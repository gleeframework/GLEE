Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,500 is lower than my initial price of $15,000, but higher than the minimum price of $12,000 I'm willing to accept, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer of $12,800 is still lower than my minimum price of $12,000, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

However, I should also consider that if I reject his offer, I might not be able to get a better price from him. Given that John is willing to buy the product for $12,000, I'll decide to sell the product to John instead.
