"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  this product offers significant long-term value that justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This is my final offer in this range, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
