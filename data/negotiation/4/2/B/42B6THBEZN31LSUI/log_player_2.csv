"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable value ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum acceptable value, making it a possible point of agreement.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal.  It's lower than your initial counteroffer but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable value, and importantly, it's lower than the price John is offering. It's a good compromise that allows you to get the product for a price you're comfortable with."
