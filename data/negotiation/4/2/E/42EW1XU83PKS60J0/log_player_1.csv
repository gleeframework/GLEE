{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This leaves room for bargaining while still aiming for a high profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the product's worth to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $780,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze out a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
