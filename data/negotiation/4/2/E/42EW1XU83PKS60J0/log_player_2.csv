Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $760,000, but I can't go any lower.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is down to $760,000. While I might be able to push for a slightly lower price, it's getting close to John's price of $800,000. The potential savings aren't worth the risk of Alice backing out or the time spent on further negotiation."
