"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value the product brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only go up to $14000.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can meet you at $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
