"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. Could you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
