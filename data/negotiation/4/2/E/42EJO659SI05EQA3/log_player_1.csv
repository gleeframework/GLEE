{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  While it's higher than Bob's perceived value, it's lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you are confident in the value of your product and are not desperate to sell. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, you have space to negotiate down to a price you're comfortable with.

Remember, the key is to find a price that works for both of you. Be prepared to negotiate and make counteroffers if necessary, but don't be afraid to walk away and sell to John if you can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept $950,000, it's not worth compromising my value. 

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will keep the negotiation going and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that still allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price of $1,100,000.
* **Keeping the deal alive:**  $1,050,000 is still a good profit for me, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Framing it positively:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us, suggesting a ""win-win"" scenario. 

This counteroffer hopefully encourages Bob to come up a bit more, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit too low for you, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,025,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting this offer opens the door for potential future deals with Bob.  He's demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, or worse, a complete breakdown in negotiations. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale with a decent profit.
* **Time is money:**  I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation, and time is valuable. 

This offer represents a good balance between maximizing my profit and securing a sale."
