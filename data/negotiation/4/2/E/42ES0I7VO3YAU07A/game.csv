"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my budget. Let's try to close this deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $8,375. It's a fair price that balances the value of the product and my target profit margin.",8375.0,Alice,5,
