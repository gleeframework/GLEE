"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1300000, so I'm thinking $1250000. Can we meet at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to $1280000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
