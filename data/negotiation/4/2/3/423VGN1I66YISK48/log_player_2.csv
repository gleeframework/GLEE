"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's minimum value. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is appealing, the true value of this product is significant. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than $1,150,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should keep trying to lower the price further.  He's already shown Alice he's serious about getting a lower price, and it's likely Alice will be willing to negotiate further rather than lose the deal entirely."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  This price would be fair to both of us.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
