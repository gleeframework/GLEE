"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $135. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Alice,5,
