"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's still a good starting point.  

* **Why not start higher?** I don't want to risk alienating Bob right away. 
* **Why not start lower?** There's no need to give away too much value initially. 

By starting at $10,000, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation but also that I value the product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair starting point and accept the offer.  If not, we can then negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I also have the option of selling to John for $12,000, which is a much better outcome for me.  Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer to $9,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my minimum. 

* **Why not counter with $10,000?** I want to show some flexibility, and  $9,500 is a more reasonable counter-offer considering Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Why not counter with $12,000?** It's unlikely Bob will agree to my minimum at this point, so I'm aiming for a more realistic compromise. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to entice Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's still not ideal, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer. I've also considered that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and I might end up having to sell to John at $12,000. 

Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 as it represents a good compromise and secures a sale."
