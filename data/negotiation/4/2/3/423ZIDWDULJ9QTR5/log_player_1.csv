Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value ($100) and my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to be positive and pique Bob's interest.  By observing his reaction to this initial high price, I can gauge his level of interest and adjust my strategy accordingly in further rounds. 
* **Backup Plan (John):** I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed buyer in John. This allows me to be firmer in negotiations, as I'm not desperate for a sale below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to find a mutually beneficial agreement, accepting a $50 loss is not in my best interest. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  To move this forward, would you consider $140?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've significantly reduced my price from the initial offer, signaling flexibility. This new price is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:**  By phrasing it as ""would you consider,"" I'm encouraging Bob to actively participate in finding a compromise and hopefully counter-propose with a higher number. 
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, I'm aware that I have a viable alternative with John.  This underlying time pressure encourages Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe we could find a price closer to my budget. Would $130 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Sale:** While not ideal, $130 is still a profitable sale for me as it's above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is likely small. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me spending more time on this negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** My time is valuable. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other potential sales and opportunities."
