Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value but avoids revealing your bottom line. The goal is to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests a willingness to discuss the price further, depending on Bob's response. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening move. How you proceed depends entirely on Bob's reaction. Be prepared to negotiate, but remember your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000."
