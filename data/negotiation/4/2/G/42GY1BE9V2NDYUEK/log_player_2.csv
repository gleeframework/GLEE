Given its value and potential impact on your endeavors, I propose a price of $15,000 for the product. This reflects not only its intrinsic worth but also the unique benefits it offers compared to similar products in the market. I understand that this might be higher than what you initially expected, but I assure you that the investment will pay off in terms of efficiency, cost savings, and competitive advantage. If you're interested in discussing further or have any questions, please let me know. Looking forward to potentially working with you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
