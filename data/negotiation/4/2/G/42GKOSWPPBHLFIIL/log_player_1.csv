"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is really my bottom line. Perhaps we can find some middle ground? How about $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,500? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is still a little above what I can comfortably spend right now. I'm going to need to stick with my previous offer of $12,000. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to seriously consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is firmly sticking to $12,000.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and we have a guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's time to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
