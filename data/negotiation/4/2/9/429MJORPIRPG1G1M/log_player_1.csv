Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try and counter with a price that's more appealing to me, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $19,000.  It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get Bob to agree, but I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer one last time, but if he rejects that, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to drop to $18,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's last offer.  If he rejects this, I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating. It's better to secure the $15,000 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
