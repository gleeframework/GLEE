"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $125.,125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 just isn't working for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,

I'm not sure about $130. I'm still a bit too high on the budget. Can we try $128?,128.0,Bob,6,
