Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Range:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob to play with.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. A good strategy is to start closer to Bob's value, leaving room for negotiation but still securing a significant portion of the potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **High Anchor:**  Starting at $1,150,000 sets a strong anchor point, leaving you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $1,150,000 â€“ a great deal!
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to go down slightly while still staying above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Your negotiation style, Bob's personality, and other factors could influence your strategy."
