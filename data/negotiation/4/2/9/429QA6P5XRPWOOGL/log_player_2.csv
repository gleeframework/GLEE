Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and it's the same price I could get from John. Hopefully, Alice will accept, but if not, we'll see where the negotiation goes."

I'm going to offer Alice $1,500,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and her latest one. Hopefully, this will be a good starting point for a more reasonable negotiation."
