# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to negotiate with her further or move on to John, knowing his maximum price point."
