{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a decent discount while still ensuring you get a good price. It leaves room for negotiation, but it's a strong starting point.  

**Why this approach?**

* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $1,250,000 is a good middle ground between your value and Bob's value, making it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** You can adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's response, allowing for a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Flexibility:** You can always choose to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob falls through, ensuring you don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $1,100,000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me.  I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  I want to find a price that's closer to my desired value without completely alienating Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value I've placed on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer while still being above his initial proposal.  It shows a willingness to negotiate and compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value and framing the price as a compromise helps justify the offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and open tone keeps the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to see if he's willing to accept this counteroffer or if we need to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to commit up to $1,075,000. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer is still significantly lower than what I consider the product's true worth. I'm not willing to settle for such a large discount, especially given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial Incentive:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a significantly higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob would likely require more time and effort, with no guarantee of a successful outcome.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of further price concessions and ensures a smooth transaction.

**Decision:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John to maximize my profit and avoid potential further losses in a drawn-out negotiation."
