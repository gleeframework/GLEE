You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? It's a fair price for a great product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $12,500? It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down significantly further. It's better to secure the product from John at the known price of $12,000 than to continue haggling with Alice and risk a higher final price."
