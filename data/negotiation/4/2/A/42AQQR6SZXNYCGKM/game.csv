"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  This product would be very valuable to me at $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,7000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $7,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",7000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $7,000 is closer, it's still a little bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $6,500?  That would be a great price for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I can see that you're getting close to your budget, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $6,800, which is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. I'm getting closer to meeting you halfway, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",6800.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I could meet you halfway at $6,650.  That's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.",6650.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,6700.0
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. I can see that $6,650 is a reasonable price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $6,700, which is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",6700.0,Alice,7,,
