"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the first offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I see the value in the product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer.  $8,500 is a good starting point because it's still above the product's worth to Alice, so there's a chance she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a win-win! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $9,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still above his desired target. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step down from Alice's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is a good middle ground, leaving room for Alice to accept while still allowing Bob to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $8,750 is close, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we settle at $8,900? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly.  While $8,900 is not Bob's ideal price, it's a good deal.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential of buying from John for $10,000, accepting this offer is the most logical decision.  Bob saves $1,100 compared to John's price and $600 compared to his initial counteroffer."
