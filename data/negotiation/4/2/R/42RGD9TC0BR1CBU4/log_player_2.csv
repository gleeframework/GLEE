"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $80 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I propose to sell it to you for $95. This offer includes an exclusive 10% discount on the standard price, making it a great opportunity for you to benefit from exceptional value. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is misleading and overpriced. You know the product is worth $80 to you and that John will sell it to you at that price. There's no reason to pay $15 more for a supposed ""discount."""
