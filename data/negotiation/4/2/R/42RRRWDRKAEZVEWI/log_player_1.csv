This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but leaving room for some bargaining.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  I'll counter with a higher price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $14,250? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not happy with it.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer, but if he rejects it, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $14,250 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $14,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $14,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I've already had several rounds of negotiation and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to come to an agreement.  I'm going to sell to John, as his offer is right at my minimum and guarantees me the best outcome."
