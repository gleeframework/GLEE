# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is too high, and he can get the product for less from either Alice or John.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't let this go for less than $13,000. This is already a very competitive price for what the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to his maximum, he can still get it for cheaper from John. He should try to counteroffer Alice again to see if he can get closer to his target price."
