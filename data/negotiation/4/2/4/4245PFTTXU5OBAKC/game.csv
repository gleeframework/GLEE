"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $95 just yet. I'm thinking of a price of $102.50. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it for the value the product brings.",102.5,Alice,5,
