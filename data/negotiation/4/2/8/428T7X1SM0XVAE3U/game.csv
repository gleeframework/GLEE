"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $80? That's my absolute top end for this.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  $80 is just too low for me to accept. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm willing to come down a bit more to make this work for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this. $115 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $95, but that's my final offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.  This is a fair price that's still a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $105 is still over my budget. I can go up to $98, which is a fair compromise and closer to my limit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",98.0,Bob,6,
