"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John is offering.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $8,000."
