{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming to get a bit more than my minimum price, but I'm also willing to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $11,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum. While I'd like to sell,  I'm not desperate. I'll counter and try to get closer to my target. I'm still comfortable selling to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $10,250? It's still a great price for you, and I'm happy to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,250 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $9,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm not sure how much more I can push him, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  $9,750 is a decent price, and I'm willing to accept it at this point."
