"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my genuine desire to reach a deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $975,000 is getting closer to a palatable figure, we still have room to negotiate. Bob's incremental increases suggest he's willing to move towards our price point. We'll aim slightly above his offer in the next round to maintain a strong negotiating position."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below your latest offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $990,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** We are getting close to the point where accepting might be the best option, but Bob's latest offer is still a significant margin away from our desired price. He's steadily increasing his offers, indicating a willingness to negotiate. We'll push a bit further in the next round to test his flexibility."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I'm proposing $1,001,250. This offer reflects a serious commitment from my side and brings us very close to an agreement. I'm confident this price represents a win-win scenario for both of us."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below your latest offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $985,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this stage, Bob's incremental increases are getting smaller, and he seems unwilling to substantially increase his offer. The difference between his current offer ($985,000) and our secured price with John ($1,200,000) is significant enough to warrant cutting negotiations. Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him dropping out entirely or prolonging the negotiation, potentially leading to a worse outcome. Selling to John guarantees the desired profit."
