"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price, you can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice. There's room for a lower offer since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. You'll aim to find a price closer to her valuation to maximize your savings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a better price closer to $8,500.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth another round to see if we can find common ground."
