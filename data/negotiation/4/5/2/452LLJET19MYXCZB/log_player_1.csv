{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a good price that's still attractive to Bob. It also provides a reason for Bob to accept, highlighting the product's value to him. If Bob rejects, we'll adjust the price based on his counteroffer and keep the negotiations going until we reach a satisfactory price or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still less than I'd like to get. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher by sending a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, it's a reasonable compromise and a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000."
