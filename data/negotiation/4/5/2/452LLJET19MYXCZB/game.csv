"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
