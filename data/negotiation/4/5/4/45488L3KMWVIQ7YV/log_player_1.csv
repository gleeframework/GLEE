"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a bit more than $7,500. I'm confident I can get a better price."
