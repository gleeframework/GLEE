"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $8000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $8000. How about we compromise at $8800?
