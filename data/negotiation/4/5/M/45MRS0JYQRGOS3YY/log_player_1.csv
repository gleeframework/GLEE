Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than the value I place on the product.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price reflects the value you've stated while still being fair for me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still a significant loss for me.  I have several rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob.  I'm not yet ready to accept a price that is below my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.  I'm open to discussing other options, but I can't go lower than this."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,700.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure we're going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in round 8 and Bob's final offer is $9,000. This is still significantly lower than the value I place on the product, and I'm not willing to accept a loss of that magnitude. With only two rounds remaining, it's highly unlikely that I'll be able to negotiate a better price with Bob.  It's better to sell the product to John for $15,000 and secure a much better outcome."
