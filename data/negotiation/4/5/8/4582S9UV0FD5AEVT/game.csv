"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I am willing to negotiate further.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap.",105.0,Bob,4,
