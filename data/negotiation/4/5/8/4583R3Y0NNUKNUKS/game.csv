"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,500 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $7,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be possible?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $6,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we compromise at $7,200? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,700. How about we meet at $7,100? It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",7100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting too drawn out. My absolute final offer is $6,800.  If you can't do that, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John's offer.",6800.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,800. I've already compromised a lot, and I think I deserve a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $7,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal at this price.",7000.0,Alice,9,
