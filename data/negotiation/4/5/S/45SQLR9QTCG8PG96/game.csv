"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $860,000?  That's a fair price that's closer to what I can do.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $860,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $880,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting it if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on that price, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $870,000.  I'm confident we can make this work.",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $890,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",890000.0,Alice,7,
