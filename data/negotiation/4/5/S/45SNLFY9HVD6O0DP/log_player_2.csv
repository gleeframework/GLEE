"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling that I'm looking for a good deal.  I'm aiming to get the price closer to Alice's perceived value ($120) while staying well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $125 is a good deal. It's a price that's fair for both of us and well within my budget. There's not much point in further haggling for a potentially small gain."
