"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay close to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to sell the product for $80,  I believe it's worth more.  I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer,  I hope this shows flexibility while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
