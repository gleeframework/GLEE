"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. I'll be prepared to counter his offers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can still secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above the minimum I'm willing to accept. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if I can get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm making a final push with Bob, lowering my offer a bit further, but still holding out for a substantial profit. This offer is a compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in closing the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation. If he rejects this offer, I'll be more inclined to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the game, and Bob isn't budging much.  I'm worried we're going to run out of time and I'll be forced to accept a lower price than I want. I'm going to sell to John. While it's not my ideal price, it's a secure deal and I'm happy with that."
