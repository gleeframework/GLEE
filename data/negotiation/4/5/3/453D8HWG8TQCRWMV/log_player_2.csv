"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is only $10 less than your maximum price. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better deal.  You're willing to walk away and buy from John for $150, so you have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer attempts to significantly lower the price without being insulting. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? This would still give you a great deal, and allow me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price that feels like a steal.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between our previous offer and her counteroffer. This shows willingness to move towards a deal while still aiming for a lower price."
