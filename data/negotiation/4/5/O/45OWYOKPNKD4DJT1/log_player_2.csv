"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than the $1,000,000 John is offering.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage the offer from John to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with buying from John."
