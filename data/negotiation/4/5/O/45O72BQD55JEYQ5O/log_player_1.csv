Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm going to see if Bob is seriously interested and gauge his potential willingness to pay.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I'm going to try to get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still trying to get a good price.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer, and while it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure a sale. It's important to remember that the longer the negotiation goes on, the riskier it becomes. I'm happy with this price and don't want to risk losing the deal by trying to push for more."
