"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price, even though I know it's above Bob's current valuation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial offer aims to establish a strong bargaining position and potentially lead Bob to counter with a figure closer to his perceived value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the opportunity to consider this product. I understand its value, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000. I have room to negotiate and will try to bring him closer to my desired price point in the next round. I'm not willing to accept a loss when I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's unique nature and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm lowering my initial price by $300,000 to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm still aiming significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.  The goal is to move him closer to my price range.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Continuing to emphasize the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies a higher price.
* **Strategic Concessions:**  I'm making substantial concessions early on, which could encourage Bob to reciprocate with more significant counteroffers in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
