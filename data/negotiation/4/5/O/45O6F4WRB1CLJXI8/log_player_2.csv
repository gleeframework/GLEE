"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in learning more? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm not interested in paying $120 for the product. I can get it from John for $150, which is still within my budget of $150. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy from John.
