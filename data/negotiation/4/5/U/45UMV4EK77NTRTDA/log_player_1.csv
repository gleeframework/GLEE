Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum threshold of $800,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better offer from him. It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale than risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
