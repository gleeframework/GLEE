"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're willing to negotiate. How about we start at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price. Starting with a low counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** We want to keep the negotiation amicable. While our offer is low, we frame it politely and as a starting point for discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still closer to our ideal price. We're playing a game of inches at this point, and it's worth seeing if we can get her to budge a little more before going to John's backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counter-offer aims to find a compromise. By suggesting $70, we're splitting the difference between her latest offer ($75) and our previous counter-offer ($65). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** While we have rounds left,  mentioning ""meeting in the middle"" might subtly encourage Alice to make a decision sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to compromise further. Our counteroffer is $72 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down to $72, which is a reasonable price and only $8 above our absolute limit with John.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal at this point.  There's a risk Alice might hold firm, and we'd end up with John's $80 offer anyway. 
* **Time:**  We've already used half our rounds. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids dragging out the negotiation unnecessarily."
