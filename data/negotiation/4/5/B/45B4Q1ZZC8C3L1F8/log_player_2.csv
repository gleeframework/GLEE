# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $8,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach your ideal price point. You have a guaranteed option with John for $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of her not going low enough, leaving you to either overpay or start the process again with another seller."
