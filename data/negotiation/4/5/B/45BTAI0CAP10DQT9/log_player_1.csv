``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) rather than immediately dropping to the middle ground. This shows confidence in my product's value. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" situation for both of us, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the door open for a successful negotiation."
