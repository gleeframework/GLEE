This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum ($15,000) but still potentially appealing to Bob.  By offering a lower price initially, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept it at this point. I will try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
