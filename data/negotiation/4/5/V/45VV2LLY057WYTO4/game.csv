"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm looking for $11,500 for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's find a way to make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
