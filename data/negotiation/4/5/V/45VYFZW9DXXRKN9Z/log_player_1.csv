"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's worth to encourage Bob to see the value in the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I end with a question to invite a response and keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I still believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reaffirming value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Open communication:** I invite Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget. Could we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher than the previous round, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still potential for compromise, and I'm willing to explore it further.
* **John remains a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to reach a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $9,750 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer of $10,125 is the exact midpoint between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,750. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and signals a genuine desire to close the deal.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect of my offer, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and fairness.
* **Keeping the conversation positive:** I continue to use positive language and maintain a friendly tone, fostering a collaborative atmosphere."
