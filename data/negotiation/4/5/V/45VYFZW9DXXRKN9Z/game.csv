"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget. Could we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $9,750 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",10125.0,Alice,5,
