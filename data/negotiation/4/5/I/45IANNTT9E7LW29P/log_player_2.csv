"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to buy from Alice at this point. Her offer is exactly what you would pay John. By rejecting the offer, you open up the possibility of getting a better price from Alice in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer like $10,000 will likely be rejected by Alice, but it establishes a lower starting point for negotiation. It demonstrates your intent to pay less than her initial price and initiates the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than what I'd pay John. Since I have more rounds to negotiate, I'll reject her offer and continue attempting to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal target. It's a reasonable jump from my previous counteroffer, and it might make Alice more likely to accept as we get closer to the middle ground."
