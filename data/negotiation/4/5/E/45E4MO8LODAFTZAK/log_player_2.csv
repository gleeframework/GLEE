"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing a fair price. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose an initial price of $11000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial valuation of $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better price. He has 10 rounds to negotiate, and the option of buying from John for $10,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to both benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To find a mutually beneficial solution, I would like to counterpropose a price of $10800 for the product. This offers a slight increase from your offer while still providing a good value for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate further.  He has 7 rounds remaining and the option to buy from John for $10,000.  There's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,800.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad to hear that we're getting closer to finding a mutually agreeable price, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I would like to suggest a counterprice of $10700 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and could lead to a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating a lower price, but Alice is not budging much.  He only has 5 rounds left, and there's no guarantee he'll be able to get the price down to $10,600 or lower. 

Given the option to buy from John for $10,000, it's a safer bet to take that option now.  He's already saved $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer, and there's no guarantee he'll get a better deal with Alice."
