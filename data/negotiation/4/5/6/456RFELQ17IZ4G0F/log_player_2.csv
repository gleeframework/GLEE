Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $985,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather secure the product than continue to haggle for a small amount of money."
