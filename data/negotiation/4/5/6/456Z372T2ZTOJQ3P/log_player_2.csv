"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, you can likely get it for a lower price.  By rejecting the offer, you can counter with a lower price and potentially save even more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for a little less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the product for a little less. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  At $850,000, I'm saving $150,000 compared to buying from John. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John at the full price is not worth it. It's a good deal, and I'll accept."
