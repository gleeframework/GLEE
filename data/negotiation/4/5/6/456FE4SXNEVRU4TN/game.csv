"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $10,200 for the product?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,200 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $10,350.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to where we want to be. What do you say?",10350.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. I'd like to counter with $10,300 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",10300.0,Bob,6,
