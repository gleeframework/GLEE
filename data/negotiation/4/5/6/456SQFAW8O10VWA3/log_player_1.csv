Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, Alice. Considering our financial constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $825,000. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between our positions.

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $825,000 is a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
