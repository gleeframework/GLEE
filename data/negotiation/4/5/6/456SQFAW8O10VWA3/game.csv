"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to counteroffer at $800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the value this product brings. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. However, I still believe that $800,000 is a fair price considering our budget constraints. Let's aim for a compromise at $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $875,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, Alice. Considering our financial constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $825,000. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between our positions.",825000.0,Bob,6,
