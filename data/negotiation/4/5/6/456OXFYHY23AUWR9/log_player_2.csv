"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is a bit too close to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and aims to understand her lower limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $110 is too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is willing to meet in the middle, and $125 is a good price, saving you $25 off John's price and a decent amount off Alice's initial offer."
