"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as he's guaranteed to get the product within his budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks either getting a worse deal or running out of rounds before securing the product."
