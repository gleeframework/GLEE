"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a significant sum for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1000000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1000000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $900000.  This represents a significant investment for me and would allow us to complete this transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Considering your last offer of $900000, I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is sufficient for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth, but I'm open to further discussion. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
