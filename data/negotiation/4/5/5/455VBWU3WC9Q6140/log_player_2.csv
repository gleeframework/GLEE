Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is sufficient for the product's value.

What are your thoughts?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
