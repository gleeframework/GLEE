"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $120
* **Your value:** $150
* **John's price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer means you save $30 ($150 - $120).  Rejecting the offer means you have to buy from John at a higher price. Buying from John gets you the product but doesn't save you any money compared to buying from Alice."
