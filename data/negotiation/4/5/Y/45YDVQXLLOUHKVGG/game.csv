"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,250. Can we discuss further?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,875? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale.",9875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9500.0,Bob,6,
