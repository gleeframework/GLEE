Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
Bob is unwilling to budge above his budget, which is equal to my minimum acceptable price.  There's no room for negotiation to increase his offer. It makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further time spent in negotiations."
