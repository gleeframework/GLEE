"I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer. However, $1400000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to you and the potential we both see in it, I'm willing to go down to $1550000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and it allows us both to move forward with this opportunity. Let's close this deal and make it happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
