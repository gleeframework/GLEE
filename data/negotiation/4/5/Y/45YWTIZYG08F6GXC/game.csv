"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $11,500, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to go a bit lower to make this work for both of us?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
