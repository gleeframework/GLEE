"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is below Bob's maximum budget, he can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  He knows Alice values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.  This initial offer is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a more favorable outcome for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price, and he has more rounds to negotiate. Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price. While buying from John is always an option, Bob can potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's gauging Alice's willingness to compromise and seeing if they can reach a mutually agreeable price.  $1,250,000 is a significant price reduction from Alice's last offer and is closer to Bob's desired price. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. While he could continue negotiating,  the risk of not reaching a deal and losing the opportunity to buy from John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price from Alice.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, ensuring a successful purchase."
