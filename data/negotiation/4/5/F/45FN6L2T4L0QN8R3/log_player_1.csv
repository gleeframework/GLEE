I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it establishes a strong starting point and shows I'm serious about getting my value. I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is simply not enough for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to meet me halfway."
