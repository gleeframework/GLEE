"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me.  Could you do $9,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's closer to your target price.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, there's no immediate need to accept. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
