"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you thinking of me. I'm very interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7500? I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal if you agree.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $8200. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal. Let me know if this works for you!",8200.0,Alice,3,
