Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $14,000 is a good starting point, close to my ideal price but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to discussion:** I end with a friendly tone, inviting Bob to respond and engage in negotiation.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept (if it's close enough) or make a new counteroffer. If the negotiation stalls or his offers are too low, I'll switch to John and sell for $10,000 to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$12,500 is too low:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer is still significantly below my desired price of $14,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my goal. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me the flexibility to push for a better deal with Bob without risking a complete loss.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $13,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,500, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain value:**  I'm still above Bob's offer of $12,500, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to lower the price further or if it's time to move on to John and sell for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? I'm willing to make a decision soon, so let me know if that's something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  $13,000 is only $500 away from my desired price of $13,500.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  Further negotiation could risk losing Bob as a buyer.  He's indicated a willingness to make a decision, so delaying could lead to him walking away.
* **John is a fallback:**  If I reject, I can still secure a sale with John for $10,000.

**Next steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and complete the sale, securing a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
