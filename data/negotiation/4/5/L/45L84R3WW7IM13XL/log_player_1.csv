Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to make an offer of $1,800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,000,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his $1,400,000 offer. Accepting a lower price means losing out on a substantial sum.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
