Alice's offer is way too high.  It's much better to reject and counteroffer."

While $19,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll try to negotiate further."

Alice is still not willing to come down to a price that works for me.  It's clear we're too far apart, and I'm better off buying from John at $8,000."
