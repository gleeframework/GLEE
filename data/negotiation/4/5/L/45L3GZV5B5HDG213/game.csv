"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. $1200000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, considering the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure I can go as high as $1700000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still below the value I need to reach. I'm willing to compromise further, let's meet in the middle at $1550000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is a fair price given the product's potential.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
