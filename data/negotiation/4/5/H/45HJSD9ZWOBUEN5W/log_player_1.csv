Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000.  I know this product holds significant value for you, and this is a fair offer considering its potential.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, Bob is willing to pay more. My goal is to get as close to his $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 gives Bob a substantial saving ($200,000) compared to his perceived value. This makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
