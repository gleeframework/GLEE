Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. Since you don't know Bob's valuation, offering a price higher than your minimum allows for a potential win-win scenario. If Bob is willing to pay more than $15,000, you'll make more than you would selling to John. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of getting a higher price."
