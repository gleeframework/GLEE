"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a product worth $12,000 to you for a lower price. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? I think that's a fair price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $9,250? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. While I appreciate your coming down a bit,  $9,250 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
