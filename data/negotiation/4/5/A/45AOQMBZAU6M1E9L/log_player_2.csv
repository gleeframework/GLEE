"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it can significantly benefit you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure a better price. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  The counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money. 
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the lower price, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This helps build a foundation for further negotiation. 
* **Openness:**  The message ends by suggesting a willingness to compromise, showing that Bob is open to finding a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand your position, the $1,200,000 offer falls a bit short of what I had in mind. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and to reflect its true value, I'm proposing $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still a $150,000 difference.  
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John guarantees a product, the potential savings from further negotiation outweigh the risk of losing the deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  Let's meet in the middle.  $1,300,000 is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob is proposing a price halfway between Alice's offer and his previous counteroffer. This shows a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing value:** The message reiterates the product's value, reminding Alice that Bob still sees it as valuable.
* **Confidence and finality:**  The message conveys confidence in the offer being accepted and implies a sense of finality. This adds a bit of pressure on Alice to agree."
