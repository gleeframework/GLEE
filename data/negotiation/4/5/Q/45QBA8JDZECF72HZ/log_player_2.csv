"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and he can get it from John for that price.  Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's, but still not the best deal for Bob.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
