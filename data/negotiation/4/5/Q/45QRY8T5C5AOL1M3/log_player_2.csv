"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,200. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm counteroffering at $9,000, which is my minimum price. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has rejected Alice's offer twice, and Alice has come down to $9,000, which is close to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and walk away from the deal.  Additionally, Bob only has 5 rounds left, and he doesn't want to run out of time.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without risking a breakdown in the negotiations."
