"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,200. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements.
