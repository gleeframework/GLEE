"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I would be making a decent profit while you get a good value for the product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
