Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Offering a Fair Price:**  Starting with a ""fair"" price creates a positive negotiation environment.  
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The price is high enough to leave room for Bob to counter, while still allowing me to potentially profit.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I can immediately move to John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **I have a guaranteed alternative with John.**  I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Negotiating further with Bob could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price.**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob, and the longer I negotiate, the more likely it is that John might change his mind or find another option.

**Next Steps:** 

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to accommodate your needs.  This price still reflects the product's worth and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer  is a significant jump from Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  It shows flexibility while leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The price is still high enough that I can comfortably walk away if Bob rejects this offer.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts, I'll be happy to finalize the sale.**
* **If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.** 
* **If the negotiation stalls, I'll move to John to secure my minimum acceptable price.**"

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
