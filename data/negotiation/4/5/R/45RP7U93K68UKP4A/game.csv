"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $22000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $22000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $18500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $16500.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $17000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $16000.  I think this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",16800.0,Alice,7,
