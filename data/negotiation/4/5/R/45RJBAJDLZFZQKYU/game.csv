"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your counter offer, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to come up to $870,000 to make this deal happen.",870000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $870,000, which puts us at $885,000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",885000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that price is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. To be fair to you, I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is my final offer.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $900,000 again, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",900000.0,Alice,7,
