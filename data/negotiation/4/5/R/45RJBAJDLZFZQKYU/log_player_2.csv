Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $900,000 again, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.

It's clear Alice is not budging from the $900,000 mark.  She's trying to sweeten the deal with extras, but those don't guarantee additional value to me.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John.  While I'll be paying a premium, it's better than getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice."
