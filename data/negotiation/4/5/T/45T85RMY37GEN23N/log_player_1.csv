Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $875,000. Could you consider meeting me at $875,000? I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe we can negotiate Bob a bit higher.  We'll concede a smaller amount this round to see how he responds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. Let's make this happen - I'll come down to $885,000, which represents a significant discount on the value it offers. I'm hopeful this allows us to close the deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is stubbornly sticking to smaller increments, and we're getting close to a price point where the difference in potential earnings isn't worth the risk of him walking away. We'll push one more time to gauge his seriousness."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my number for this to make sense.  My final offer is $870,000.  This is a very competitive price for the value you're receiving. Let me know your decision - I'm optimistic we can get this done."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $865,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can meet me at this price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,000.

While we could push Bob further, he's moved up considerably from his initial offer and is now only $5,000 away from our last counter. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
