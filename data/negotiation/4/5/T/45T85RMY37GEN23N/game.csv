"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm excited to see it put to good use. To start the negotiations, I'm offering it at $950,000.  This feels like a fair starting point given its value proposition.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $875,000. Could you consider meeting me at $875,000? I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. Let's make this happen - I'll come down to $885,000, which represents a significant discount on the value it offers. I'm hopeful this allows us to close the deal.",885000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we settle at $862,500?",862500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my number for this to make sense.  My final offer is $870,000.  This is a very competitive price for the value you're receiving. Let me know your decision - I'm optimistic we can get this done.",870000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $865,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can meet me at this price point.",865000.0,Bob,8,
