"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for the product. It's a significant investment for me, and I'd need to be confident in the price to move forward.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
