Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly imply the product is worth the high price without explicitly stating it's worth more to Bob.
* **Urgency:**  A ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and might make him less likely to overthink a potential counter-offer.

**Important:**  This is just an opening move. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. You can always come down to a price that's still significantly higher than your guaranteed $800,000 from John."
