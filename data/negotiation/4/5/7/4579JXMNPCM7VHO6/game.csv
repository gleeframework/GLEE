"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $9,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
