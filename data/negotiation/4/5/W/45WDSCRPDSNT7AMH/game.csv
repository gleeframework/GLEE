"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. This is a competitive price considering the product's exceptional features and benefits. I'm open to discussing and adjusting the price based on your feedback.

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value and your budget, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and benefits. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the product's value, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints. Let's try to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept below my minimum. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept $950000. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise on my part, and I believe it's the closest we can get to a fair price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
