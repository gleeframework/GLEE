"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $12,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to offer $8,000 to start the negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,500 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $8,750? I believe that's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the price, but I have to stick to my budget.  My final offer is $8,900. If that doesn't work, I may have to consider other options.",8900.0,Bob,6,
