# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $12,000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.

Alice is holding firm at $9,000 and we're running out of rounds. Accepting $9,100 saves us $900 compared to John's price. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
