"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages a positive response and reduces the risk of Bob immediately rejecting a high offer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $14,000 leaves space for me to drop the price in future rounds if Bob counteroffers.
* **Backup Plan:**  If negotiations fail, I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can get the product for a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  I have 8 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to reach a more favorable deal. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Even if I don't reach a satisfactory price with Bob, I have John as a guaranteed buyer for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $12,000 but lower than my initial offer. This allows me to explore the middle ground and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would help me reach a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $13,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise. This is halfway between my last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000).
* **Appeal to Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product and the ""great deal"" it represents for Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects it.  If he counteroffers, I have another round to adjust my price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations amicable."
