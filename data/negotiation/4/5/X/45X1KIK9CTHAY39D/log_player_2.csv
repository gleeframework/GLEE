# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice is still asking for more than the product is worth to Bob.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
