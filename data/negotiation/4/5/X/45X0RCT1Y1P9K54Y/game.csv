"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own minimum price for the product.

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $15000. I've already made several concessions to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,9,
