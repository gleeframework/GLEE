"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is less than what John is selling it for, you can still potentially get a better deal.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $105, which is still a good deal for her as it's more than what the product is worth to her.  This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also trying to get a price closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is now within my budget, and it's a better price than what John is offering.  While I'd ideally like to pay less, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
