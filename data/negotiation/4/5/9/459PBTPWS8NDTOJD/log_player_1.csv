"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but I believe it sets the stage for a strong negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so this price gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to settle. I'll counteroffer again in the next round and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, I'm confident that $1,625,000 is a good price.  I'm also running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
