"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to meet you halfway. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. Let's try to close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm ready to pay $1,050,000, and I believe that's a fair price given my budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that you're being firm on your budget, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price reflects the value of the product to you while allowing me to recover some of my investment. Let's finalize this deal, I'm sure we can both be happy with this outcome.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
