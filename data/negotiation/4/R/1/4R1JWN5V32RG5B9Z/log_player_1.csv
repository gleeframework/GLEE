"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect, hinting at the value Bob would get.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, making the negotiation more interactive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price.** While $8,500 is higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my target. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I have 8 more rounds.  Rejecting this offer gives me a chance to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not rejecting it outright. I'm proposing a counter-offer that is closer to my desired price but still a compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to reinforce my price point. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Approach:**  This phrase suggests that I'm being reasonable and open to finding a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference at $9000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:** $9,000 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000. 
* **Deal Closing:** Bob is indicating a willingness to close at this price, suggesting it's a good deal for him.
* **Time Factor:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might get a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away or John's offer changing is too high. 

Accepting this offer secures a good price and a successful negotiation."
