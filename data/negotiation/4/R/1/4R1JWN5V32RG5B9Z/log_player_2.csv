"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. He has 10 rounds to work with and the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob wants to start the negotiation with a lower price to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $8,500 is still a good profit for Alice, but significantly less than her initial offer. 
* **Friendly tone:**  Bob keeps the tone friendly to maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice has come down, $9,500 is still more than Bob is comfortable paying. He wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. Bob can continue to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.
* **John is a safety net:** If the negotiations fail, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9500, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference at $9000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint:** Bob proposes a price that's exactly halfway between his previous offer ($8500) and Alice's offer ($9500). 
* **Clear intention:**  He emphasizes that he's ready to close the deal at this price, showing Alice that he's serious about making a deal.
* **Finality:**  Bob is starting to move towards his limit, so this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted."
