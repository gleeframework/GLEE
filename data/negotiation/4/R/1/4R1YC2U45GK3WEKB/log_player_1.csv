Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I can afford to start with an ambitious offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It shows I'm willing to engage but also value the product highly.
* **Psychological Impact:**  A strong initial offer can sometimes anchor the negotiation in my favor. 

**Important Note:** Even though John provides a safety net, my ultimate goal is to maximize profit. I don't want to scare Bob away with an unreasonable price, but I want to aim for the highest possible return."
