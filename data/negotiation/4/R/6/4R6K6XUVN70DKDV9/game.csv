"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $14,500? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers."
"I understand that $16,500 is a better offer than $14,500, but I was really hoping to get it for $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $16,000. This is the best I can do.",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $15,750. This is the lowest I can go."
"I've made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm confident that $15,750 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm starting to lose confidence that we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $15,750. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",15750.0,Alice,5,,
