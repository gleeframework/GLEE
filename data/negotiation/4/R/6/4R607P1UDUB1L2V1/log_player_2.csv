Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9,000 is below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $9,500?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,200.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation to potentially save only $200."
