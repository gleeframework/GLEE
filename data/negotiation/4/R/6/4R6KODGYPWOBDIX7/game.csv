"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
