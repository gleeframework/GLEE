Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:**  You're still making a significant profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum value:**  Giving him a good deal increases his incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go your way."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's worth seeing if you can push for a bit more.  You're still in a strong position, and a slight counteroffer might be enough to get him to accept."

You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

At this point, it's getting close to your minimum price. You've already rejected a few offers, and Bob seems firm on his price.  Accepting his offer ensures you get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially selling to John for less."
