"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, knowing Bob has a lower value for the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my full $10,000 value because that would make Bob immediately reject the offer. I want to give him some room to bargain. 
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **More rounds to explore:**  I have 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to close the deal closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This takes into account your needs and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  My message highlights Bob's interest in the product, suggesting it's valuable to him, while also emphasizing fairness.
* **Creating urgency:**  The ""Let's get this done!"" phrase encourages Bob to accept the offer to move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.
* **Time is running out:**  While I could potentially get a better price in future rounds, time is becoming a factor.  
* **John is a safe option:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees I reach my minimum goal.

I need to carefully consider the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since I'm already in the fourth round.  While I could try to get a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll be successful.  Selling to John is a safer option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $7,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $8,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** I'm coming down from my previous offer, but only by a small amount.  This shows a willingness to negotiate, but it doesn't give away too much ground.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I reiterate the idea of a ""fair compromise,"" making the offer seem more reasonable and less like a hard stance.
* **Creating urgency:**  The ""Let's make this happen!"" phrase encourages Bob to accept the offer and move the negotiation forward. 

I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes a more appealing option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short, but I'm willing to meet you at $8000. That's my absolute maximum budget, and I'm hoping you can work with me on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're already in round 6, and I have only 4 rounds left. 
* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **No guarantee of a better offer:** While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired value, with no risk of losing time or ending up with a lower price.

Given the limited time and the risk of getting a lower price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John to ensure I achieve my minimum goal."
