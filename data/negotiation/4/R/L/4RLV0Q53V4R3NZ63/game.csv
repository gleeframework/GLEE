"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $8800.  This takes into account your needs and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's get this done!",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but unfortunately, $7500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $8500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,5,
