Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to stick to my initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000, but we know the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. There's still room for negotiation. We're not in a rush, and John's offer provides a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your consistency, but I'm confident this product can bring you significant value beyond $1,200,000.  Let's settle this - $1,275,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show flexibility, but be firm:** We're moving closer to his price but still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Create a sense of urgency:** Phrasing like ""settle this"" can nudge him to act.
* **Odd pricing:** The $1,275,000 figure feels more considered than another round $1,250,000.

We're getting into the later rounds, so a bit more pressure is strategic."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm not willing to budge on this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is anchored at $1,200,000 and unlikely to move. While we could push for more, we're already above our minimum, and further negotiation has diminishing returns.  Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
