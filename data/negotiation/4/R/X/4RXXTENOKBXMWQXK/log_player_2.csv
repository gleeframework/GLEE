"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's no reason to immediately accept the first offer.  Bob can try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no information about the value of the product to Alice, so there's potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This is a bold move, but it establishes Bob's intention to negotiate seriously. It's possible Alice might reject this offer, but it also gives her an incentive to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still within Bob's budget. However, Bob is still motivated to get a better deal and can continue to negotiate.  It's possible that Alice will continue to lower her price as the rounds progress. Buying from John right now doesn't offer any advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's previous price, but it shows that Bob is serious about closing a deal. It's a good balance between pushing for a lower price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and while it's still higher than Bob's last counteroffer, it's now only $500 above his maximum willingness to pay. Given the limited rounds, it's a good idea to accept this offer.  The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might not lower the price further, or she might even raise it.  At this point, saving $500 is a good outcome, and it ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
