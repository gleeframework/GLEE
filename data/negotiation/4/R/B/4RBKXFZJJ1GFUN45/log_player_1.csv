"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the value the product offers. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $10,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I have 10 rounds, so there's still time to negotiate a better price.  
* **John is a backup:** I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I don't get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I frame the offer as a ""meeting halfway,"" emphasizing a fair and balanced solution.
* **Reinforce Value:**  I subtly remind Bob of the value of the product by suggesting it leaves ""room for both of us to be satisfied."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle on $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time to push:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, which is enough time to potentially get a better offer.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can still sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,375?  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?"", ""product_price"": 10375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm still showing willingness to compromise, but I'm pushing back a bit to avoid settling too low.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""meeting in the middle,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintain Momentum:** By proposing a specific number, I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward and preventing it from stalling."
