"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle on $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,375?  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?",10375.0,Alice,5,
