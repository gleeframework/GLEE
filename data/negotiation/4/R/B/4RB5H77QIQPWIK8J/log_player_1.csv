Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and maximizes my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone can help keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to counter with a lower price. I'm prepared to negotiate further. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Backup:** Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not desperate to sell yet. I have leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,500? This is a fair price considering both our values for the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and makes it easier for Bob to consider a compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm mentioning that the price is fair based on both our perspectives. This can help Bob understand the value of the product and encourage him to accept.
* **Remaining firm:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I am still in a good position if Bob rejects."
