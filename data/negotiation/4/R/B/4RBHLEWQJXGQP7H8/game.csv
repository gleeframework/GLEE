"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand the value this product brings to your business. However,  $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the substantial value I believe it holds for you while still being a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible,  $920,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $935,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to move forward with this deal. Let me know what you think.",935000.0,Alice,5,
