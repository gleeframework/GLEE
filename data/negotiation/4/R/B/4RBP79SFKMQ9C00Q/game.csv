"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $12000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16000, which is a bit higher than your offer but still a good compromise. I believe the product's value to you will be worth the extra $4000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $16000 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $14000 is a more reasonable price. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $15500, which is a bit higher than your latest offer but still a good compromise. I believe the product's value to you will be worth the extra $1500.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to pay $13500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to pay $13500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm thinking of a price of $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,7,
