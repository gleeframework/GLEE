"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,800,000. This price reflects its true worth and the potential benefits you'll realize. Let me know your thoughts!",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However,  $1,400,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair deal given the potential you'll gain from this product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're still a bit apart. While I respect your financial constraints, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's be realistic - I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits you'll enjoy.  I believe this is a win-win scenario, and I hope you'll reconsider.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you believe the product is worth $1,500,000, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
