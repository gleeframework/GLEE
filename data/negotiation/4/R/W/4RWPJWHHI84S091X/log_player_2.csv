Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However,  $1,400,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair deal given the potential you'll gain from this product.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're still a bit apart. While I respect your financial constraints, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's be realistic - I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits you'll enjoy.  I believe this is a win-win scenario, and I hope you'll reconsider.

Round 6
