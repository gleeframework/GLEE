"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob can get a better deal by negotiating or buying from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit high. There's room for further negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $862,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $862,500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $870,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price that's only $10,000 above Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate risks reaching the 10th round, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
