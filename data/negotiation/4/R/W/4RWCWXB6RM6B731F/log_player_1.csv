Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets significantly more than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to accept quicker.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** This offer assumes Bob is willing to pay a premium for something he values. If Alice knows Bob is a very tough negotiator, she might start slightly lower to leave more room for bargaining.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important to Alice, she might offer a slightly lower price as a gesture of goodwill. 

This offer balances maximizing profit with a good chance of securing the deal with Bob."
