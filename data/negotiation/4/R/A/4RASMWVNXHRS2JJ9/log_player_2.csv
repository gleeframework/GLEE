"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. However, $15,000 is my absolute limit. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,500 lower than her initial price and only $1,500 higher than my counteroffer.  This is a reasonable compromise and a good deal for me.  It's better than going to John and paying the full $15,000."
