"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $1050000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while still leaving room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to lower the price to $1150000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you while also considering my minimum price. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your desired price.  While I value the product, $1150000 is still above my ideal range. Let's try $1100000. This would be a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I believe it shows my commitment to closing this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I meet my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1150000 was a bit too high, but I can do $1120000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this price.
