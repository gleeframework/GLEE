Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $1050000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while still leaving room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
