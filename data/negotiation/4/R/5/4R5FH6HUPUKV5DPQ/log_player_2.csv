# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $130 is a fair price, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $145. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $145 is still more than you're willing to pay.  By rejecting, you can continue to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that works better for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $135.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I think $137.50 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $137.50 is still higher than my ideal price, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and this price is close enough to my target that it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation rounds."
