Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110, Bob. I was thinking more like $125. That way, we can both feel good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $100 price."
