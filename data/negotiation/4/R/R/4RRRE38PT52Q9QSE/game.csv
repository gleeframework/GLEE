"Bob, $12,000 is too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but this product is truly worth more.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $14,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800?",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your time and want to reach an agreement. $12,800 is still a bit low for me. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $13,500. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
