"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $80. It's a fair price considering the product's value and I'd like to make a deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept it!",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $85. Can you consider this offer?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $90.  This is a fair price considering its value and allows us both to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,5,
