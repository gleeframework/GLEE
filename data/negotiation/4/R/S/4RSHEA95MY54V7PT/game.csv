"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. How about $10,500? That's still a good profit for you, and it saves me a little bit of money.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,900. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,3,
