"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's value of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer opens the door for a counteroffer and further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. How about $10,500? That's still a good profit for you, and it saves me a little bit of money."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,900. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is a good compromise. It's lower than the initial $11,000 offer and closer to Bob's desired price point. It also leaves Alice with a profit margin. Accepting the offer saves Bob $100 compared to buying from John and ensures a successful purchase."
