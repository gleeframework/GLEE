Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you have any questions. We look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that might be more favorable or allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at your desired price."
