"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $105. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm still a bit above your budget, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think!",108.0,Alice,3,
