Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but based on my research and budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the $15000 price point. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I'm hoping for something closer to $12000 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
