"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a higher price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise between our previous offers.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
