"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $6,000 is significantly below what the product is worth, especially considering its value to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. To be completely transparent, I have a budget of $8,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price? It would be a quick and easy deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
