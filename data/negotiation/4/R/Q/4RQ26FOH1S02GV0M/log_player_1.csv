{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but he's still significantly below the product's value to both of us. It's time to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't make a substantial jump."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find a price that works for both of us. However, your offers aren't reflecting the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $1,225,000, but this is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer:

* **Establishes a firm boundary:**  By stating this is my final offer, I signal my seriousness and willingness to walk away.
* **Offers a small concession:** The price is slightly lower than my previous offer, showing I'm still negotiating but not budging significantly. 
* **Creates a sense of urgency:** Bob now knows time is limited, and he risks losing the deal entirely."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I still think $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting too close to John's standing offer.  It's clear Bob is trying to get the best possible deal, but he's not increasing his offer significantly enough to justify the risk of continuing the negotiation. Accepting John's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
