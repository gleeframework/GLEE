"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings, especially to someone like you, is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your position, but the value this product represents is substantial. I can move a bit further to $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go.  This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find a price that works for both of us. However, your offers aren't reflecting the true value of this product.  I'm willing to accept $1,225,000, but this is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I still think $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
