"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for 160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 145. However, I'm willing to meet you at 150. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
