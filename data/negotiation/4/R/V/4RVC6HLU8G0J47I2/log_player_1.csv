Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges that Bob values the product higher than you, but it also aims to secure a significant profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  A high opening price sets a strong initial position and allows for more room to negotiate downwards.
* **Fairness:**  While high, the offer is not unreasonable considering Bob's potential value.  This makes it more likely he'll consider it and counter.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing for both parties to reach a mutually beneficial price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** If he rejects the offer, assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* **Be Willing to Compromise:**  While aiming for the highest price, be prepared to compromise if necessary to close the deal.
* **Consider John's Offer:**  Always keep John's $1,000,000 offer in mind as a safety net, but strive for a better outcome with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While it's closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the $1,150,000 offer you initially made. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob has already shown a willingness to pay more than $1,000,000. There's still potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  You can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob completely fall apart.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Consider a price that is higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer, such as $1,100,000. 
* **Be Firm But Flexible:**  It's important to be firm in your stance, but also willing to make concessions to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise between your initial offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. It shows you're willing to negotiate but still aim for a price closer to your desired value.
* **Fairness:**  $1,100,000 is still a good price for both parties. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer and still provides a profit for you. 
* **Signal of Good Faith:**  This counteroffer signals that you're serious about reaching a deal with Bob, but you're not willing to settle for a price that is too low.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  Pay close attention to Bob's reaction. He could accept, counteroffer, or reject.
* **Be Prepared to Negotiate Further:** If Bob counters, you'll need to analyze his offer and determine if you want to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* **Remember John's Offer:** Keep in mind that you can still sell to John for $1,000,000 as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** Bob's offer only increased by $25,000 from the previous round. This shows that he's not willing to move much closer to your desired price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Although John's offer is a safety net, there's still a chance to reach a better price with Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating, potentially securing a higher price. However, there's a risk that Bob might reject future offers or you might end up selling to John at a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** You should make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than your previous offer. Consider a price like $1,090,000.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  Highlight the fact that this offer is a compromise and demonstrates your willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Be Prepared for a Final Decision:**  Consider setting a ""walk away"" price that you won't go below. If Bob rejects your next offer, you'll need to decide whether to sell to John or end negotiations with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Progress:**  The negotiations have reached a stalemate. Bob is only willing to increase his offer by $5,000, which is a very small increment. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a slightly higher price, but it will take more time and effort. 
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a sure deal. It guarantees you a decent profit without further hassle. 

**Conclusion:**

While it's always desirable to get the highest possible price, in this case, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the time, effort, and risk involved. Accepting John's offer is the most pragmatic and efficient decision."
