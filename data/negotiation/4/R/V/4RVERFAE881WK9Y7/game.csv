"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,105,000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us.",1105000.0,Bob,4,
