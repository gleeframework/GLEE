"Alice, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great price for a product worth $9,000 to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about $8,400? It's a fair compromise that allows me to meet my minimum and allows you to get a product worth $9,000 to you. Let's close this deal!",8400.0,Alice,5,
