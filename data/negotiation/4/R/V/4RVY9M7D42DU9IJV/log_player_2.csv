"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great price for a product worth $9,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price point of $8,000. While it's closer to Bob's budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about $8,400? It's a fair compromise that allows me to meet my minimum and allows you to get a product worth $9,000 to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,400 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point of $8,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer and the negotiation could drag on. 

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees Bob gets the product at his desired price without further risk or negotiation."
