"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to accept $12,500 as a final offer? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. Even though you have a slight chance that Alice might accept your counteroffer in the next round, it's not worth the risk. It's better to buy the product from John for $12,000 and avoid further negotiations."
