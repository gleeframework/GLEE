"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be interested in buying the product for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within my budget and a decent price for a product I'm interested in.  Since I'm only willing to pay up to $120, accepting her offer is the best course of action to secure the product and save some money."
