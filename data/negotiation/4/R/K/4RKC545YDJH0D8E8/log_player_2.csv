``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially get a better deal with Alice, or if negotiations fail, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both parties.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation. It's worth attempting a counteroffer to try to get the price down even further before considering buying from John."
