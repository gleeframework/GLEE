"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset that I know will be very beneficial to your business. This price reflects its true worth and offers you a solid return on your investment.  I'm confident that we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to make a significant investment while still ensuring you receive a fair price. Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,
