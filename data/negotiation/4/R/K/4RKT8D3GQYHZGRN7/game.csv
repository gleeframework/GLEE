"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $150 to you. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's start with my offer: $175 for the product.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I recognize the value of your product, $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain profit margin. I am unable to accept $140 for the product. My counteroffer is $160. I hope this aligns better with your budget while allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $160 is still a bit outside my price range. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? This would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
