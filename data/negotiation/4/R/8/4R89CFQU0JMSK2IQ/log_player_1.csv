Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing Bob a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,100,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him dropping his offer closer to John's."
