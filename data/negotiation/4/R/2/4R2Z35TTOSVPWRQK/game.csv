"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I have to say that $7500 is a bit lower than I was expecting. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal for $10000. It's still a great price for this product, and I think it's worth considering. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more compromise.
