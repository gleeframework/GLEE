Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can secure a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for negotiation, as Bob may counter with a lower price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm confident I can get a higher price than his initial offer. 
* **John is still an option:**  Selling to John remains a viable backup if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is my final offer. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the previous offer.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Finality:** I'm stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Highlight:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."

* **John provides certainty:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids any further risk or delay."
