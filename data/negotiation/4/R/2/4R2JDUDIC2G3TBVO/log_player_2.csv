"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further before committing or going with John's offer."
