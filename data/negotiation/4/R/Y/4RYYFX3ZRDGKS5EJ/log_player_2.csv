You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to my target of $1,000,000. This will give Alice room to negotiate while still being beneficial for me. I'll adjust my counteroffers based on Alice's responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing flexibility by coming down from $850,000.  My counteroffer of $725,000 is a smaller step, showing willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. It's a good middle ground for this round of negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $735,000. This is very close to my counteroffer of $725,000, and only $65,000 away from my initial target. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of a deadlock or Alice walking away is increasing. Accepting her offer secures the product for a good price, which is within my budget and significantly cheaper than John's offer."
