"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,225,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm happy to go up to $1,100,000. This price is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
