"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than your $15,000 maximum, you can likely get a better deal. Alice is trying to convince you it's worth $15,000 to you, but you know your own valuation. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $12,000 valuation."
