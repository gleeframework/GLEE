"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential for you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,150,000, reflecting its value and leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think your initial offer is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I still feel  $1,100,000 doesn't fully reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price is still fair and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value and our previous negotiations.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our past discussions.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000 again, and I think this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
