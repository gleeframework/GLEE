Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential for you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,150,000, reflecting its value and leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think your initial offer is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more and there's room for further negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I still feel  $1,100,000 doesn't fully reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price is still fair and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value and our previous negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,075,000, I'm still confident we can get a better price, especially since I'm only a few rounds away from selling to John for $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our past discussions.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000 again, and I think this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

This is getting too close to my minimum price, and we're running out of rounds. I'm going to take the offer from John."
