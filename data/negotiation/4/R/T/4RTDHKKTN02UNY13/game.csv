"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can make a deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
