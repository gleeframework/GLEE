"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially close the deal quickly without going through multiple rounds.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a potential buyer if negotiations with Bob fail. This allows me to be more aggressive in my pricing with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed sale if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Still Too Low:** $10,050 is still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for that amount right now.
* **More Negotiating Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially gain a higher price. 
* **John is a Safe Option:** Knowing that I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,050 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $11,000. How about $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point. This shows I'm open to negotiation but not desperate.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  While I'm willing to lower the price, I'm keeping it above John's offer, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Highlighting the Compromise:**  I emphasize that this price is a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and encouraging him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,200, which is the midpoint between $10,000 and $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Desired Price:** $10,200 is still lower than what I would like to get for the product. Even though we're nearing the midpoint, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet.
* **More Negotiating Room:** I believe there's still room for further negotiation, and I want to try to get closer to my desired price point.
* **John Provides Security:** Having John as a backup allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or simply sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming up with a compromise.  However, $10,200 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Higher Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but counter with a higher price that's still within a reasonable range. 
* **Show Flexibility, But Not Desperation:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not desperate to close the deal at any price.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I emphasize that the price is fair, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and encouraging him to close the deal.
* **Time is Running Out:** This is the fifth round, and it's time to start pushing for a final decision, especially considering John's offer is still on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is a bit closer to the price I'm comfortable with. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in round 6, and the negotiations aren't moving quickly towards a price that is acceptable to me.
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,800 is still too far below my desired price point, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will bring him closer to my expectations.
* **John is a Guaranteed Sale:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's current offer. It's no longer worth risking a lower price for a deal that might not happen.

By selling to John, I can secure a substantial profit and avoid potentially wasting more time on negotiations with Bob that are unlikely to yield a favorable outcome."
