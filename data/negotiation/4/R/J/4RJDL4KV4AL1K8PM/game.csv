"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer on it?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $135. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $125. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value the product offers.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $122.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",122.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $128. This is my final concession, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concessions, but $128 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. This is my final offer.",120.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions already, and I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're at an impasse, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to pay $121 for it. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",121.0,Bob,10,
