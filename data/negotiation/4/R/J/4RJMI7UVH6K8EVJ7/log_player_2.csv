"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and he knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. Offering $10,500 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to Alice. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while also showing Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. Although Alice has lowered her offer to $11,000, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price point but wants to avoid pushing Alice away.  Increasing the offer to $10,750 shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.  It's a reasonable midpoint between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer, making it more likely Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,900. While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a chance Alice will not budge further.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's and saves valuable negotiation rounds.  With only 5 rounds left, it's more strategic to secure the deal at a price that's still beneficial to Bob."
