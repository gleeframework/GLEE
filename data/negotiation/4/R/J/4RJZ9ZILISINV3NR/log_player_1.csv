"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:** 

While $85 is better than selling to John for $80, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $87 is tempting and only $3 away from my bottom line, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $89, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a stalemate with Bob. He's unwilling to budge from his $85 offer, and I'm not willing to drop below $89. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm running out of rounds.  It's best to take the guaranteed $80 from John and avoid risking a further reduction in price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
