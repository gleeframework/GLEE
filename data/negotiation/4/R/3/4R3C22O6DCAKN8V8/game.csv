"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I would be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $12,000? I'm confident that this product will bring you a lot of value, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make it work.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I could go up to $7,000 if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is still a bit above what you initially offered, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring you. Let me know if this works for you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
