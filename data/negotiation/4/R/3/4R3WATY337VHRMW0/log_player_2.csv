"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, you can potentially do better.  You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $125?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not comfortable going that low. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you'd ideally like to pay.  You're still willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price that works for both of you."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $132. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $132, which is only $12 more than her minimum price of $120.  Further negotiation might not yield a significant price reduction, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  Considering your maximum budget is $150, accepting the offer at $132 is the best option to get the product at a decent price without risking missing out."
