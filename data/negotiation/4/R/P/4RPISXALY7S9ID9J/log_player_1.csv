"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it,  which is still a substantial profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm confident I can find a middle ground with Bob without having to settle for his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still looking for a little more.  How about $1,050,000? This reflects the value I know this product holds for you, while still being a significant profit for me.  Let's try to reach an agreement quickly, as we both stand to benefit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This ensures a fair profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,000,000 is a good deal and secures a substantial profit for me.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
