Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and am willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and it's higher than what I could get from John. Accepting his offer is the most profitable choice at this time."
