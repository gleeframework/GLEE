"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000. This price is fair and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this product is valuable and we are getting close to an agreeable price. However, I can't justify going beyond $1,000,000. Would you be willing to accept that?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While your offer of $1,000,000 is close, it's still a bit below what I need to accept.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
