"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,250,000 is higher than Bob's value of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This keeps your options open to sell to John if Bob rejects. 
* **It's a reasonable first offer:**  This allows for some back-and-forth without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and also significantly below your initial offer of $1,250,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's room to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:**  You can always sell to John for a higher price if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to counter Bob's offer with a price that's more favorable to you. You might try something closer to your initial offer, or even a slightly lower counteroffer, as long as it's above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer above minimum:**  $1,100,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring you won't lose out.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  It's a significant reduction from your initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but still a good price point for you. 
* **Space for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this, you can still adjust your offer depending on his counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**  See how Bob responds to your counteroffer. You're still in a strong position, as you can always sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $950,000 is closer to your minimum, but it's still below your initial offer and doesn't reflect the true value of the product.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  You've already shown flexibility, and there's room to counter with a price closer to your desired point.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:**  You can always sell to John for a higher price if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**  Counter Bob's offer with something slightly higher than his proposal, but still below your minimum. This will show you're willing to meet halfway, but not at an unreasonable price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000. This price is fair and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer above minimum:** $1,050,000 is still above your minimum price of $1,500,000, ensuring you won't lose out on the deal.
* **Compromise and flexibility:** This offer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Space for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still adjust your counteroffer in the next round.

**Next Steps:**  Assess Bob's response and be ready to adjust your counteroffer based on his reaction. You are in a strong position, as you can always sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this product is valuable and we are getting close to an agreeable price. However, I can't justify going beyond $1,000,000. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** While $1,000,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price and doesn't reflect the true value of the product.
* **You've shown flexibility:** You've already significantly lowered your initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees you a much higher profit and minimizes your risk.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter with a slightly higher price:** You can try to nudge Bob closer to your minimum by counteroffering with a price slightly above $1,000,000. 
* **Prepare to sell to John:** If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, you should immediately sell to John to secure the higher price and avoid further negotiations.

**Important Note:** You are running out of rounds and have to be more decisive. Selling to John is now the safer option, as you've already shown a willingness to negotiate and are unlikely to get a significantly better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While your offer of $1,000,000 is close, it's still a bit below what I need to accept.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is your last chance to negotiate with Bob. You're showing that you're serious about making a deal, but you're not willing to go below your minimum.
* **Slight Compromise:**  $1,025,000 is just a small step above Bob's last offer, indicating you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on Finality:**  Stating it's your final offer puts pressure on Bob to accept or face losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Prepare for Bob's Decision:** Bob will either accept your final offer or reject it.
* **Sell to John if Rejected:** If Bob rejects your offer, you should immediately sell to John to secure the higher price. You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and further rounds are unlikely to lead to a better deal with Bob."
