"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price and do $8875. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's close this deal!",8875.0,Alice,5,
