"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. It's a unique item that holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. Given its importance, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $9,500. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to both of us. I trust this offer will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the same product from John for $8,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
