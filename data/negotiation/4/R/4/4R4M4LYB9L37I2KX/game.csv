"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for it, considering my budget.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $18,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,000.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price.",15000.0,Bob,4,
