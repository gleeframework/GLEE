"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's in your best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a price closer to my target."
