Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  A starting price of $150 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob hesitates while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the product's value and your willingness to make a deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
