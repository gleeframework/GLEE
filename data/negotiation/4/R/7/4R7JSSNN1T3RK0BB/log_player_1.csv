"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows confidence in the product's value.  I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without risking a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so I'm going to reject his offer. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price well below its worth to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,200. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's a decent compromise and significantly higher than John's offer.  Given the limited rounds, I'm willing to accept this offer and secure the deal."
