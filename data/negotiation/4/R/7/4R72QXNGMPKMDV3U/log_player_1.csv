"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $950,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get more from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for me considering Bob's willingness to pay more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good price, considering we are already in round 4.  I'm willing to accept it and close the deal."
