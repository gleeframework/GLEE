Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's perceived value is $80,  it's best to start negotiations higher than that. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down even slightly.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** Offering it at $140 is a strong tactic. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, but the potential discount might be tempting enough for him to consider it.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that you have John ready to buy at $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  How you proceed depends on Bob's response. He might outright reject $140,  counter with a lower price, or even accept! Be prepared to negotiate."
