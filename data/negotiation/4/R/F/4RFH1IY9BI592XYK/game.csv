"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle on this.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,900, which is a fair compromise. I'm confident you'll find this price very reasonable given the value of the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750, but I was thinking if I could get it for $8,600, I could make the deal work. Can you consider that?",8600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop the price to $8,700.  This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",8700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $8,600, and I'm hoping you can meet me there. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you consider this one last time?",8600.0,Bob,8,
