"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, he can potentially get a better price by negotiating further. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $8,000, so there's room to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to his target, he still has room to negotiate further. He's already shown Alice that he's willing to walk away at $8,500, and he has the option to buy from John for $8,000. There's a good chance he can get a lower price from Alice if he continues negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,250?  This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our positions and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can still potentially negotiate further, he's getting close to his maximum price and there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate as time goes on. He's also getting a good price compared to buying from John, and it's likely he won't get a significantly better offer from Alice in the remaining rounds."
