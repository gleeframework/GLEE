{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's  higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. I want to see if I can get close to the value it holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $110, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to push for more, $95 is a good price and significantly better than selling to John. It's a good compromise and secures a sale, which is important."
