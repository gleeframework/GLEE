"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting price"" implies I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  I'm willing to counter-offer in the hopes of reaching a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $10,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer while still aiming for a price higher than his initial offer. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the ""true value"" to gently nudge Bob towards a higher price point. 
* **Clear Target:** By proposing a specific figure, I'm providing a clear target for Bob to consider in his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I am still working within my budget constraints. Would you consider $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer in very small increments and it seems unlikely he will reach my minimum price of $10,000. I don't want to waste more time negotiating and potentially lose out on John's guaranteed offer. Selling to John ensures I receive my desired minimum price."
