Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her own valuation of the product.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower.  While there are rounds left to negotiate, accepting now guarantees you the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
