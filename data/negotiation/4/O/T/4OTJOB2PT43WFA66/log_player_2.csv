(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept the offer.  $800,000 is a good price, but there's a lot of room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer, significantly below Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see if she's willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but I still think I can get a better price. I'll counter again to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm going to offer a price that's closer to Alice's last offer, but still below it.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating, and hopefully we can reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, she might not come down further.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with her and then having to buy from John at a much higher price.  $725,000 is a good price, and I'm confident I can save money compared to buying from John."
