"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $875,000 is close to my bottom line, I'm still confident that we can negotiate a higher price. There are still a few rounds left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $890,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it would be a great outcome for both sides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
