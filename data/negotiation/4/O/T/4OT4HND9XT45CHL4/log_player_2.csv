"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $110 is lower than John's price of $120, you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice ($80). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt Alice to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John."
