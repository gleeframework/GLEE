Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to start with an offer higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Not Too High:**  We don't want to start ridiculously high (e.g., $20,000) as it might discourage Bob from even considering the offer.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so we don't need to go below that price. 

This strategy aims to find a sweet spot where Bob might accept the offer, netting Alice a higher profit than selling to John. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at her desired minimum price."
