"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  It's always better to try to get a lower price if possible.  We'll start by rejecting and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate seriously. We're aiming for a price that's still attractive to us while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price.  We've already established that we're willing to pay up to $900,000.  Accepting the offer saves us $50,000 and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially reaching the 10-round limit."
