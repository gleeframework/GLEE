"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving you ample room for a significant return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects both the inherent value and the substantial benefits you'll gain from owning it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position and I want to make this deal work. Let's settle this right now - $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth and the value it will bring you.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
