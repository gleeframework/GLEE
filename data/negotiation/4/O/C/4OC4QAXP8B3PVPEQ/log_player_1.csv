Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects both the inherent value and the substantial benefits you'll gain from owning it."",
""product_price"": 1050000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can we discuss a price of $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $975,000 is a significant sum, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to move closer to our desired price range.  We have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? This recognizes the value while acknowledging your budget concerns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no higher. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested but trying to get a bargain.  We're still making progress upwards, and we're not far off from a price we'd be very happy with. We'll push a little further, but need to be mindful of pushing Bob too far."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I want to make this deal work. Let's settle this right now - $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth and the value it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the point where the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation.  Offering a round number like $1,000,000 provides a sense of finality while still being a strong price. It also allows Bob to feel like he's getting a small concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and my previous offer of $980,000. Can we discuss a price of $990,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly still negotiating and willing to move upwards, but the increments are getting smaller. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, accepting his offer of $990,000 is a very good outcome. It exceeds our minimum by a significant margin and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
