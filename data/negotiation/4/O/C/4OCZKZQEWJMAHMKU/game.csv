"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for your budget. However, I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While I believe in the product's value, $16,000 is still a bit beyond my spending limit. Could we agree on $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $14,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm afraid $15,500 is still beyond my budget.  I could offer you $14,500, which I believe is fair given John's offer.  If you can't agree, I'll unfortunately have to go with his offer.",14500.0,Bob,6,
