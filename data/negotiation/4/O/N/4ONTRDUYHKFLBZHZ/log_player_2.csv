"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $11,500. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a valuable item that is worth $12,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, closer to her product's value of $10,000. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John."
