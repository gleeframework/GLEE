"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
