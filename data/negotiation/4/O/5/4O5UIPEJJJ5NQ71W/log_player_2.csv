"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is good, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $7,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,250 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $8,000.  While there's still a chance to negotiate further, accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on."
