"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $7,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,3,
