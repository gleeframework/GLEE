{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she is offering it for $115. This means there is room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get a better price, ideally closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get a good deal, but he doesn't want to be too aggressive and risk losing the sale. Offering $105 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it is closer to Alice's value for the product ($100) and leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above his ideal price. He should continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to his target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  He's offering $108, which is just a little more than Alice's value of $100. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal, but it also leaves room for a small compromise from Alice."
