Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with my own to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1425000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,425,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise that still leaves room for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is still a decent price, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I believe I can get a higher offer from Bob, especially since he clearly values the product at $1,500,000.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,400,000. This offer is closer to Bob's previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer that allows us to potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation has gone on for several rounds and it's clear that we're not going to reach a price that both Bob and I find agreeable. While $1,300,000 is still a decent price, I'm not comfortable continuing this negotiation. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  I can always try negotiating with Bob again in the future if the opportunity arises."
