Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is a fair compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's potential value. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or even losing the sale altogether."
