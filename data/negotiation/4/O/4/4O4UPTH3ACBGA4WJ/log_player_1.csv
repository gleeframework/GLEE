Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:** It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, which you can get from John.
* **Is below Bob's maximum:** It's lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000).
* **Provides room for negotiation:**  It leaves space for both of you to compromise and reach a deal that's mutually beneficial.

By offering this price, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while also ensuring you'll make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's still below the price you would like to achieve.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiations and potentially get closer to your target price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm hoping to get for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $920,000 isn't quite your ideal price, it's only a small distance from your counteroffer of $950,000.  Further negotiation could potentially get you closer to your goal, but it's also possible that Bob won't budge.  Given that you can sell the product to John for $800,000, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this point. You'll secure a significantly higher price than selling to John, and it's a good starting point for future negotiations if you choose to work with Bob again in the future."
