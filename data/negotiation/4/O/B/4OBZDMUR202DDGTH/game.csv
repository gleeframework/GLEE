"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. It's less than what I value the product at.  How about we split the difference and go with $1300000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm still interested in making a deal with you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1250000.  That's getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference again and go with $1275000. This would be a win-win for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1275000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1230000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
