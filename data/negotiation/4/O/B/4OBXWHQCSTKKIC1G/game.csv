"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit further, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise and agree on $8,900. It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $8,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $8,800 is a good offer, and I'm feeling the pressure.  I'm going to go down to $8,850 and see if we can find a solution. It's just a small step, and it means a lot to me.  Let's make this work!",8850.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $8,850 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $8,850. How about $8,825?",8825.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to go down to $8,840. This is as low as I can go, but I really want to make this deal work.  It's been a long negotiation, and I think we're both ready to close this.  What do you say?",8840.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree. I'm going to make one last offer: $8,800. If you can meet me at this price, I'll accept the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8800.0,Bob,10,
