"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $850,000, which is a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
