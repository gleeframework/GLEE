Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However,  $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1000000?  I'm genuinely interested, and I believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another offer. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose $1050000 as a final offer.  This represents a significant reduction from your initial asking price and is the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
