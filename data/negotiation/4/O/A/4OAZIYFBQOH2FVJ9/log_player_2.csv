Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I think I can do better than that. Let's aim for $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

Alice seems anchored to that $800,000 mark and is trying to nudge upwards. We're still in a good position to negotiate further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, it seems like we're both committed to reaching a deal, which is great.  However, to be completely transparent, anything over $770,000 would be pushing my budget.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 770000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to work with me. I'm willing to meet you at $780,000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $770,000. Let's meet in the middle at $785,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

We're getting close, but it's worth pushing a little further. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure to close the deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're really in the home stretch now.  I'm prepared to offer $775,000. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with a decision soon."", ""product_price"": 775000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $790,000, and we've reached a point of diminishing returns. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is not ideal, but it's better than getting stuck in a stalemate with Alice and potentially missing out on the product entirely."
