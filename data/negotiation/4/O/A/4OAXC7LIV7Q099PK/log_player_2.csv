"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I'm confident it's worth at least $120 to me. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to accept $120? "", ""product_price"": 120}
