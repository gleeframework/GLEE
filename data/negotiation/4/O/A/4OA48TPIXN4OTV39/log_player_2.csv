**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is clearly sticking close to her starting price and making very small concessions. We're getting close to the point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better deal than John's offer of $150. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John to ensure we get the product at a reasonable price."
