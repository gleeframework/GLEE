"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and leaves me room for profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $920,000 is a step closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $950,000. How about we settle on $935,000?  It's a good compromise, leaving us both with a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still not comfortable with $935,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer at $915,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",915000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I value your willingness to negotiate.  While $915,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $935,000.  How about $925,000? This price allows both of us to walk away with a fair profit. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,7,
