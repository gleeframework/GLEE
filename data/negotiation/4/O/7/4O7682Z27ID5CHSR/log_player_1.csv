Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you make a profit if he accepts.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept it if it's within my acceptable range or make a counteroffer of my own. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is higher to you, but based on my needs, I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum value of $12,000, but it's still not high enough. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I want to try to get closer to my desired price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.  However, I'll keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9,800? This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am willing to pay $9,600 for it. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial desired price, Bob's offer of $9,600 is only $400 less than my previous counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away or the negotiation dragging on. 

Since John is willing to pay $12,000, accepting Bob's offer still results in a good profit for me.  It's a more conservative choice, but it ensures a sale with minimal risk."
