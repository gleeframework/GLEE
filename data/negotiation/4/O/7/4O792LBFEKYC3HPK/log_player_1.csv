Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm not giving away too much in the first offer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. It's crucial to hold firm on my bottom line. 

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves some room for us to both benefit from this deal.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that is closer to his initial price while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the ""middle ground"" to highlight my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and encouraging. 

This counteroffer aims to maintain my negotiating position while still showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise."
