Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not selling it for less than $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The price is below what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for him to counteroffer if he feels it's too high. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is not the ideal price, it's still above your minimum.  It's better to sell to Bob at this price than risk a counteroffer that could potentially go lower or risk selling to John for $100."
