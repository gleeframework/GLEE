"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is less than what John is selling for, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($120). You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
