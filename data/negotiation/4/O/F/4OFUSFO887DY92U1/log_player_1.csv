"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence about the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the conversation open, inviting Bob to respond and potentially reveal his thinking.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while gathering information about Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to see if I can push the price closer to $2,000,000. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I want to maintain a positive atmosphere and show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Concession:** Dropping $200,000 signals flexibility but keeps the price significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** This tactic aims to make $2,000,000 seem like a reasonable compromise, even though it's still a substantial profit margin for me.

My goal remains to secure a price as close to $2,000,000 as possible before considering other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's well above both my minimum price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), securing a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Pushing further might make him walk away.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations prolongs the uncertainty. Accepting now guarantees a great outcome without risking the deal with John. 

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point.  Accepting $1,900,000 is a smart business decision."
