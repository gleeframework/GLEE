"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
