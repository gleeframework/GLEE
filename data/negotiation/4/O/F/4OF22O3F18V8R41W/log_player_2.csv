"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That product looks great, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're starting with a lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. This gives Alice a chance to counter and keeps us further away from our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we're still above what John is offering. Let's try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and call it $112?"",
""product_price"": 112
}
```

We're proposing a price directly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows Alice we are willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a better deal than John offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $112 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $118. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and at $118, it's a reasonable compromise â€“ better than John's $120 price. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through entirely."
