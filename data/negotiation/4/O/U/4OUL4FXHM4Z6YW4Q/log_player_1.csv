Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has reached a price point where further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting $1,150,000 ensures a substantial profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
