"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 
 
 I'm starting high, at $200, to see if Bob is interested in the product at all.  I'm also emphasizing the product's value to me to create a sense of scarcity.  We'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  $150 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $175?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is getting closer to my desired price. It's still a bit lower than I would ideally like, but with only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $160."
