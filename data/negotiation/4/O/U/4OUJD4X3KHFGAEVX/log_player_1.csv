{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's fair for both of us. It's above my minimum, leaving room for bargaining, but it's also attractive to Bob since it's below his perceived value.  Let's see if we can reach a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent offer, I can still try to get a better price. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. There's a good chance that I can get a better offer from Bob if I continue negotiating. It's a risk, but I believe I can still secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet at $105?  This is a fair compromise, as it's in the middle of our last two offers. It allows me to make some profit while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $92. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my minimum. I've already rejected several offers and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's time to take the deal."
