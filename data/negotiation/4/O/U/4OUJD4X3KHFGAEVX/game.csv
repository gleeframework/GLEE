"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet at $105?  This is a fair compromise, as it's in the middle of our last two offers. It allows me to make some profit while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product.",105.0,Alice,5,
