Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,850,000. This price reflects the unique aspects of the product that bring significant value beyond your initial assessment.

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,850,000 is still too high for Bob. It's worth exploring if Alice will come down further before potentially buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to make a deal here, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This accounts for the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still outside of Bob's budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  It's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget."
