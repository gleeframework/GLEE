* **Limited Time:**  With only 3 rounds left, there is little time to negotiate further. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Purchasing from John guarantees a price of $1,000,000, which is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay.  It's a sure thing, and he's already achieved significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer.  

By buying from John, Bob saves $120,000 compared to Alice's current offer, while still getting the product he wants within his budget."
