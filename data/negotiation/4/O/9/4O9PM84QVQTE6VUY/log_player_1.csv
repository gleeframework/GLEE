Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150 is a starting point.**  It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and uses ""fair"" to position the price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message doesn't make the offer final, allowing for a back-and-forth.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open.  I can always adjust the price based on Bob's response, or move on to John if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Gain leverage:**  By showing I'm not desperate to sell, I might make Bob more eager to meet me halfway.
* **Gather information:**  His counteroffer gives me a better idea of his perceived value for the product.

I will use this information to make a more informed counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I still emphasize ""fair"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Clear message:** I'm communicating my position clearly and concisely, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

By offering $135, I'm trying to find a price point that both Bob and I are likely to find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I still feel there's room for negotiation. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $130, which is only $5 less than my last offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, accepting his offer is the most logical choice at this point. 

Here's why:

* **Close to desired price:**  $130 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer again, he might walk away. There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price in further rounds.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing the negotiation might be time-consuming, and John could make a higher offer in the meantime.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $130 is the best option to secure a good price while minimizing risk."
