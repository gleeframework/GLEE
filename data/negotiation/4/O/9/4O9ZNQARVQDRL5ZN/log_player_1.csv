"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price above Bob's perceived value, but still within a range where he might be willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Positive tone:** I'm starting with a friendly and encouraging message, hoping to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or at least closer to my minimum,  by making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, so there's no need to accept a deal below my minimum right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I can go at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not accepting it completely. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** Offering $11,000 presents a compromise price that is in between our initial positions. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging, hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob with continued negotiation.
* **Selling to John remains a strong option:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, selling to John for my minimum price is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop to $11,250. This is a fair compromise that keeps us both satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway again, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Staying above my Minimum:** $11,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm getting a good deal.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,875? This is a fair compromise that meets us both in the middle. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Not enough rounds left to risk a lower price:** We're at round 6, and I'm not comfortable accepting a price below my minimum with only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Selling to John is a strong backup:**  With limited rounds left, I'm confident that selling to John for my minimum price is a safer and more profitable option than risking a lower deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,125.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can finalize this in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 11125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising while staying above minimum:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise further by dropping the price, but staying above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited time:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to ensure a favorable outcome. 
* **Positive and Motivated:** I'm expressing a desire to finalize the deal in the next few rounds, creating a sense of urgency and a push toward agreement."
