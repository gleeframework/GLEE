"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I can go at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop to $11,250. This is a fair compromise that keeps us both satisfied. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,875? This is a fair compromise that meets us both in the middle. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,125.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can finalize this in the next few rounds.",11125.0,Alice,7,
