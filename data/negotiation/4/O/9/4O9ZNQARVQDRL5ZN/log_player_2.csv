"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I can go at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, he can potentially get it for even less. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and Bob might be able to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and drop to $11,250. This is a fair compromise that keeps us both satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as close to his target of $10,000 as possible. While $11,250 is getting closer, Bob is still within his rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,875? This is a fair compromise that meets us both in the middle. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,125.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. I'm hoping we can finalize this in the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice seems unwilling to budge much further. At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:**  Bob could continue to negotiate with Alice, but there is a risk that they will not reach an agreement.  Alice is now only willing to go down to $11,125, which is still more than Bob wants to pay.  
2. **Buy from John:** Bob knows that he can purchase the product from John for $10,000.  This is the best price he has been offered so far, and it is well within his budget.  

Considering these options, Bob's best course of action is to **buy the product from John**. This will save him money and ensure he gets the product within his budget.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a better price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John."
