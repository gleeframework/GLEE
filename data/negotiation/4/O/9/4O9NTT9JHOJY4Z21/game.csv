"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering what you'll get out of it.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $10,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I've thought it over and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not quite all the way. How about we settle on $9,500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  $9,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $9,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I was thinking we could do a little better than that. How about we meet in the middle again, at $9,250? I think it's a fair price that will make us both happy.",9250.0,Alice,5,
