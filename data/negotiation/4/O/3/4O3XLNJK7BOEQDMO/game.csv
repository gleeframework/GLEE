,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $140? I'm genuinely interested, but I'm on a tight budget.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $160. It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a lot of value from the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  While I appreciate the compromise, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $150? That's my absolute top limit, and I'm confident we can make this work.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $155. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
