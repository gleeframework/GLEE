"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $700,000.  I believe this offer reflects a fair price while acknowledging the value of this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
