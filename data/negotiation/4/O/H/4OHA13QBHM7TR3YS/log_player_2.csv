"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still a significant markup from John's price. It makes sense to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still within our acceptable budget.  Starting low gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is friendly but clearly states we're looking for a lower price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down significantly, we know there's room for a deal. If not, we can adjust our approach in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference at $102.50? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good. However, $102.50 is still a bit too high considering John's price of $100. We have room to push a little further down without losing the opportunity to buy from Alice if she's unwilling to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and her counteroffer. 
* **Staying Firm:** We're still aiming for a price that's a good deal compared to John's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a collaborative tone to keep the negotiation amicable and increase the chances of a successful outcome."
