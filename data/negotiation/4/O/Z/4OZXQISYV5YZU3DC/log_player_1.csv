Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I have more rounds and can explore a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value this product holds."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob and hopefully find a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand your budget is tight, but $7,000 just isn't workable for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable to work with, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $7,750, and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,750 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  Let's try $8,250.  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 8250}
