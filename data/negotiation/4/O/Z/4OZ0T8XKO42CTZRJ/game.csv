"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me your premium product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my maximum spending limit of $1000000. Would it be possible for you to adjust your offer accordingly?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This is my maximum budget for this purchase. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
