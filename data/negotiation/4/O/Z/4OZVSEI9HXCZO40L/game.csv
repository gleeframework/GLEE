"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600,000. Can you consider that?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see the value in this product, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
