"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth exploring those options before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value for the product. This is a strong opening counteroffer that shows I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm confident we can reach a better price through further negotiation.  There's still plenty of room to explore a lower price point, and I have 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $875,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still staying within my budget.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground between Alice's offer and my previous counteroffer, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate further, and I have enough rounds remaining to reach a better deal.  Even though John's offer is always an option, I'm confident I can secure a better price with Alice through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $885,000. I'm trying to find a compromise point between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. It's still within my budget, but it shows I'm willing to move closer to her desired price. 

I believe this is a fair offer considering the remaining rounds and the potential for a better deal with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is back to her initial price, which is not acceptable.  While time is running out, it's still worth trying one more counteroffer. I'm confident that I can reach a better deal than John's offer, especially given Alice's history of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 895000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer one last time to $895,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's still within my budget. It's a final attempt to close the deal with Alice before resorting to John's offer.  

With only 2 rounds remaining, this offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal while still aiming for a price that's favorable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than any previous offer and only one round remains.  There's not enough time to negotiate further, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  Given the risk of being stuck with a price higher than John's, it's more prudent to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.  Although it's not the ideal outcome, it ensures I obtain the product within my budget and avoids any further negotiation."
