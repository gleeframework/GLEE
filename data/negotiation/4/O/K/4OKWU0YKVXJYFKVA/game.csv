"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I think this is a fair price for the product.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $980,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to make one final offer of $1,150,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the same price you offered earlier. I think this is a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
