"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high ($18,000) considering your budget and John's offer. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite & Professional:** Maintains a positive tone for negotiation.
* **Signals Budget:**  $8,000 is a significant drop, suggesting you're serious but have constraints.
* **Leaves Room:**  It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it opens the door for her counter. 
* **John as Leverage:** You have John's $10,000 offer in mind if the gap can't be bridged."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $12,000 is still $2,000 more than John's offer. You have room to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I can offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Acknowledgement:** Recognize Alice's compromise to keep things positive.
* **""Stretch"" Language:**  Instead of outright rejection, ""stretch"" implies it's at your limit.
* **Mentioning Competition:** This doesn't have to be a lie (John's offer exists!). It adds pressure. 
* **Final Offer:** By stating your max, you shift the decision to Alice more firmly. 

Now, it's up to Alice to decide if she'd rather sell for $10,000 or risk losing the sale to John (or continue a potentially lengthy negotiation)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $11,500, which is still above your alternative with John.  At this point, further haggling is unlikely to get you a much better deal from Alice. It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed savings with John's offer."
