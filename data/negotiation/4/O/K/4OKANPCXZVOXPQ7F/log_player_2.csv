"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that I believe is fair considering its value to you.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. What do you think about $1,050,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it might be worth negotiating with Alice, the prompt states that Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's more beneficial for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
