"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully developed and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This represents a fair price considering the potential it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:** Alice is selling the product for $1,150,000, which is cheaper than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so Alice's offer is acceptable.

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and save $50,000."
