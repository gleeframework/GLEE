You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000.  There's a chance you could get a better deal from Alice if you reject her first offer. By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
