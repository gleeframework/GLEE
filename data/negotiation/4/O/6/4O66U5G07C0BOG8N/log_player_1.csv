Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you'd get great value from it. I'm asking for $11,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 and she has a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John, she should aim for a price higher than $12,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $11,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. While it's higher than Bob's perceived value, it might still be enticing if the product offers significant benefits to him.
* **First Refusal Incentive:**  By emphasizing that Bob has the first opportunity, Alice creates a subtle sense of scarcity and potential loss for Bob if he declines."
