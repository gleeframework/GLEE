"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a healthy margin while leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still well above my minimum price, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he sees this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below where I want to be. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  At this point, John is a very real alternative, and I need to see if I can get Bob to meet my price or get closer to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is just above my minimum, and I think it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm also not willing to go much lower.  I'm hoping this is enough to get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is far too low.  He's not showing any signs of being willing to meet me halfway, and we are running out of time.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. It's not the best price, but it's above my minimum and guaranteed."
