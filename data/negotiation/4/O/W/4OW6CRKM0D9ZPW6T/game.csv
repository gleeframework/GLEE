"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $100 to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  It's a great deal for both of us!  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $70? That's a fair offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to go up a bit, how about $75? This is my final offer.",75.0,Bob,6,
