Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I believe it's a great deal and you'll find it very useful."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While I could offer it for $150 and get my minimum, there's a chance Bob values it slightly more than $100. 
* **Strategic pricing:** $149 is just below my guaranteed sale price and appears like a ""deal,"" potentially enticing Bob.
* **Time value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids the potential delay of finding John."
