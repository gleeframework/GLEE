# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I believe it's a great deal and you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $149 is close to your limit, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice or going straight to John."
