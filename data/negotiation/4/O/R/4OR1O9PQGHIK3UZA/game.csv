"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9000 is just too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $10000, but that's my final offer. This price is still a great deal for you considering its value and the savings you'll get compared to buying it elsewhere.  Let's make this happen.  ",10000.0,Alice,5,
