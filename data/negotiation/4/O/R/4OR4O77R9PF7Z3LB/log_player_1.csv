Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a fair starting point as it's halfway between my minimum price of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum price of $80 and ensures I make a profit. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better deal, but it also risks losing the sale altogether."
