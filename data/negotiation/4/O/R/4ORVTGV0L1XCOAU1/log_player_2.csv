"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you, which holds immense value for you at $15,000. I understand its significance and would like to offer it to you at a special price considering your appreciation for its worth. I propose to sell the product to you for $12,000. This offer is exclusive and tailored to recognize your interest and commitment. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than Alice's $8,000 valuation.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and might be able to get Alice to come down further."
