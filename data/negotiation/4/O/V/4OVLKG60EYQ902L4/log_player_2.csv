Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $750,000 is still a significant gap from where I see the product's value.  To be fair to both of us, how about we consider $1,150,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's worth.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  She's consistently come down in increments, and her latest offer is quite close to her bottom line. Rather than risk more rounds and potentially end up paying more than John's price, it's safer to cut negotiations and buy from John now."
