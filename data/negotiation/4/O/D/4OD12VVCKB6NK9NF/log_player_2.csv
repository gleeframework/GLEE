# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This is still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject Alice's offer again. Although it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above your budget. You should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down closer to your target of $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000?  This would allow us to both come away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above your budget.  While you could continue to counteroffer, it's likely that you'll get stuck in a loop of back-and-forth negotiations with little progress.  You've reached a point where it's more beneficial to buy from John for $8,000. You'll save yourself time and frustration, and get the product at a price that's within your budget."
