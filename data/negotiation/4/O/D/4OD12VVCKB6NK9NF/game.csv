"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum value and your desire to sell. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This is still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000?  This would allow us to both come away with a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
