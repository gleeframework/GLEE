"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, $140 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $130?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that price would be fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
