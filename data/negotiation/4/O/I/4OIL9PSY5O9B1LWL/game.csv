"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
