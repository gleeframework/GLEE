Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $8,000 because John provides a guaranteed sale at that price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price of $10,000 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $2,000) while also maximizing your potential profit.  

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Deal:**  The price is enticing enough for Bob to likely accept.
2. **Maximize Profit:**  You're aiming for a $2,000 profit margin, which is significant.
3. **Avoid Risk:** By not being overly greedy (e.g., asking for $11,000), you reduce the chance of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to sell to John at your minimum."
