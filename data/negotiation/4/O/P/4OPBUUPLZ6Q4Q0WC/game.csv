"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. Based on my research and understanding of the product's value, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my initial counteroffer. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see significant value in this product.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,150,000. This acknowledges the product's worth while recognizing your budget considerations.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget with the new price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. My final offer is $1,050,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial price, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $850,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",850000.0,Bob,6,
