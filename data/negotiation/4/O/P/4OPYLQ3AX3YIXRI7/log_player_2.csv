# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.  There's room for negotiation to get a price closer to the middle."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and at $11,500 you're still getting a good deal.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation or paying the full $15,000 to John."
