"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product.  However, I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering your valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
