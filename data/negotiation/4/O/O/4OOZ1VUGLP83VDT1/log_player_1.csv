Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  This is a unique item, and I believe it will bring you a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we can afford to start high. A starting price of $2,250,000 allows significant room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""unique item"" aspects adds perceived value, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording implies a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage rather than walk away immediately.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes we have no prior information about Bob's negotiating style. If we knew he was particularly averse to high starting prices, a different approach might be necessary. 
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, with the guaranteed sale to John, we're not at risk of being left with the product."
