"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15,000 is out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. I'm still only able to offer $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000, which is $12,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
