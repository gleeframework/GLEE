"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
