Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  We've played our hand well, but sometimes the best deals are the ones already available."
