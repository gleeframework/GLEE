I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
