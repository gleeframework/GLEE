,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm really hoping to get closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come up just a bit more to $8,000? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
