Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $12,000 minimum. John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It's time to move on."
