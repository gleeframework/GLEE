"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still too low for me.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to sell too low too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's latest offer, but still keeping it above his value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  It's better than his previous offers, but I'm holding out for a higher price. There are still a few rounds left, so I'm going to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly again, but I'm getting close to my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum value. While I could keep negotiating, the risk of getting stuck with a price I'm unhappy with is increasing.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
