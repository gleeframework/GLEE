I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. However, I'm aware of John's offer of $1,000,000, so I'm willing to negotiate if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm adjusting my price down to $1,350,000, meeting Bob halfway. This is a good compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit, while hopefully convincing Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is still a good profit for me.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid potentially going back and forth further and risk losing the deal altogether."
