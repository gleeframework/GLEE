"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value is worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is a little closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that be possible?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this sale.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
