"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $16,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  Could we meet somewhere around $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $15,500. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  Would you be willing to settle at $14,500?  That's a fair compromise between our positions, I think.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $15,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $14,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14750.0,Alice,7,
