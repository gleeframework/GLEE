{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the product's value and emphasizing the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being too aggressive, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price while remaining open to negotiation and not risking losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it. Here's why:

* **Room for Improvement:** I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Test Bob's Interest:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how serious he is about buying the product and potentially push him to increase his offer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John at $8,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but rejecting Bob's offer allows me to potentially secure a better deal without risking a lower price.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $9,750? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm open to discussing further if needed."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by increasing my offer from $10,000 to $9,750. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and justifying my counteroffer. 
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further but also setting a clear price point.

This counteroffer aims to achieve a balance between securing a higher price and maintaining a constructive dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my desired price range.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I would then be forced to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiating further could drag on, and I'm not sure how much more leverage I have. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good price and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower amount.  It's a good compromise considering the negotiation process."
