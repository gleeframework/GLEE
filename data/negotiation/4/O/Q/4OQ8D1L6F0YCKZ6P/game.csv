"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $135. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider this price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider this price?",115.0,Bob,6,
