Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also positions me to hopefully get a good price.  Since I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, I'm not willing to sell for less than that.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I'm going to try and push for a higher price. I believe the product is worth more than $8,500 to me, so I'll try to get a little closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, but it's still a good amount for me.  If Bob is serious about buying, I think he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm happy to accept Bob's offer. $9,200 is a good price for me, and it's closer to my initial asking price than John's offer. I think it's time to finalize the deal."
