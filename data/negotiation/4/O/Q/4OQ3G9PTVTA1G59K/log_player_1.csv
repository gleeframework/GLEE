Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a steal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and enthusiastic tone to try and pique Bob's interest. 
* **""Steal!"":**  This is a common tactic to make the buyer feel like they're getting a good deal. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. The optimal strategy depends on your assessment of Bob's potential interest and your willingness to risk losing the sale to John.  You could also try a lower starting price or a more neutral tone."
