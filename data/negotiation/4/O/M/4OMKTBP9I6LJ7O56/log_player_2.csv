Alice is getting closer to your upper limit of $120.  While there's a chance you might be able to get a better deal with Alice, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting stuck with a price higher than $120. You're guaranteed to get the product for $120 from John, so it's the safest and most efficient option at this point."
