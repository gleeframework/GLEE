It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. Here's why:

* **Stalled Progress:**  Alice is barely budging on price. The difference between your offers is getting very small, and she's clearly hesitant to go below $11,000.
* **""Extras"" are Unreliable:** The value of the extras Alice is offering is unclear. They could be useful, but they could also be worthless to you. Don't let vague promises sway your decision. 
* **John is the Safe Bet:** You've reached a point where the potential savings from Alice are outweighed by the risk of the negotiation failing. John offers a guaranteed price that keeps you within your budget."
