"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $1800000? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $1700000? It's a small concession, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1700000. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Can you consider that?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
