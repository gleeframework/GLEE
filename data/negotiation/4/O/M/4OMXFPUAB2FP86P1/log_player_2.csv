"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,000,000

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, it's still more than you're willing to pay, especially knowing John will sell it for less. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to buy from John at your target price."
