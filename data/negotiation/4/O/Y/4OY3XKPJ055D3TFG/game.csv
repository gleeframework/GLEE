"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is still a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value the product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",10800.0,Alice,5,
