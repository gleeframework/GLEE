"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth at least $15,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me, implying that this is a good price for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation. 

This approach allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant amount for the product, while also leaving room for negotiation if he's hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $10,000 to me, so I could consider something closer to that range. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum.  

**Strategy:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise. I'll likely aim for something between $13,000 and $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I understand this product has a specific value to you, but it's worth at least $15,000 to me. To find common ground, I'm willing to go down to $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and his perspective on the product's value to him. This builds rapport and shows I'm open to compromise.
* **Reiterating My Value:** I remind Bob of my minimum price point ($15,000), establishing my boundaries.
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:**  I propose $14,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that $14,000 is a good deal for both of us, suggesting that agreeing is in both our interests.
* **Open Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. I hope this shows you I'm serious about buying, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not going to give up my profit margin just yet. John is still a safe bet for my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob by continuing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price between $13,000 and $13,500. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the fact that I'm already willing to compromise, hoping to convince him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a little far off from my desired price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I start by acknowledging Bob's increased offer, showing that I'm taking his efforts seriously.
* **Reiterating My Position:** I remind Bob that I'm still not at my desired price, but I'm willing to compromise.
* **""Meeting Halfway""  Approach:** This phrasing suggests fairness and a willingness to be flexible.  
* **Focusing on Mutual Satisfaction:** I emphasize that $13,000 is a good outcome for both of us, aiming to build consensus.
* **Open-ended Question:** I encourage Bob to respond and keep the conversation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to move up a little more and offer you $12,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum than before, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for less than $13,000 at this point.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, and I want to see if I can push Bob further before going that route.

**Strategy:** I'll make a counteroffer, likely going back to $13,000 or perhaps a slightly lower price.  I'll emphasize that this is my final offer, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I've considered your position, and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it would be a fair outcome for everyone. This is my final offer, as I want to conclude this negotiation and move forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Finality:** I acknowledge Bob's statement that it's his final offer. This shows I'm taking his stance seriously and am ready to potentially end negotiations.
* **Concession, But Not Too Much:** I counter with $13,000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the importance of finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Finality:** I state that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob to accept.
