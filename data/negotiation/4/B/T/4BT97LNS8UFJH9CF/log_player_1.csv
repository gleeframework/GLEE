"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to come up from his perceived value, but I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm still trying to get a price closer to my minimum.  $9,000 is a compromise, but it leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary.  I'm also trying to emphasize the value of the product to Bob in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I place on this product, I would like to propose $8,750 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better price. $8,750 is closer to my minimum, but I think I can push for a little more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm also emphasizing that this is a big compromise. I'm trying to find a price that both of us can agree on before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and I am willing to meet you halfway at $8,875 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,875 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I have a few rounds left, and I'm hoping to get Bob closer to $9,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $8,875 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,125. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while keeping your investment within a reasonable range.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

I'm going to try to close the deal with Bob at $9,125.  This is a decent price for me, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I am willing to pay $8,950 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round before I would have to sell to John.  I'm very close to my minimum price, but Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm going to sell to John for $10,000, which is a much better deal for me."
