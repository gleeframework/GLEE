Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I believe it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you first for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a quick and profitable sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring I get a price significantly above my minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives me leverage. I won't accept any offer from Bob below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent profit, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better price with Bob. I'm not in a rush and losing out on $10  to secure a deal with a potentially higher-paying customer is worth the risk in this scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $112? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 112
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $112, I'm offering a compromise that splits the difference between his last offer ($110) and my previous ask ($115).
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This shows willingness to negotiate but also emphasizes that I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm still above my safety net of $100 (John's offer), allowing me to continue negotiating confidently."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $108 is still a good profit, exceeding my minimum price by $8.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result and could risk losing the sale altogether.  
* **Time Value:** Accepting now allows me to move on and potentially find other buyers for similar products."
