"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,16000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $16,000, and that's as low as I'm comfortable going.",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we try $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $14,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14500.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your patience with me on this. I understand you have a bottom line too.  How about we settle right in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,14000.0
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,250. I can do $14,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,,
