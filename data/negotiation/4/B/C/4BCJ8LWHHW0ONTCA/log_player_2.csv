"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $11,500 isn't a terrible price, you can get the product for $12,000 from John if negotiations with Alice fall through. There's room to negotiate a better price with Alice."
