Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $800,000** (from John's offer). 
* **I'm aiming for a higher price** to maximize my profit.
* **$950,000 is a reasonable starting point** â€“ it's significantly higher than my minimum but not so high that it seems unreasonable.

**Strategy:** 
By starting with a higher price, I can see if Bob is genuinely interested and willing to pay more. If he rejects, I can always come down a little bit, but I want to start strong to see what's possible."
