Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to make the most money possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she needs to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price higher than John's offer.
* **High Anchor:** By starting with a high price, Alice anchors Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if Bob negotiates, he's more likely to stay within a range that is favorable to Alice."
