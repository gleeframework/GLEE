Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,200,000. If you can do that, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While I could push for more, accepting $1,200,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still represents a $200,000 profit over my minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the potential loss of a sale altogether. 
* **Bob's Limit:** His message suggests $1,200,000 is his absolute ceiling, making further concessions from him unlikely."
