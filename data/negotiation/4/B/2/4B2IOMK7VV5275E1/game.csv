"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Given my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a good deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant potential and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
