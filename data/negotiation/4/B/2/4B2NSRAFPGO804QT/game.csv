"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and the value it will bring to your operations.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can go up to $750,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, the gap between our positions remains substantial.  I'm willing to consider $950,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close a deal.  However, I also need to be realistic about the product's value.  Please think carefully about your next move.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit uncomfortable with that number. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,6,
