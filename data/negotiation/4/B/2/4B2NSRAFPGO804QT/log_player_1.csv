"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room to come down during the bargaining process. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" of the product, attempting to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering at $1,100,000 leaves a buffer for negotiation while still staying significantly above Bob's perceived value and close to your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer will give you insight into how eager Bob is to purchase and how far apart your valuations are."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and your initial asking price. While you want to make a deal, accepting such a low offer would mean a substantial loss. It's important to demonstrate that you're willing to negotiate but not at any cost. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and the value it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  You are lowering your price by $100,000 from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Hold Firm:** The counter-offer remains significantly above Bob's initial bid, signaling that you're not willing to drastically devalue the product.
* **Highlight Value:** The message reiterates the product's benefits, aiming to justify the still-high asking price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This round will show whether Bob is genuinely interested in reaching a deal or is firmly set at a much lower price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can go up to $750,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, which shows some willingness to negotiate. However, the increase is relatively small, and the offer remains significantly below your minimum acceptable price. It's time to signal that you're willing to walk away from the deal if a compromise can't be reached. This increases the pressure on Bob and might make him reconsider his position in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, the gap between our positions remains substantial.  I'm willing to consider $950,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close a deal.  However, I also need to be realistic about the product's value.  Please think carefully about your next move."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By presenting this as your ""final offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're serious about walking away if Bob doesn't meet your price.
* **Significant Concession:**  Lowering the price by $50,000 from your previous offer shows flexibility while still staying above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Emphasize Value and Deadline:**  You're reminding Bob about the value while also implicitly introducing the limited rounds as a factor. He might be more inclined to move closer to your price, knowing you have other options. 
* **Shifting the Pressure:** The ball is now firmly in Bob's court. His response will reveal how much he values the product and whether a deal is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit uncomfortable with that number. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Strong Position:** You clearly signaled your willingness to walk away in the previous round. Bob meeting you halfway suggests he's motivated to make a deal.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only a few rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation might not result in a significantly better outcome. Bob could become entrenched in his position, leaving you with the need to accept a lower offer or sell to John at the last minute. 

**Taking this deal now secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation.**"
