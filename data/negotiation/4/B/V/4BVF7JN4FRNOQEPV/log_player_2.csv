"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. I'm not going to disclose the specifics just yet, but I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to let you have it for $1200000.  This is a chance to acquire something truly special.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's.  Since you have no information about the value of the product to Alice, there is no reason to believe that it's worth more than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or explore other options."
