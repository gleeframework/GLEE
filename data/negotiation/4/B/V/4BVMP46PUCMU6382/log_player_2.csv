"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a terrible deal for Bob. $18,000 is significantly over Bob's budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is going to start strong and make a bold counteroffer. He knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John, so he's going to see if Alice is willing to meet that price.  This puts the pressure on Alice, but she might also think Bob is too eager and counter with a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still above Bob's limit. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can still get the product for cheaper."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly. He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's still firmly within his budget. He's hoping this will be enough to persuade Alice to meet him in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's price is still too high for Bob.  It's close to his limit, but Bob wants to see if he can get it for a bit cheaper."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob is going to raise his offer again, but only by a small amount.  He's showing Alice that he's willing to compromise, but he's not going to budge much more.  Hopefully, Alice will see that she's not going to get a much better price, and she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has reached his limit. Alice is not budging much, and there are only a few rounds left. Buying from John is the best option for Bob at this point. He can secure the product for a price he's comfortable with, and he doesn't need to risk further negotiation."
