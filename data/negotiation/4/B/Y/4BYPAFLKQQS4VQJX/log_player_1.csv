Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic. It is:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  You get more than your floor price of $12,000.
* **Lower than Bob's valuation:**  Bob still gets a good deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to him. 
* **Attractive enough to potentially avoid John:** Bob might be more likely to accept than if you had asked for closer to $15,000. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
