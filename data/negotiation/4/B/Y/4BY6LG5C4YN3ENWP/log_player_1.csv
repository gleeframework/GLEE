"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) but lower than the perceived value to Bob ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** A positive message encourages Bob to engage and makes him feel valued. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I've left room to potentially come down in price if Bob makes a counteroffer.  

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, being prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe $12,000 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is Not Ideal:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I want to maximize my potential profit if possible. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $14,000 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $17,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to make Bob feel like he's getting a good value. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my next move, as the rounds are limited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product, I think $13,000 would be a reasonable price for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired $15,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my goal.
* **Selling to John Still Not Ideal:**  While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I want to explore all possibilities before making a final decision.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to my desired $15,000.  I'll need to be strategic with my counteroffer, considering the remaining rounds and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $13,500? That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, showing flexibility.  
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" and ""happy"" to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm emphasizing ""settling"" to make it seem like a final agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider selling to John in the next round. However, I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob and avoid losing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I think $13,000 would be a fair price for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob is not budging from $13,000, and I'm not willing to go below $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We only have four rounds left, and further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my target price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safe bet considering the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than to risk losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $17,000, it's not worth the risk with the limited rounds remaining."
