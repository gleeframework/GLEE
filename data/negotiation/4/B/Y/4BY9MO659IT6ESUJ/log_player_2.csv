"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before and I know you'd put it to good use. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000.  This is a great deal considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
