"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $12,000, I want to start the negotiation significantly lower to give myself room to bargain.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $8,500 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows I'm serious but also expecting Alice to come down from her initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves space for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved a bit, the price is still too high. We are aiming for a price closer to $8,000 and have time to negotiate. I'll counter with a smaller increase to show I'm willing to move but still seeking a more significant discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $8,750?"",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** Increasing my offer by $250 shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to meet her halfway just yet.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm sticking relatively close to my previous offer to signal that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I still have several rounds left, and the option to buy from John gives me leverage. Alice may be more willing to negotiate as we approach the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the price above $9,000.  While she claims this is her lowest, we still have time and room to negotiate further.  I want to push her a bit more before considering an offer in this range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could potentially do $9,000, but that's really pushing my budget."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By offering $9,000, I am making a significant move towards Alice's price. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Setting a Limit:** I'm phrasing this offer as my maximum.  This puts a bit of pressure on Alice, as she might risk losing the deal if she rejects it.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  While unlikely, she could still counter with a price slightly above $9,000, which I would likely accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250 was a bit too high, but I can do $9,125. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $9,125 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and we are already below our maximum budget.
* **Final Offer:**  Alice has signaled that this is her final offer. Rejecting it might lead to her walking away.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk missing out."
