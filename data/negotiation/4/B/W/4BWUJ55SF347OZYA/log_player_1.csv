Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that's incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm setting the price at $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, justifying the high price.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit. However, setting the price too high might make Bob immediately reject the offer. There's always a balance between ambition and the risk of losing a potential buyer."
