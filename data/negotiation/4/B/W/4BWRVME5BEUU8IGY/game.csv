"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a price that works for everyone.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. This offer reflects my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",815000.0,Alice,5,
