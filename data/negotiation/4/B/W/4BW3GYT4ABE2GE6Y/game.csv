"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out!  While I'm interested in the product, $22000 is a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, which is still a good price and a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $22000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $19000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit high, though. I'm willing to go to $17000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",17000.0,Bob,4,
