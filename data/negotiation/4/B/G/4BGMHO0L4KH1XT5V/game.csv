"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, $1,100,000 is considerably higher than I'm willing to pay. I value this product at a maximum of $800,000.  To be fair, I'd be willing to offer $650,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and a mutually beneficial deal.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product, while also allowing me to make a profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. To be completely transparent, I can purchase the product from another seller for $800,000. I'm willing to offer you $725,000 as a show of good faith and my genuine interest in making a deal with you. ",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to show good faith. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. My next counteroffer is $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",875000.0,Alice,5,
