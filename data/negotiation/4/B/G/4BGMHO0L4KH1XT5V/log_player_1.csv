Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, $1,100,000 is considerably higher than I'm willing to pay. I value this product at a maximum of $800,000.  To be fair, I'd be willing to offer $650,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product, while also allowing me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. To be completely transparent, I can purchase the product from another seller for $800,000. I'm willing to offer you $725,000 as a show of good faith and my genuine interest in making a deal with you.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your transparency and willingness to show good faith. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. My next counteroffer is $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
