Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product has a firm minimum value of $1,500,000 for Alice.  This is her ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This is the maximum he'd be willing to pay.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000. This is her safety net.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to sell the product for the highest price Bob is willing to pay without exceeding that amount. Any price above $1,000,000 would lead Bob to reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm proposing a price of $995,000."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Maximizes Profit:** This price is just below Bob's maximum valuation, maximizing the chance of him accepting. 
* **Provides Buffer:** The slightly lower price acts as a buffer, accounting for any potential negotiation or misjudgment of Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Secured Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out; she has John's guaranteed purchase at her minimum acceptable price."
