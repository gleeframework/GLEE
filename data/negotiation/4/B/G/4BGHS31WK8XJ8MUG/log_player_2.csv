"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something valuable at a significant discount. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's important to remember that you can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since she values the product significantly lower than your maximum budget."
