Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $18,000, knowing I have a safety net of John's offer at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using positive language (""amazing product,"" ""very interested"") to make the product sound desirable. 
 
Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I can use this to try and get a better price in the next round. 
* **John's Safety Net:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,000? This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but I'm showing a willingness to compromise. This signals that I'm open to negotiation and increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by stating it's still a good deal for both of us.
* **Moderate Price:**  $15,000 is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, making it a more reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **No need for further negotiation:** There's no point in rejecting his offer and risking a lower price in the next round. 
* **Secure the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees I get my minimum price, which is a good outcome."
