"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,500 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours, and settle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To make this work, I need to be closer to my original price.  Would you consider $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,6,
