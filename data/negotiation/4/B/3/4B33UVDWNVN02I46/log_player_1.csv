"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,500. This is a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also my commitment to getting a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have rounds left and I'm not desperate. I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to drop my price again to $16,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they're still not quite there.  I've already made significant concessions. I don't want to risk running out of rounds and ending up with a price I'm not happy with. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and gives me certainty."
