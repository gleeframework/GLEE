Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price ($150), there's no incentive to offer a lower price to Bob.  You might as well start at the highest point and see if Bob bites. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no issues with potentially losing Bob as a customer if he finds out John bought it for a lower price later."
