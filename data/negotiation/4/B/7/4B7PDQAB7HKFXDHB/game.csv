"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,750 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to explore other options. ",11000.0,Alice,5,
