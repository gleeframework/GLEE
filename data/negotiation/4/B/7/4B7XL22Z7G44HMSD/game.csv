"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair offer that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
