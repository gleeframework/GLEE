{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and is also the price John is willing to pay. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal for me considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of losing the sale to John. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation failing."
