"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000, but recognizing your budget constraints,  I'll come down to $1,060,000. This is my final offer.",1060000.0,Alice,5,
