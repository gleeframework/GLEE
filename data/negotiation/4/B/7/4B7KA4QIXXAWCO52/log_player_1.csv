Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $1,060,000. I can go up to $1,030,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?

While a higher price might be ideal, Bob is unlikely to move much further. Accepting the $1,030,000 offer secures a significant profit above John's standing offer and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation."
