"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can we meet in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than that. How about we try $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. Can we try $95? I really think that's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a great deal for both of us at this price.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not sure if $105 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product, can we meet in the middle at $101.5?",101.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $101.5, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I can do $107, but that's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",107.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to meet me at $101.5, but $107 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $99 for the product, can we meet in the middle at $103?",103.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $103, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. How about we try $108?",108.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $100, Alice. I think we've been negotiating for a while and I've made some concessions. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,10,
