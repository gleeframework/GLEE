Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle on $1,025,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're a tough negotiator, I'll give you that!  Let's wrap this up. What if we split the difference and call it $975,000?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can both move on to other things. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly anchoring on that $975,000-$985,000 range.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, it's getting risky. Accepting at $975,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of her pulling back or the negotiation stalling."
