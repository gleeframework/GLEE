"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a time-sensitive opportunity, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum and even below its true value to him. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle on $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,025,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair price that allows me to benefit from the product while recognizing its true value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but I'm still better off aiming higher. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $985,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 985000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come up a bit to $970,000. I believe this reflects the value I place on the product while acknowledging your position.  Do we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tough one. Bob is getting very close to my minimum, but I think there's still some wiggle room left. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're a tough negotiator, I'll give you that!  Let's wrap this up. What if we split the difference and call it $975,000?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can both move on to other things."",
