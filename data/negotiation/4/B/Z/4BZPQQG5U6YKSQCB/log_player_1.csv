Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $11,500?** This is a starting point that is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving a good margin for me.
* **Why not go higher?** I don't want to risk Bob immediately rejecting the offer and potentially ending the negotiation.
* **Why not go lower?** I need to ensure I get at least a decent profit, and $11,500 is a good compromise between maximizing my earnings and keeping the negotiation alive.

This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially move into a more favorable negotiation if he is willing to pay more. If he rejects, I can always move to John, ensuring a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why reject Bob's offer?**  Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Why not sell to John immediately?**  While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, there's a chance I can get a slightly better price from Bob by continuing the negotiation.
* **Why not accept Bob's offer?**  I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price of $11,500. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am signaling that I am willing to negotiate further and hope that this will encourage Bob to come up with a slightly higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $11,250?** This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible but also that I still value the product at a higher price.
* **Why not go higher?**  I don't want to push Bob away entirely by being too stubborn.
* **Why not go lower?** I'm confident that I can get a better price than $11,000, and $11,250 is still a decent profit for me.

This counteroffer allows me to test Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects again, I'll need to re-evaluate my options and consider selling to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why sell to John?** Bob's latest offer of $10,800 is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs. 
* **Why not continue negotiating?** I've already made concessions, and Bob's counteroffers are becoming less favorable.  There's a high risk that continued negotiation could lead to a lower price or a stalemate, wasting my time and potentially causing me to miss out on John's guaranteed offer.

Selling to John provides me with the highest guaranteed price and ensures a quick and decisive outcome.  While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, John's offer is the best option at this point."
