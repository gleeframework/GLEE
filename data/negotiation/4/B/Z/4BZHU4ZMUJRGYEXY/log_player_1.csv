"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth your while. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" and the potential value for Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I encourage Bob to respond with his thoughts, signaling that I'm open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:** 

* I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer in subsequent rounds. 
* If the negotiations become unproductive or stall, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity for counter-negotiation:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my target.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and maintains my leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I will use the next round to send Bob a counteroffer that is higher than his offer but still lower than my minimum price.
* I'll aim for a price that is closer to $1,000,000, as Bob showed interest at that price point in the first round.
* If Bob continues to reject offers, I will consider selling to John in the later rounds to avoid losing too much time."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Middle ground:**  $950,000 is a fair middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it a more appealing option for both parties.
* **Positive framing:**  I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and emphasize the fairness of the proposed price.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum but still attractive to Bob.
*  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price.
*  If Bob rejects this offer, I will further adjust my strategy based on his next counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation space:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown some flexibility and I have a few rounds left.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting this offer maintains my leverage and shows I'm not pressured to settle for a lower price.

**Strategy:**

* I will send a counteroffer in the next round that is slightly higher than Bob's current offer but still lower than my minimum.
* I'll aim for a price around $930,000-$940,000. 
* If Bob continues to reject my counteroffers, I will seriously consider selling to John in the later rounds to avoid wasting time."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $930,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm flexible but not willing to drop below my desired profit margin.
* **Fairness Focus:** I emphasize a ""fair price"" for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency Implied:** Mentioning ""closing the deal"" subtly adds a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a step closer to my minimum without being too aggressive, potentially leading to a deal in the next round.
*  If Bob rejects this, I will re-evaluate my strategy, considering selling to John if the next rounds don't show a significant shift from Bob.
*  I'll continue to use positive language and focus on mutual benefit in my communication to build rapport with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited rounds:** We are already in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining before I have to make a decision. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage and shows I'm not desperate to close the deal quickly. 

**Strategy:**

* I will send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $925,000. 
* If Bob continues to reject my offers, I will seriously consider selling to John in the remaining rounds to avoid losing too much money. 
* I will need to carefully evaluate the remaining rounds and Bob's willingness to negotiate. If it seems unlikely he will reach my minimum price, selling to John becomes the more viable option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $915,000 just isn't workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my offer again, but only slightly, demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation but also have a firm bottom line.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I reemphasize the ""fair price"" aspect, reminding Bob of the mutual benefits of closing the deal.
* **Urgency and closing:** I use language like ""let's close this"" to subtly push Bob towards accepting and end the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a compromise that allows for a possible agreement while maintaining a price closer to my minimum.
*  I'm monitoring the remaining rounds and gauging Bob's willingness to meet my price.
*  If this offer is rejected, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum price of $1,200,000.
* **No significant progress:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum, and his counteroffers have not shown a willingness to reach a price closer to my target.
* **Risk of losing money:** If I continue to negotiate with Bob, I risk wasting more rounds and ending up with a deal that is far below my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

* Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,200,000, which is significantly better than the deals I've been offered by Bob.
* This decision minimizes risk and ensures I don't lose money due to prolonged negotiations with a hesitant buyer."
