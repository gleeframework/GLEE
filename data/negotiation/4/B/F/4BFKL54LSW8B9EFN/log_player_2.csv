"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After considering your budget, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you taking my budget into consideration. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $7,000? It seems like a reasonable compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's unlikely to go below $8,500.  You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you have a guaranteed better price elsewhere."
