"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After considering your budget, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you taking my budget into consideration. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $7,000? It seems like a reasonable compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
