Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair for both of us.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with an offer below Bob's valuation but well above your minimum leaves room for potential counter-offers while ensuring a significant profit.

This initial offer aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit while leaving space for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he desires the product strongly."
