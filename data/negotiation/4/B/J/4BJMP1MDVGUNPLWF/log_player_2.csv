{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. We believe this is a fair price, and we're confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll reject it.  $1,350,000 is a good deal, and I'm comfortable accepting it rather than risking losing out on the product."
