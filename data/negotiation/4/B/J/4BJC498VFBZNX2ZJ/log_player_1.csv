Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. My initial offer is $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $12,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential to meet a price closer to your desired range."
