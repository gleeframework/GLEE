"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price this early in the negotiation.  I will counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still gives you a good deal. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's getting closer.  Considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with nothing, I'll accept this offer and secure a sale.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
