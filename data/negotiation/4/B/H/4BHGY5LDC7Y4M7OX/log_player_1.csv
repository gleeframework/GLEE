{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's perfect for you. I'm asking $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I consider the product's minimum value ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. I've also made it clear that I'm open to negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay $100 for it. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $110?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This aligns closely with my budget and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he is unwilling to go higher than $100.  I've already rejected his offer twice, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price. Since John is also willing to pay $100, I'll sell the product to him to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick sale."
