"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125 to make this work. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that $80 is quite a bit lower than your initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That seems fair considering John also sells a similar product.",100.0,Bob,4,
