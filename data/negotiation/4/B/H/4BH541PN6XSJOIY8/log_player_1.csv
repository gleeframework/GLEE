Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $125 to make this work. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $80 is quite a bit lower than your initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That seems fair considering John also sells a similar product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal,  Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price and it's a fair deal considering John also sells a similar product. I'll accept Bob's offer."
