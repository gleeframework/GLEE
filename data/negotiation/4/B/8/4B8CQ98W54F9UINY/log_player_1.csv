Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do at the moment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $1,000,000, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so he won't pay more.
* **The ""sweet spot"":**  By offering $900,000, I'm close to my minimum, and Bob still has some room to profit. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $1,000,000 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still secure a good price. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground that maximizes my potential earnings while still giving Bob a good deal."
