"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:**  A $750,000 difference between our starting points gives us enough room for several rounds of negotiations. 
* **Not too aggressive:** This opening offer isn't too aggressive, leaving room for a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $1400000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value of $1,000,000, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  We have 8 rounds left, so I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm hoping to push him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value I know this product holds for your business.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasonable Counter:** This counteroffer is a compromise - it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Again, I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping it will encourage him to see my offer as fair.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message frames the negotiation as finding a solution that benefits both parties, building goodwill. 
* **Room for More Rounds:**  There's still room for negotiations with 7 rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'd like to propose $1550000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Time:** We're in round 4, and it's getting risky to keep pushing for a higher price. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a better one.  
* **Secure the Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing a deal altogether."
