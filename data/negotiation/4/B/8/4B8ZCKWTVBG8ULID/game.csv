"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
