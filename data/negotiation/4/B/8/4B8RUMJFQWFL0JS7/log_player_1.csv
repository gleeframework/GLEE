{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message helps establish rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing specific details. This encourages Bob to consider the product's worth.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer. 
* **If the negotiation stalls:**  I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's interest in the product suggests that there's room for negotiation. He's willing to pay more than his initial offer. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** While I don't want to sell at $12,000, it's a guarantee that I won't walk away empty-handed if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $8,000 is a significant price difference. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is my absolute minimum. Would you be open to considering a price closer to the middle ground, say $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but still maintaining a significant margin.
* **Specific Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a concrete price point ($11,000) to encourage a clear response from Bob.
* **Middle Ground:** The counteroffer aims to find a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's initial offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation constructive.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* **If Bob's counteroffer is too low:**  I'll likely sell to John to avoid taking a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, $9,500 is still below my desired $12,000.  Accepting would mean selling for less than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation room:**  Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than his initial offer, indicating potential for further negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:** Selling to John at $12,000 is a secure option if negotiations with Bob break down.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum but still acknowledging his willingness to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9,500. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $10,250 is the absolute lowest I can go at this point.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to meet Bob halfway, indicating a desire to close the deal. 
* **Specific Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a concrete price point ($10,250) for clarity. This is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly suggesting a sense of urgency with the phrase ""Let's try to close this deal,"" which might encourage Bob to make a final decision.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired range.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll likely sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has refused to budge further, and his latest offer remains below my desired $12,000 minimum.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck in a loop of back-and-forth offers without reaching a satisfactory price.
* **Secure Option:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe and reliable way to ensure I don't lose money and get a fair price for the product.

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to lead to a significantly better offer.  Selling to John guarantees me a reasonable profit, and I can move on without the risk of prolonged negotiations."
