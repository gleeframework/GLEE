"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a figure closer to my initial proposal.  Would you be willing to consider $2,000,000?  I believe this represents a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're serious about this purchase.  To be completely transparent, $1,600,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
