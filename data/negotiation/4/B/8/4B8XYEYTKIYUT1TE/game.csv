"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal on a valuable product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
