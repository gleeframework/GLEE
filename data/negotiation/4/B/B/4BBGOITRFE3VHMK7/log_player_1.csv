I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a more reasonable price."

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering Bob's increasing offers. I'm hoping this offer will finally be accepted."
