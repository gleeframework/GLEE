Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to discuss the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still feel that the price is too high. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market conditions and the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts on this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still a significant amount less than our desired price and the value John places on it. We have room to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now significantly below John's standing offer of $1,500,000. It's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet Alice's desired price point, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. Selling to John ensures Alice receives her minimum acceptable price."
