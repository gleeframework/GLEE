Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting near that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:**  While you want a high price, a slightly lower offer ($1,100,000) provides room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he desires. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
