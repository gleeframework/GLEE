"Alice, your initial price is far beyond my budget.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the potential return on investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I need to be realistic about the product's worth. Would you consider $1,700,000? This would still represent a significant gain for you while recognizing the unique value proposition I'm offering.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,700,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still realize a profit.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
