"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* However, you know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000. This means there's room for negotiation with Alice.
* By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. This might lead Alice to propose a counter-offer closer to her minimum acceptable price ($800,000)."
