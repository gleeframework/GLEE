"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. This is my best offer, but if you decline, I have another buyer who's willing to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, John is offering the same product for a significantly lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves Bob $200,000."
