Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're leaving room for negotiation and making the deal attractive to Bob. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  By showing confidence in your asking price, you set the tone for the negotiation.

You can adjust this offer based on how Bob responds and how confident you feel about getting a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below your ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get closer to your desired price. You can now counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, you've already negotiated down from your initial price of $120 to $105.  While you might prefer to get closer to $110, accepting Bob's offer is a good decision:

* **It's a significant profit:**  $105 is significantly more than selling to John for $80.
* **It avoids further negotiation:**  You risk losing the sale entirely if you reject Bob's offer and keep going back and forth. 
* **It's likely a fair price:** You've reached a price where you are making a profit and Bob is getting a good deal."
