"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining its value, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford right now. Given the value it holds for me, I can go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and lets me make this purchase work within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $13,000? This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my financial limits.",13000.0,Bob,6,
