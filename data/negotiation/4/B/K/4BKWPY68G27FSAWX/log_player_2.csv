"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a better price than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and Bob's maximum price, making further negotiation worthwhile."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see the value of this product to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $950,000. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer. However, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can continue to bargain and attempt to get the price closer to his desired range before potentially resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go below $950,000. Let's try $920,000. It's a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially since John's offer is significantly higher. It's a good compromise for Bob, allowing him to save a considerable amount compared to John's price while still securing the product."
