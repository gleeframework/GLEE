Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This is a strategic offer.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and John's offer.  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and possibly come closer to my desired price.  

Here's why:

* **Bob's Perspective:**  $14,000 is higher than his value, but potentially a good deal if he believes he can negotiate further. He might be willing to pay a little more than $12,000 to get the product.
* **My Perspective:** This offer gives me the best chance of getting the highest possible price while still keeping the option of selling to John.  

Let's see if Bob bites!"
