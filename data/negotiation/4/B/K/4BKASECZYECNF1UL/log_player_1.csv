I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have liked to get a bit closer to $12,000, we're nearing the end of the negotiations and selling to John would yield a lower profit.  It's better to close the deal with Bob at $11,500 than risk losing him entirely and having to settle for $10,000 with John."
