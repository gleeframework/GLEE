"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the value of this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
