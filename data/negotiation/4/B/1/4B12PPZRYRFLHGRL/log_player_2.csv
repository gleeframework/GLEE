"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
 
This is a great starting point for negotiation. Alice's offer is good, but there's room to save money. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $750,000 is a good price for Bob. It's a savings of $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While there might be room for a bit more negotiation, accepting this offer seems like the most sensible choice at this point."
