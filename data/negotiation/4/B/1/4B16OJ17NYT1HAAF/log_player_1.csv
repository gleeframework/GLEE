Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I have a backup option with John, giving me leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his willingness to pay. 
* If the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll switch to John to guarantee my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating potential for a higher price.
* **John as Leverage:** I have John as a backup, so I can afford to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly above his $13,500.  I want to keep the negotiation moving while still staying closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750?  I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By offering $13,750, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** My message remains positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still aware of John's offer, which gives me confidence in my position. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a price closer to my desired goal.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess his willingness to negotiate. If his counteroffers continue to be significantly lower, I'll move to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has stuck to his $13,500 offer, indicating he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing John, who offers a guaranteed higher price.
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired value of $15,000. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential loss of John's offer. It's time to secure the guaranteed value and move on."
