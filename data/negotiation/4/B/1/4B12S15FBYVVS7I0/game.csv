"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and market demand.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $12,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm eager to make a deal, and I think that's a fair price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
