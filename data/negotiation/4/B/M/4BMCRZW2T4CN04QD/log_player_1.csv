Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, creating a potential surplus for negotiation.
* **One-Shot Deal:** Bob has one chance to accept; this simplifies things as he can't counter-offer.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable. Offering a price slightly below his valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is straightforward and highlights the exclusivity of the offer.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""potential value"" subtly reminds Bob of his $1,500,000 valuation.
* **Price Point:** $1,450,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, making it highly likely he'll accept while maximizing your profit.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. You could experiment with slightly different prices within the $1,200,000 to $1,500,000 range to see how it impacts the negotiation outcome in different scenarios."
