```

Explanation: Alice seems to be stuck repeating a pattern and is unlikely to go below $1,020,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees you get the product and avoids potentially losing the deal with Alice entirely in the last round."
