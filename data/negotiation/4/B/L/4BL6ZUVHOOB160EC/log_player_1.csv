Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $2,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the potential of this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and we have room to negotiate. Bob's latest offer indicates he's willing to move closer to my price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,950,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is consistently moving upwards and we are getting close to the point where the difference to John's offer isn't worth the risk of further negotiation. Accepting at $1,925,000 secures a significant profit."
