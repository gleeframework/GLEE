"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you. My asking price is $1000000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a lower price.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is a less desirable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $950,000**, which is closer to your target price of $900,000.
* **Buying from John for $1,200,000 is significantly more expensive**.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation**, and Alice might not come down any more.

While a lower price would be ideal, accepting Alice's offer at $950,000 still saves you a significant amount compared to John's offer and is a reasonable outcome."
