"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product to me is quite high.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $13,250 is better than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a lower price."
