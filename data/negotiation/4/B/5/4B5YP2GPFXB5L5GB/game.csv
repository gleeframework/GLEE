"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While $1,400,000 is a significant investment on your part, the true value of this product and its potential returns warrant a price closer to my initial proposal.  Would you consider $1,550,000? This demonstrates my commitment to finding a fair agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
