"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. This price reflects its value to me, while also leaving room for you to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad to hear that you see the value in the product. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that balances your needs with my requirements.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1100000 is still a stretch for me.  Considering the price I can get from John,  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  While $1050000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to move this product. Let's close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
