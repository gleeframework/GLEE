"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
