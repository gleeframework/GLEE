Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a good price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes the benefits for Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" and ""fantastic product"" aspects. This can increase his interest and make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly stating that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts and inviting him to respond. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. How the negotiation progresses will depend on Bob's response. I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers and the potential risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to his estimated value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I want to try to squeeze more value out of this deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob might walk away completely if I push too hard, but the potential reward of getting closer to my desired price outweighs that risk at this stage.  I can always fall back on John if the negotiations break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is too far below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial offer.
* **Reasoning:**  I explain my rationale for needing to stay above $900,000. This builds trust and transparency.
* **Middle Ground:**  I propose a ""middle ground"" price that suggests fairness and compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""good deal"" to encourage Bob's acceptance.

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he continues to reject my offers, I'll need to weigh the risks of further negotiation against the potential of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I think this is a fair price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's latest counteroffer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing Value:**  There's a strong possibility that if I continue to reject Bob's offers, he might walk away, leaving me with no sale at all.
* **Secure Sale:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price. This is the safest and most financially secure option at this point.

**Conclusion:** While I would have liked to negotiate a higher price with Bob, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John ensures I don't lose out on a valuable sale."
