"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a good price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $700,000 is too far below what I need for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I think this is a fair price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",850000.0,Bob,4,
