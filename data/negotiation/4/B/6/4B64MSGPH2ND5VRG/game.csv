"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway as well. However, I think the product is worth more than $10000 to me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
