"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the suggestion, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to try to get a bit more than $80 from Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
