"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for a product that's worth a lot more. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a little out of my range. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I can offer you $100. This is a fair price considering I'm paying cash. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, as a final offer. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and still allows me to make a profit.  Let me know if this works for you, or we can just move on.",110.0,Alice,5,
