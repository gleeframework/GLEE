# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$175 is well above your $80 budget.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for a product that's worth a lot more. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is better than $175, it's still above your budget. You're still better off trying to negotiate further or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a little out of my range. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I can offer you $100. This is a fair price considering I'm paying cash. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, as a final offer. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and still allows me to make a profit.  Let me know if this works for you, or we can just move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $110 is still above your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will refuse further offers and you'll be stuck with nothing. Buying from John for $80 is the safest and most financially sound option in this situation."
