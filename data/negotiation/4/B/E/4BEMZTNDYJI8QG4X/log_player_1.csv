Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but not so high that it's immediately out of reach for Bob. I want to see if he's interested in paying a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it's appealing enough for him to accept.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a deal, but I'm also prepared to move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  While I'd like to get a little more,  it's time to close the deal!"
