Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,600,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and exclusivity, justifying the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without overthinking. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's potential willingness to pay a premium to secure the product. If he rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum price."
