"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I agree this product is fantastic, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get a quick sale, and I'll get the product at a price I can afford. Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
