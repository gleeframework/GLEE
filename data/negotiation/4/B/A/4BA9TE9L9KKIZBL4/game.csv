"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110? This is a fair price considering the quality of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. This is the highest amount I can reasonably offer given my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price, considering the quality of the product.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both very close to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,5,
