{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows me to potentially earn a higher price than John's offer, while still being attractive to Bob as it's lower than his valuation. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter-offer, and I'm ready to accept if he agrees to this price."
