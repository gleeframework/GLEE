"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it.  However, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $7500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500 to make this deal work. It's still a good price for the product, and I believe we can both be happy with this offer. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8500 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach a deal.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Bob,4,
