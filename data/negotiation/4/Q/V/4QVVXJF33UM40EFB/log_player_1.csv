Round 2

# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, the price you're asking is a little steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
