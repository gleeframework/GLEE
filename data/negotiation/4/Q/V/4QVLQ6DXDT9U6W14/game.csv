"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not sure I can meet you at $12500, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $14000? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to hold firm on this offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $14250? I think this is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you can understand where I'm coming from.",14250.0,Alice,7,
