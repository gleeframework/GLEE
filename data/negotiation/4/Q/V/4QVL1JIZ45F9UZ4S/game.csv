"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To make it more attractive for you, I am now proposing a price of $8,200. This is still above what you're willing to pay, but I hope this revised offer will help us reach an agreement. This offer is valid for the next 3 rounds.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,200 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $7,500? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,4,
