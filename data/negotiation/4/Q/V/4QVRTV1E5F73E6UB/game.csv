,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I can see that you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not exactly in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1600000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already compromised quite a bit, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1500000. I'm starting to think that we're not on the same page. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've compromised a lot, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you can meet me here, I'd be happy to make a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1500000, Bob. I think we've gone back and forth enough. I'm not going to make another concession. If you're not willing to meet me at my minimum price, I'm going to have to explore other options. I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1300000.",1500000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're firm on your price, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1500000. I'm willing to pay $1300000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,10,
