"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price of $100. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or secure a sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $105?  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum goal of $100, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  I also have the option to sell to John for $100, which is a guarantee."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 100}
