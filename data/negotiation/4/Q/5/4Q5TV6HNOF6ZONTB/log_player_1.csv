{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm also willing to negotiate. Offering a price just above Bob's perceived value might make him more likely to accept.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer and my own valuation.  Remember, I always have the option of selling to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not what I want.  I'm going to counteroffer with a slightly higher price, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000 at this point, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This is a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
