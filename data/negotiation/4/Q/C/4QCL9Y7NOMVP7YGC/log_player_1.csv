Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a steal at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $100, it's always best to start negotiations higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for bargaining or a potential ""lucky break"" if Bob accepts.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** The offer of $140 is just below your minimum acceptable price. If Bob accepts, you make a profit. If he rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired price.
* **Creating Urgency:** The phrase ""for a steal"" is a subtle tactic to make Bob think he's getting a limited-time bargain, potentially pushing him towards a quick acceptance."
