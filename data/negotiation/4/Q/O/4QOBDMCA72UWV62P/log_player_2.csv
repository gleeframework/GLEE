"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You definitely want to reject Alice's offer. It's above your target price. You're in a strong position as you can get the product from John for $800,000.  Let's see if you can get Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range where she might be willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for me to make further concessions if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.  While buying from John is a good backup option, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This time, I'm going all in and offering Alice's minimum price.  It's a risky move, but I'm hoping she'll be motivated to close the deal and avoid having to deal with John. If she rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
