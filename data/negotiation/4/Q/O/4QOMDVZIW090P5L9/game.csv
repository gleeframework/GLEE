"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to compromise, how about $1,600,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,600,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still too low. Let's try to find a compromise that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000.  That's a significant move on my part, and shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit low.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that meets both of our needs.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
