Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I could go as high as  $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he is unwilling to meet a price point that even remotely reflects the product's value to you. He's stuck at incremental increases that are insignificant compared to the difference between his offer and your minimum.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum acceptable price. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
