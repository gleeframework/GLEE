"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. Given its immense potential, I'm confident it's worth considerably more, but to kickstart our negotiation, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I could go as high as  $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognize its value to you. However, my initial offer already reflected a significant reduction in its true worth.  Let's find a middle ground - I propose $1,800,000. This acknowledges your interest while reflecting the asset's inherent value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can do $700,000. I need to see some movement from you to make this work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about moving closer. To show my willingness to make a deal, I'll come down to $1,500,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's the lowest I can go. It reflects a fair price considering the true value of what you're acquiring.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer you $750,000. This is my final offer - I need to know if we have a deal or if I need to pursue other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
