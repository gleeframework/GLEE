"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of that, I would like to suggest an alternative pricing option.

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
