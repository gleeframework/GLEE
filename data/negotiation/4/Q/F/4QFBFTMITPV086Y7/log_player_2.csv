Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is the highest I can go at this time. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget than her first offer, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your compromise. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,500 is still beyond my budget.
