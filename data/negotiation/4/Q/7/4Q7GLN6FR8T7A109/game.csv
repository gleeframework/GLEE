"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but could we work something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. How about we compromise at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,000? That's a fair price that's closer to my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
