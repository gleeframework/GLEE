"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm stance. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't gone into specifics.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage to be bolder in my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price that's more beneficial for me. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a noticeable price reduction to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage further.
* **Holding Ground:** While the reduction is substantial, I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. I want to signal that I'm serious about selling, but not desperate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce my position that his offer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is worth a lot, but I still think $1,900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tempting offer as it's now above my minimum acceptable price. However, it's still significantly less than John's offer. I believe there's a chance to negotiate further and secure a better deal from Bob, closer to $1,500,000. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. Would you consider $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:**  Without revealing John's specific offer, I'm subtly indicating that Bob isn't my only option. This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't make a competitive offer.
* **Final Stretch:** I'm aiming for a price that's a strong compromise â€“ significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but also acknowledging his willingness to negotiate by moving closer to my target.
* **Direct Approach:** By being transparent about the other buyer and directly suggesting a price, I'm aiming for a quicker resolution in the next round or two."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counter-offer indicates he's unlikely to meet my target price. He's moved further away from my previous offer, signaling a reluctance to bridge the gap.  At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob carries a higher risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
