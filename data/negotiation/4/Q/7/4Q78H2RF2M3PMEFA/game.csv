"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product is worth a lot, but I still think $1,900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Can we discuss further?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. Would you consider $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
