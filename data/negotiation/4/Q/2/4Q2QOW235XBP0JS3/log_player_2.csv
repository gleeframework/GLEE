"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and it's worth a lot more than I'm asking. How about $11,500?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested,  $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He can continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows him to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit higher than my budget. How about $10,750? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still pushing for a lower price, aiming for a deal that's closer to his ideal price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,750 is close, but I need to get at least $10,900 for this.  It's a steal at that price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is now within Bob's budget of $12,000. While it's not his ideal price, accepting this offer allows him to secure the product and save money compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk that Alice might reject future offers or Bob might run out of rounds.  At this point, it's a good deal for Bob."
