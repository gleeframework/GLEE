"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value it brings.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to propose $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
