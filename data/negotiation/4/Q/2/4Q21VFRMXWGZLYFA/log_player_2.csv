# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think it's worth discussing a price that suits both of us. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $15,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than the price you'd pay John ($15,000), and it's still within your budget ($15,000).  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000."
