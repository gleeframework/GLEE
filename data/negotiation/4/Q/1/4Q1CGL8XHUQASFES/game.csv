"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to settle around there?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $13,000. This is still a competitive price, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13500.0,Alice,7,
