"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your position, but to be honest, $850,000 is pushing my budget. I'm prepared to offer $780,000. I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",825000.0,Alice,7,
