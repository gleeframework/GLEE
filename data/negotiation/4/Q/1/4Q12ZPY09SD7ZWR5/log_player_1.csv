Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, starting at $95 offers him a small discount while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while ensuring you're still in a favorable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate. You know the product is worth significantly more to him ($100). By rejecting his offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more than his initial offer and open the door for a potential counteroffer closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but holds firm on a price point closer to your initial offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By suggesting $90, you're aiming for a compromise that's still significantly above your minimum acceptable price while potentially being attractive enough for Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This keeps the negotiation moving forward while subtly reminding Bob that you have other options (selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $87.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $87.5 is a solid profit, well above your minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob, especially since he's explicitly mentioned his budget.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** While you could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, your time and effort might be better spent on other potential sales.  

By accepting Bob's offer of $87.5, you secure a good deal and avoid the risk of the negotiation stalling or going south."
