"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
