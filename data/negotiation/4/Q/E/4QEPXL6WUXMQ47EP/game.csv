"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that considers its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still a bit outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle - how about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. However, I need to be realistic about the product's value. I can go as low as $875,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.",875000.0,Alice,5,
