"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $15000 to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for a very fair price. I'm asking $12000.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This is a significant savings.
* **It's within your budget.** You're willing to spend up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer is the most rational choice given the information available."
