Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum.  Any deal needs to be mutually beneficial.

**The Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the given valuations, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor with Negotiation Room:**  Start with a high price, even above John's offer, to set an anchor. This leaves room for negotiation.  The goal is to learn more about Bob's needs and potentially find a compromise (like payment terms, add-ons, etc.).

2. **Accept John's Offer:** If maximizing profit with certainty is the priority, sell directly to John.

**Example Offer (Option 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and market potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,700,000.  I'm open to discussing this further to find terms that work for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,700,000 starting point aims to shift Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement, signaling flexibility.

**Important Considerations**

* **Information is Key:** Try to learn more about why Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Are there aspects you haven't considered that could bridge the gap?
* **Don't undervalue:**  Don't get caught up in making a deal with Bob if it means significantly compromising your profit when you have a guaranteed offer from John."
