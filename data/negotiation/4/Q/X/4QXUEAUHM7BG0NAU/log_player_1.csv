Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $10,000 to me, so I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than $9,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to sell to him for $10,000.  It's a fair deal for both of us."
