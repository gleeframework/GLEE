"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm very interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit hesitant to commit to the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer below $14,000. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $13,000?  That's a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it for less.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying the product, and I'd rather explore other options. I'm willing to make one last offer: $13,500 or I'll have to consider selling to John. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,7,
