(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which I think is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
