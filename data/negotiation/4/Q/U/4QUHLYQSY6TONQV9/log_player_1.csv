Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, recognizing its value to you. This offer is at the upper limit of what I can afford, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob seems pretty firm on his $850,000 offer. It's time to try one more tactic to bridge the gap before resorting to John."
