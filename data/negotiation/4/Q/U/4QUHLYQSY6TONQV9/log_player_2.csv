# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience.

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer is still too high. Even though she reduced the price, it's still beyond my budget. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  Let's meet halfway.  How about $1,425,000? This would be a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal, and I believe it represents a fair and reasonable offer.

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay up to $850,000, but  $1,425,000 is beyond my budget.  Instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice, I'll buy the product from John for $800,000."
