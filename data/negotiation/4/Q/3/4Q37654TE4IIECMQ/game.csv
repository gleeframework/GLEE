"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be offering. For this exclusive item, I propose a price of $120. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value you mentioned. Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To continue moving forward, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This offers a compromise between our respective positions while still providing a reasonable profit for me. I hope this suggestion is acceptable and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90 for the product, but that's my absolute limit. I hope you can see the value in coming to an agreement at this price.",90.0,Bob,4,

I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",92.0,Alice,5,
