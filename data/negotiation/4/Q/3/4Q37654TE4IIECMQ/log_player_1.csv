Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value you mentioned. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
