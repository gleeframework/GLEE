"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might be offering. For this exclusive item, I propose a price of $120. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $80.  Alice's initial offer of $120 is too high, so Bob should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value you mentioned. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To continue moving forward, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This offers a compromise between our respective positions while still providing a reasonable profit for me. I hope this suggestion is acceptable and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still above his maximum budget of $80.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can push Alice lower. He can then make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90 for the product, but that's my absolute limit. I hope you can see the value in coming to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. In order to move closer to a resolution, I am willing to consider $92 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Even though they are getting closer, it's likely that they will continue to go back and forth for a few more rounds. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice, especially since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at a much lower price. Bob should take the guaranteed deal and buy from John."
