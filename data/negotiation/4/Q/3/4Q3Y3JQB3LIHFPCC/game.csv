"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $13,500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?  That's a significant price increase from my end, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway between $12,000 and my original offer, and offer it to you for $13,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,7,
