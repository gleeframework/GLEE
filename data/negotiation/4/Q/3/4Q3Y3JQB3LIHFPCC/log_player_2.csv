Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway between $12,000 and my original offer, and offer it to you for $13,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, the price is still significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of the price remaining above your budget, or even missing out on the deal altogether if you can't reach an agreement. Buying from John guarantees you the product at the best possible price for you."
