"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,400,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still higher than I can comfortably afford.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer you $1,150,000. This offer is a fair compromise and would allow you to make a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 remains beyond my budget. I'm committed to purchasing this product, and I believe $1,175,000 is a fair and mutually beneficial price. This offer is closer to your final offer and represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,175,000 is getting close to my target price, but I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,180,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
