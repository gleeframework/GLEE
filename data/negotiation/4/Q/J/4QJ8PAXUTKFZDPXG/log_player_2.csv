# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to get a better price.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price, and even if you can't, you still have the option to buy from John for your maximum budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  If I can't get the price lower, I can still purchase from John for $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. I can still negotiate further, hoping to get a lower price or just buy from John at my maximum budget. It's worth pushing a little more to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above the $1,000,000 I'm willing to pay.  I've already negotiated a few times, and it's unlikely she'll go lower.  To avoid potentially going back and forth indefinitely, I'm going to buy from John.  I know I can get the product for $1,000,000, and it's better to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with rather than risk a prolonged negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
