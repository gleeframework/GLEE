"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to save even more.  Given the product's value to me and your own valuation, I'd be willing to pay $1150000.  This price reflects a fair deal for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
