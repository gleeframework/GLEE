Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit even if Bob manages to negotiate the price down somewhat. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives you leverage.  You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The tone of the message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as a strategic opportunity for Bob."
