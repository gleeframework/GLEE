"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's price of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You can afford it:** You have a budget of $1,500,000, and Alice's offer fits within that budget.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even though Alice's offer is within your budget, you could try to negotiate a lower price.  However, there's no guarantee of success, and rejecting her offer means you'll likely have to pay more to John."
