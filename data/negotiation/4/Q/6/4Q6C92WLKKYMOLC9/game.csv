"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I think we could have a great partnership. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but I need to stay closer to my budget.  How about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $912,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
