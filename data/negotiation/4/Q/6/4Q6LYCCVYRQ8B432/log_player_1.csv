"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good return on my product.  I'm also leaving room for myself to make a counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd be happy to sell to John for $150, I'm not going to give up on getting a better price from Bob just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. This is a good compromise between my initial asking price and his offer. I'm hoping that he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and we're already four rounds into the negotiation.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
