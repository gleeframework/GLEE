"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a strong opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer of $15,000, it's still better than selling to John for the same price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and his offer. I'm hoping to meet him halfway and see if we can come to an agreement."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower. I'm still not happy with $14,000, and I believe I can get a better price if I keep negotiating.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $16,000.  We're getting closer, and I'm hoping this compromise will be acceptable to him. I'm still confident in the value of my product and believe I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a better deal with him.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
