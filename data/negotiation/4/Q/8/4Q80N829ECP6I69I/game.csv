"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8250.0,Alice,5,
