(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $800,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my firm limit and puts pressure on Alice to compromise.  It also positions me to potentially end the negotiation and buy from John if Alice isn't willing to meet my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a lower price.  There's still a chance Alice might come down further, or I might be able to negotiate a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $800,000 to $900,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.  However, it's still within my acceptable range, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go above my $900,000 limit. I want to see if we can meet in the middle.  With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to be cautious about accepting anything too close to my limit, as I might be able to get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount to $925,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. With only four rounds left, I need to find a price that both Alice and I can agree on. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm still slightly above my desired price, with only three rounds remaining, accepting this offer feels like the best course of action. The price is within a reasonable compromise and it's likely that further negotiation will only take us longer and might not result in a significantly lower price. It's better to secure the product now rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
