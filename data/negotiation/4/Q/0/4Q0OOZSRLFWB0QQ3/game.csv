Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.,110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $102.50.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $102.50 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to pay $97.50, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",97.5,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $101.25.",101.25,Alice,7,
