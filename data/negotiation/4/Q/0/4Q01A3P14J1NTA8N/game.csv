"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $15,000.  It's important for me to get a fair price for my product.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",15000.0,Alice,5,
