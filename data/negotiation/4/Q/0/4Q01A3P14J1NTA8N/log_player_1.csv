Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?
