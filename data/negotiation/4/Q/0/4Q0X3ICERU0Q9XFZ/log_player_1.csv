{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a quick sale.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try one last counteroffer before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $98. This is a final offer, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this final offer. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John and get my minimum price."
