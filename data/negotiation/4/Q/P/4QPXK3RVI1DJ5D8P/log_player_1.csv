"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  I think this is a fair price, considering the product is worth less to me than it is to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's going to be a slow climb to reach a price I find acceptable. It's not worth the risk of him not reaching my minimum price, especially when I have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John."
