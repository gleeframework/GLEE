Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum acceptable price but still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value. This increases the chance he'll see it as a good deal and accept.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. However, this strategy balances risk and reward, giving you a good chance of exceeding your minimum sale price."
