"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He's clearly interested and understands the product's value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $7,750. While John offers a guaranteed $8,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob. He's consistently making counteroffers and seems willing to negotiate. I'll counter with a price in between our last offers to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,125?  This would allow me to make a fair profit, and you'd still be getting a great value on the product. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 8125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. To be honest, my absolute limit is $8,000. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 matches John's offer.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's important to consider the time constraint. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a fair profit.  There's no guarantee that I can reach a higher price in the remaining rounds, and I'm also taking the risk of losing the deal entirely."
