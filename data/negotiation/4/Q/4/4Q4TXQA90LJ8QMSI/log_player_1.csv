Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a higher price before resorting to selling to John for the minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm offering $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to accept.  I'm willing to lower the price a little, but I'm still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob has made it clear that he is not willing to pay more than $150.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiations to get a few extra dollars. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit."
