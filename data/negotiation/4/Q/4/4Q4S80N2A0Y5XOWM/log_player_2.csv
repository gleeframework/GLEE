``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.**  Bob can counteroffer at a lower price, potentially saving more money."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.**  Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still a significant amount above his ideal.
* **Further negotiation is possible.**  Bob can counteroffer again, potentially finding a price closer to his target. While there's a risk Alice might walk away, it's worth exploring more negotiation rounds before resorting to John."
