{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation, giving Bob some incentive to accept.  It also sets a clear starting point for the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to push for a higher price, as I'm confident I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us to both benefit from the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer is close to my desired price, and it would be risky to push further. There's a chance he could walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer of $1,200,000.  Accepting his offer secures a good deal, and I can still make a profit."
