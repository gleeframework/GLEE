"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $920,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $710,000?",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $710,000 is cutting it close, but I'm ready to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $815,000? This is my final offer.",815000.0,Alice,5,
