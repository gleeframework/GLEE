Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Addressing Value:**  I'm acknowledging the value of the product to Bob, making it seem like a fair offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation, signaling flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiations stall or I'm not satisfied with the progress, I can always sell to John for $800,000 as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $900,000 is a decent profit, Bob's value for the product is $1,500,000. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to that price. 
* **Staying in the Game:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain the possibility of a higher sale price. 
* **Selling to John is a Last Resort:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed option, I'd rather try to maximize my profit by negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $900,000 and $1,200,000, aiming to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This would still be a significant value to you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price. It's a reasonable middle ground between my original offer and Bob's.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Highlighting the value Bob would still receive helps him see the offer's worth.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls or I'm not satisfied, I'll consider selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $975,000 is significantly closer to my goal of $1,000,000 than my minimum of $800,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll become less willing to negotiate, or I may end up settling for a lower price in subsequent rounds.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate may take more time and effort without a guarantee of a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures a good profit and avoids the potential risks of continued negotiation."
