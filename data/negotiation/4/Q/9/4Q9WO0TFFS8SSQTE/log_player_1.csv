Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to your business."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while leaving him with a $50,000 gain.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique"" nature and ""potential benefits"" adds perceived value, making the price more palatable.
* **Confidence:** You're not desperate, so your message should be confident and assertive.

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation tactics beyond the provided valuations. In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer is always beneficial."
