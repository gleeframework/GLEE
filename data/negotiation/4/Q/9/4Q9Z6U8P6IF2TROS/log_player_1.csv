Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $170 leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, we can always lower the price, moving closer to his valuation while still aiming for a profit above John's offer.
* **Guaranteed Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John. This means any price Bob agrees to above $150 is a win. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob!"
