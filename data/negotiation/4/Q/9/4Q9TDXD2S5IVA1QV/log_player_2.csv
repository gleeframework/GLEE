"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum value but still within your budget. However, you can likely get a better price by negotiating. You are aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you, and I'm open to further negotiation if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,225,000, which is still a good deal for you.  It's lower than John's price and closer to your desired price point.  Further negotiation might get you a lower price, but the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal with a lower risk."
