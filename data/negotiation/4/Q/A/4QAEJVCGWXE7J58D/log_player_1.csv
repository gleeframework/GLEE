Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'm proposing $1,075,000. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our acceptable range, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. We're willing to walk away with $1,000,000 from John, but we can likely get Bob closer to $1,100,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,110,000. I believe this reflects the product's true value and represents a fair deal for both of us."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could likely push for a slightly higher price, Bob is consistently moving towards our acceptable range. Accepting $1,050,000 ensures a profitable deal without risking the deal entirely by pushing Bob too far."
