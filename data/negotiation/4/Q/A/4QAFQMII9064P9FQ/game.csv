"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we bring it down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $650,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite reflect the value I've placed on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, my budget limit is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. If not, I understand, but I'll have to go with another option.",800000.0,Bob,4,
