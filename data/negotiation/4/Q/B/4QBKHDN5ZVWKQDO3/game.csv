"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product, but I'm open to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  This price is still fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm also committed to getting a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price is a good compromise that ensures we both benefit from this deal. Let's close this transaction and move forward.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
