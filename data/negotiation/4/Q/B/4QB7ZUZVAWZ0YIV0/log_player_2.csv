Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.
