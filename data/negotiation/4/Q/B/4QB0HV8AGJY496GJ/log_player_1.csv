Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $120, and I'm willing to let it go for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning your belief in the product's value, you subtly anchor Bob's perception of the price.
* **Direct Approach:**  While we want to encourage Bob to accept, being straightforward about the offer prevents unnecessary back and forth. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  If Bob rejects it, there's still an opportunity to negotiate down towards $120 or accept John's offer as a backup."
