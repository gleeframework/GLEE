"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $10,000. You should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $8,500. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a significant discount from her initial price of $10,000 and is still above my target price of $8,000. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear limit for what I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but still want to save some money. It's a compromise that's closer to Alice's price but still within my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is very close to my target price of $8,000, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  It's unlikely that further negotiation with Alice will bring the price down to my target. Therefore, it's more beneficial to buy from John at $8,000 and save the money."
