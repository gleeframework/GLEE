Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $180, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and even my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of value.
* **Negotiation:**  By mentioning willingness to negotiate, I encourage Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I know John will buy the product for $150, so I have a strong fallback position if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the interaction open and flexible."
