"I understand that $130 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to meet me at $137.50? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $137.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $135. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $138. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",138.0,Alice,5,
