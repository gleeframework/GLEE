"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $17,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **More negotiation room:** I have 8 rounds left, so there's plenty of time to try and reach a more favorable price. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is far too low for this product. To be fair to both of us, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $15,500. This is a significant reduction from my original offer and a price that's still beneficial for me."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget while also highlighting the value of the product.  Offering a ""middle ground"" price shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Significant Reduction:**  I'm emphasizing the price reduction from my initial offer to show flexibility.
* **Benefit for Both Sides:** I'm framing the proposed price as a win-win scenario for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a compromise that reflects both our needs and is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Time Pressure:** We are already in round 4, and time is ticking. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While I'd prefer a higher price, I can always try to get a slightly better deal through future counteroffers if Bob rejects my next offer.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, there's a risk that I'll reach the point where I'd be better off selling to John for $15,000. 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer is a calculated risk. I'm balancing the potential for a slightly higher price against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
