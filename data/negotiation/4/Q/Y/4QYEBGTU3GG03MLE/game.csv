"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, I need to be mindful of the product's value.  Would you consider $11,500? That's a significant compromise on my end.",11500.0,Alice,5,
