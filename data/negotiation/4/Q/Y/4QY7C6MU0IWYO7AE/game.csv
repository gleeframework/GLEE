"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,200,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant concession, and I truly believe this product will be worth that price to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,200,000, so I'll offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
