"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $7,500 is still too far below my minimum, and I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,375. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and it seems like Bob is serious about closing the deal. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer altogether, and with John as a backup, I feel comfortable accepting this offer."
