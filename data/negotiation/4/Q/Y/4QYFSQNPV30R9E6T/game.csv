"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $92.5 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's my final offer. Let's make this deal happen.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $88 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.  Let's make this happen!",90.0,Alice,5,
