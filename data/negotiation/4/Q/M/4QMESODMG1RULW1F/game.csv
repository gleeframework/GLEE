"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my original price. How about $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to get closer to my original price. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1050000, but I'll throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal?",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the additional perks and support, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1020000.0,Bob,8,
