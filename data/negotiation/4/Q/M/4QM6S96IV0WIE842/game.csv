"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product. I'm confident it'll be a great asset to you. My initial offer is $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  How about we start at a lower price point, say $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $650,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite in the range I need to be at.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This allows for a fair margin for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting closer.  How about $725,000? I'm trying to make this work, but I need to stay within a reasonable range.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $735,000. This is a very small margin for me, but I'm committed to making this deal work.  Let's see if we can close this now.",735000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I respect that.  $730,000 is my final offer.  If that works for you, we have a deal.",730000.0,Bob,8,
