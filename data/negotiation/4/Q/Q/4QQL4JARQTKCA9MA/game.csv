"Alice,  $20000 is way out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $8000.  This is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,3,
