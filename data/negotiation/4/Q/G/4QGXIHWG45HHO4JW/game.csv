"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. Considering your willingness to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. Considering your previous offers and the value of the product to you, I'm willing to make a slightly more significant concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the best price I'm willing to offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
