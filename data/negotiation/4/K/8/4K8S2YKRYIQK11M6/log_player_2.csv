"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $950,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your target price of $800,000. There's definitely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** We're starting the negotiation by making a significant counteroffer, immediately demonstrating our desire to pay a lower price. 
* **Fair Justification:** We're acknowledging the product's value but still anchoring the price closer to our desired range. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with a question, inviting Alice to counter and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. While I value your interest,  $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000, reflecting the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to our target, it's still above our desired price point of $800,000.  We're not willing to pay more than that, even considering the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This shows my seriousness in getting this deal done.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:** We're increasing our offer, but only by a smaller amount this time, showing that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:**  We highlight the importance of reaching a ""middle ground"" to encourage Alice to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone reinforces our willingness to negotiate and find a solution."
