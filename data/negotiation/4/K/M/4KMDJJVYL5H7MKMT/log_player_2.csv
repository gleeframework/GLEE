"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $15,000, which is $3,000 more than your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in paying $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $15,000 to $13,500, but it's still over my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000. This price would be fair to both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $13,000, which is closer to my desired price. However, I am still determined to get it for $12,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can convince Alice to meet my price.  It's important to note that if this round fails, I can always buy from John for $12,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm also trying to be fair here. Let's split the difference and agree on $12,500. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,000, which would be $12,750. This is the best I can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. While we've gotten closer, I'm not willing to pay more than my limit.  I've already tried negotiating, and it seems unlikely Alice will go lower.  Since I can buy the product from John for $12,000, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John."
