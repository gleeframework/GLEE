"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find immense value in.  Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000.  I think this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. This product has unique value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,150,000. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,180,000.  This is a very rare opportunity to acquire such a valuable asset.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be closer to my target. I'll counter with $1,120,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1120000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your negotiating style, but stating a 'final offer' at this stage feels premature.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to my price. How about $1,160,000? This reflects the true value of this unique product.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I still think we're a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,140,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1140000.0,Bob,8,
