{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly lower than my initial goal, it's getting close to my minimum and we've only got a few rounds left. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower offer or even a rejection, potentially resulting in me selling to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and maximizes my earnings within the given timeframe."
