"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $160, which is far too much. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $160 is closer to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $130 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $110.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
