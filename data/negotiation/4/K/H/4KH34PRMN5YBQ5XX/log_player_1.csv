Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,100,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for both of us, and lets us both get what we want. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm not going to sell for $1,100,000 when I know it's worth at least $1,200,000 to John.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This price is a fair compromise and ensures a smooth transaction for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen.

While I'm tempted to take $1,150,000, I'm still holding out for a better offer. I know John is willing to pay $1,200,000, and I'm confident I can get closer to that with Bob."
