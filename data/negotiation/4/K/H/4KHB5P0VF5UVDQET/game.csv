"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering the value to me and the market, I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $600,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $650,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value I place on it, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
