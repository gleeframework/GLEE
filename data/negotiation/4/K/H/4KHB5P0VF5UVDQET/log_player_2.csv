"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit steep for me. Considering the value to me and the market, I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $600,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still above my target price. I'm going to continue negotiating and counter with a lower offer to see if we can find a price closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $650,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value I place on it, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $675,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and is clearly approaching her bottom line. It's likely that any further counteroffers will lead to a stalemate or result in me paying the full $1,000,000 to John. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer of $675,000 is the most prudent decision, securing the product while saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
