I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000.  This is the price I would get from John, so I have no incentive to sell to Bob for less.  This leaves the decision entirely in Bob's hands - he can either accept and pay $12,000 for something worth $8,000 to him, or reject and let me sell to John for the full value I need."
