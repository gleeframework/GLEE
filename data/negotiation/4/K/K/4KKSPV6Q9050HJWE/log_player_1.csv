Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the unique benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting with a significantly higher price allows room for negotiation.  
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value and making a counteroffer closer to your desired range more likely.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
