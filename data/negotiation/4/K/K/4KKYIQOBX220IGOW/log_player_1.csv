Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel good about the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $9,000 is my ideal price, I'm willing to negotiate to find a price that works for both of us.
* **John as a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $10,000 ensures I have a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  Accepting it would mean a considerable loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he has expressed interest and a willingness to negotiate.  There's a possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **John as a safety net:** Having John's offer of $10,000 provides a solid safety net if further negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Step:**  I will counter-offer Bob with a price higher than $7,500 but lower than my initial $9,000 offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:**  $8,500 is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By lowering my price, I demonstrate a desire to reach a deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob that even at $8,500, he's getting a great deal on a valuable product. 
* **Closing the deal:**  I use a positive and encouraging tone, suggesting that we can close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $8,000 is less than my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has clearly stated this is his maximum offer.  Any further negotiation is likely to be fruitless.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'd be left with the risk of having to sell to John for $10,000.  
* **Time consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, which might not be worth the potential gain of a few hundred dollars.

**Decision:** Accepting Bob's offer at $8,000 is the most practical and time-efficient choice, considering the risk of losing the deal entirely."
