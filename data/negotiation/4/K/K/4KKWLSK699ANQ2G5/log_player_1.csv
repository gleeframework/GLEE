Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This increases the likelihood of him accepting.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, can be advantageous over waiting for John's guaranteed purchase."
