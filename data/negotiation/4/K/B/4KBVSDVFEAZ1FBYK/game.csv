"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $2000000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but is more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll sell the product to you for $1600000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, just like I offered earlier. I'm hoping we can agree on this price, as it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
