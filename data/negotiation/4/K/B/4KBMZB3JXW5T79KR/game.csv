"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I don't think it's worth more than that to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that to me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1300000 to me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I still think I can do a bit better. Let's try $1280000. I'm willing to compromise, but I want to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1280000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
