"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's value of $8,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise.  It's within Bob's budget and a good price point considering Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting this offer is the best choice at this point, as there's a risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or running out of rounds."
