"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by myself. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I understand its worth to you might be around $120. To ensure both of us benefit from this transaction, I propose we meet halfway. How about offering you the product for $135? This way, you save some money compared to its value to you, and I receive a fair return for my investment. Looking forward to your response!",135.0,Alice,1,
