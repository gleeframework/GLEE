"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This would still allow you to make a significant profit while representing a better price point for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident that this product's true value warrants a higher price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that's more in line with my initial offer.  How about we settle on $875,000? This would still give you a good profit margin while allowing me to secure the product at a price that's within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",875000.0,Bob,4,
