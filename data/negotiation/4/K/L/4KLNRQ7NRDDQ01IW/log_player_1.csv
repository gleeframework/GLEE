Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This would still allow you to make a significant profit while representing a better price point for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that's more in line with my initial offer.  How about we settle on $875,000? This would still give you a good profit margin while allowing me to secure the product at a price that's within my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.
