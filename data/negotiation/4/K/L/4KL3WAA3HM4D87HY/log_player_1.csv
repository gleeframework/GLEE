Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation maximizes the chances of him accepting while securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price. 
* **One Shot:**  Alice only has one chance to make an offer to Bob. Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
