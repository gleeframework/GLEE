"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its field and has tremendous potential for growth. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm offering it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product.  While I recognize its potential, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum investment. I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your latest offer, but still reflects its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a price that we can both live with.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  I hope we can finally reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price that's just $50000 above your latest offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
