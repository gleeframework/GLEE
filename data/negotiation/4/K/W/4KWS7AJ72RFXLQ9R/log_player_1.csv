{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at no less than $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,800,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000. This offer still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1500000.  While it's closer, it's still not within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum price. Accepting this offer is the best option as it allows me to secure the deal without risking further negotiation or potentially losing out to John's offer."
