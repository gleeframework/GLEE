"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to go, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1500000. This offer still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to your target price.  You have 7 rounds left to explore further negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,500,000.  While it's closer, it's still not within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
