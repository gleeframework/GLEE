"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1500000. This offer still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value I place on the product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1500000.  While it's closer, it's still not within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a significant offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
