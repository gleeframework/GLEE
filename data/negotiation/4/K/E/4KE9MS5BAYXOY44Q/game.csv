"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $11,250 to make this work. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",11250.0,Alice,5,
