``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This allows for some negotiation space while still giving me a good starting point. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to make a final counteroffer to see if we can come to an agreement.  If that doesn't work, I'll sell to John."

This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11250}
