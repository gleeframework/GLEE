Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and holds significant value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, you establish a strong negotiating position. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant value"" to justify the high price, without revealing specifics that might weaken your stance. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob is willing to pay a premium if he perceives the value to be high enough. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can potentially still secure a price significantly above $1,000,000."
