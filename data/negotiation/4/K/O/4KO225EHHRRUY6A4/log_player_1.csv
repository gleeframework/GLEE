{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit margin for you.  
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price.

This strategy aims to capture the most value from the buyer who values the product most while having a safety net in place."
