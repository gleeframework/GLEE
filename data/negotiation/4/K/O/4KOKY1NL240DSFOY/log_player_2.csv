"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, but he can potentially save money by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.  Offering $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's original price of $1,200,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate but also shows Bob's seriousness in buying the product at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is still within Bob's budget, it's closer to his maximum than what he would ideally like to pay.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price closer to his initial counteroffer of $1,050,000. There's still room for both parties to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his initial offer of $1,050,000 and Alice's last offer of $1,300,000. Offering $1,150,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer. This counteroffer might be attractive enough for Alice to consider, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is lower, Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob getting stuck at the higher price from John. Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to John, making it the most financially sensible choice at this point."
