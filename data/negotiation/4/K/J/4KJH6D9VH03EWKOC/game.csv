"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $1,400,000 is simply not enough to cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but only to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
