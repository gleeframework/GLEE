"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price. How about we settle around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we agree on $850,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,5,
