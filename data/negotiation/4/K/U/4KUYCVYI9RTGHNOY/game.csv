"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'm able to offer $850,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $900,000.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm committed to finding a fair deal as well. However, $900,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
