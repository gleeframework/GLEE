Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his target. He should counteroffer again, trying to get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm committed to finding a fair deal as well. However, $900,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While $950,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's getting closer to his budget.  Alice has stated this is her final offer, and rejecting it could mean the negotiation drags on further, potentially risking the deal falling through altogether.  It's a calculated risk, but at this point, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option for Bob to secure the product without risking the deal entirely."
