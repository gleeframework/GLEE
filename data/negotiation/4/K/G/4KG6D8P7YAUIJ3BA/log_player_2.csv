"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $900000. I think this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but he can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He has room to negotiate before reaching his maximum price of $1,500,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about $800000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $800,000 is closer to his preferred price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room to potentially get a better deal, and he's already shown willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $800,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount. Let me know if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $700000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $750000? It's a small increase from your offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and $750,000 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000. It's likely that further negotiation will result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice backing out or Bob being forced to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
