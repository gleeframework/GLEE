Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly higher than what John is offering, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate a lower price while still getting a good deal. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit. It also allows for a dynamic negotiation where we can adjust our offers based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm willing to compromise slightly from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while also demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
