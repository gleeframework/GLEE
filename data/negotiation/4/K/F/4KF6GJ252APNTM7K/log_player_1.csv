Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that it's worth $150 to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended and invites Bob to discuss the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $100 is a step in the right direction, I'm looking for something closer to my initial asking price of $120.  Would you be willing to meet me at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a small compromise from my initial $120 offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing the potential savings he'll get even at $110.
* **Direct Counteroffer:**  I'm directly proposing a new price, making it clear where I stand. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure if I can meet you at $110. Would you be willing to go as low as $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $80. This is a relatively small difference.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance Bob will either walk away or refuse to negotiate further, leaving me with no choice but to sell to John for $80. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation could prolong the process and potentially result in a lower final price, or even a breakdown in negotiations. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a relatively good profit.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting $90 is the most practical and financially sound decision in this situation."
