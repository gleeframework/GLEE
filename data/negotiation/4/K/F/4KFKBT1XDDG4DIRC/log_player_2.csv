Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to consider other options, so let me know if this is a deal-breaker for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go lower.  While you could try for another round, there's a real risk she'll walk away, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price.  This offer saves you a significant amount compared to John."
