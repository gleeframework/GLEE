Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlight Value:** Mentioning that the product is worth $150 to Bob emphasizes why he should seriously consider the offer.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price that maximizes your profit, while acknowledging his potential willingness to pay more than your fallback option with John."
