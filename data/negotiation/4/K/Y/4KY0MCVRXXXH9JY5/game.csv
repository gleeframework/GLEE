"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $100 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $92. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like it!",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. It's a fair price that's close to my budget, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $90. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",90.0,Alice,5,
