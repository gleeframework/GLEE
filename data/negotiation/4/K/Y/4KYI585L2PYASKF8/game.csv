"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14000 is a bit above my budget.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $11000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $13000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet at $12000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll consider selling the product to you for $12500. This is still a good deal for me, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your compromise, $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $11500, which is a fair price considering the value to you. This would also allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,
