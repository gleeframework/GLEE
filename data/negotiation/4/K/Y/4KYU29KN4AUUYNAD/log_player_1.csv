Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for something worth so much to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth significantly more to me than to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and encourages him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this product. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk him rejecting my next counteroffer. Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome in this situation."
