{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice's initial offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to immediately establish a price point closer to my maximum budget of $800,000. This will hopefully make Alice realize she needs to be more flexible to reach a deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has reduced her price, but it's still above my budget. I'm going to keep negotiating. It's possible that Alice might be more willing to meet me halfway if I continue to reject her offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise, while still staying within my budget.  It also puts pressure on her to counteroffer more realistically."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still not ideal. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and increases the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly, to $925,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price. It's a middle ground between Alice's offer and my previous offer, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Alice's offer of $940,000 is still too high for my budget.  While I could continue to counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll accept, and we're running out of time.

To avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement, it's more prudent to purchase the product from John at $800,000. This secures the product within my budget and avoids the potential for further negotiation that might not yield a better price."
