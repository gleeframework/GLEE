Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a bit apart on price.

To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,200,000.  However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I think that could be you. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.
