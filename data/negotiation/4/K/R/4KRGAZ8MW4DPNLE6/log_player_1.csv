Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below John's price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the price a bit steep. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering it for significantly less than John's price (e.g., $85) might make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
