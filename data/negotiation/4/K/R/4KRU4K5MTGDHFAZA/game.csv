"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is much lower.  I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $14000? It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and allows you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to think about my minimum profit. How about we meet at $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to go a little higher, but $13000 is still too much for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11500? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I can see that you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $12500? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is a good price for both of us.  It's closer to my budget, and it allows you to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $12200? It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",12200.0,Alice,9,
