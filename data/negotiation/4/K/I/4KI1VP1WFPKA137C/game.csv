"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",14000.0,Bob,4,
