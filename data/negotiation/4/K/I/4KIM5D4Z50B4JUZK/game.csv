"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $850000. I'm willing to go up to $820000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I've already made a significant concession from my initial counteroffer.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $820000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm proposing a price of $880000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $880000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $840000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $800000.",840000.0,Bob,6,
