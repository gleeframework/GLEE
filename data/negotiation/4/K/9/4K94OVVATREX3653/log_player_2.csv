Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're willing to make another concession, but we need to ensure we're not losing too much value. We're willing to offer the product for $11,250. This is our final compromise, and we hope you'll find it reasonable.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price difference is getting smaller. Accepting at $11,250 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000."
