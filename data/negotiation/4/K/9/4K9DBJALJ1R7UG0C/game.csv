"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,450,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,250,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm counteroffering at $1,375,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your eagerness to make a deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
