Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm counteroffering at $1,375,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your eagerness to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000.

It's unlikely we can get a better deal from Alice at this point. Accepting the $1,375,000 offer saves us a significant amount compared to John's price."
