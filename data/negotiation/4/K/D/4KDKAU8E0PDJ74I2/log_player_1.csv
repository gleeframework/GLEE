This offer allows for some room for negotiation while still leaving me with a profit. I've chosen to go slightly higher than the midpoint between our valuations to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial counteroffer, it still falls below my minimum valuation of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is a good offer, it's just a little lower than I can go at this time.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for the value this product offers. "", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $8,500? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still not quite enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my desired range. I believe that there is still room for compromise, and I'm confident that I can get a better price than $8,500."

This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit and you to get a fantastic product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
