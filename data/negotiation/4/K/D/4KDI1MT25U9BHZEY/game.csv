"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $160 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you possibly do $110?  That's a fair price.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $110 really is too low for this product.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I'm getting closer to my limit.  How about $120? That's the absolute highest I can go.",120.0,Bob,6,
