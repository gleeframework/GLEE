"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's a reasonable price for both of us. It's higher than my minimum, but lower than what Bob is willing to pay. This gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I could accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $100, it's still significantly less than my ideal price. Since I have more rounds available, I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $110. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a good price for the product. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for him."
