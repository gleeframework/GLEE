Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,650,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While I've been able to negotiate down, I'm unlikely to get any lower than her current price.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's not worth risking losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can find a similar product with John."
