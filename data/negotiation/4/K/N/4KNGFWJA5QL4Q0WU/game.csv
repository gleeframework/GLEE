"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the substantial benefits it offers.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and returns this product offers. To move forward, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This represents a considerable adjustment on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, we are still pretty far apart. To be frank, I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $700,000 remains significantly below the product's true value.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,500,000? This allows me to acknowledge your constraints while ensuring a fair deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we both value this product, but our ideas of a fair price are still quite far apart. I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer, but $1,500,000 is not feasible for me. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,
