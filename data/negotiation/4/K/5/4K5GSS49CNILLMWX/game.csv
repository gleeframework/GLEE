"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering my budget, how about we aim for $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we aim for $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement closer to $120. I'm sure we can find a fair price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $120 is a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $135? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable price for this unique product.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my offers. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. Based on our discussion, I would like to propose $130 as the final price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",130.0,Bob,8,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to accept $130, but I need to make it worth my while. How about I throw in an additional service or warranty to sweeten the deal? I'll include a 6-month warranty and a personalized setup session, which adds significant value to the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 for the package?",130.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the additional services you're providing. However, based on my budget, I would like to stick to $130 for the product only. I'm not sure if I need the extra services right now, but I'm open to discussing them separately if you'd like. Let me know if we can agree on $130 for the product.",130.0,Bob,10,
