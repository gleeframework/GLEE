"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's value and benefits helps justify the price and gauge Bob's initial reaction.
* **Open Communication:** Encouraging a dialogue helps understand Bob's perspective and willingness to negotiate. 
 
We'll adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,500,000). Accepting this offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. It's worthwhile to counter-offer and explore the possibility of reaching a more favorable agreement. We are still early in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This takes into account your perspective while still reflecting the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):**  We're moving down from our initial offer but still staying well above Bob's lowball offer and our minimum. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  It's essential to keep reminding Bob of the product's inherent value to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  This counter-offer aims to find a compromise that's beneficial for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our absolute minimum price and John's standing offer.  

* **Meeting Our Bottom Line:** While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree. Accepting his offer ensures we achieve our minimum acceptable profit.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Alternative Option:** We already have John as a backup buyer at this price, so there's no advantage to delaying further."
