"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not comfortable at $9,750. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $9,600?",9600.0,Bob,4,
