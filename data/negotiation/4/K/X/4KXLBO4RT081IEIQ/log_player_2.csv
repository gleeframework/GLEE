"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm starting the price at $90.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $90 is higher than our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $75?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $68? That's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 68
}
``` 

We're moving closer to Alice's price, but still aiming for a significant saving. By proposing a middle ground, we signal our willingness to negotiate while staying firm on our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $68 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $72.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $72 is a reasonable price, saving us $8 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
