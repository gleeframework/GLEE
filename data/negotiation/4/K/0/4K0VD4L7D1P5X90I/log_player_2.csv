"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to my maximum price, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring that option before committing to either Alice's offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, leaving room for profit on your end."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to my target price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can reach a price closer to my ideal $850,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal within the remaining rounds and avoid having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $850,000 price. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer to pay $850,000, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  Her latest offer of $880,000 is only $30,000 higher than my target. I'm confident that pushing further might lead to more rounds of negotiation and could ultimately result in me having to buy from John at a much higher price. It's a good deal considering the time spent and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
