,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $110 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
That's closer to what I had in mind.  How about we settle at $125?,125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I need to make a profit, so I can't go any lower than that. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this. I could do $127, that's right in the middle.",127.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit tired of going back and forth, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $132, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",132.0,Alice,7,
