Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit tired of going back and forth, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $132, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is signaling that she's firm on her price. While you could try to negotiate further, you're running the risk of her walking away entirely. Accepting the $132 offer secures you a decent discount and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at full price."
