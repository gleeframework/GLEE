Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Strong But Respectful Language:**  The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive. Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and using phrases like ""I believe a fair price is..."" helps to frame the offer positively. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's unknown how much Bob is willing to pay.  He might try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
