Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $11,000 is still out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $9,250.  Would you be willing to do $10,500? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still above what I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,750?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's unlikely Bob will go above $10,000, and I'd rather secure the sure sale with John at that price than risk further negotiation."
