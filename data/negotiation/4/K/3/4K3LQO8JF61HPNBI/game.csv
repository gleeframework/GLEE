"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $11,000 is still out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident we can make this work.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $9,250.  Would you be willing to do $10,500? This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still above what I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,750?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both meet in the middle.",9750.0,Bob,6,
