This price reflects my desire to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction while also allowing you to appreciate the true worth of the product. Please consider this offer carefully and let me know if you have any questions or would like to proceed with the acquisition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as what John would charge.  There's no benefit to buying from Alice at this price.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the optimal strategy."
