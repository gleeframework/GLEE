"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the true value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to accept $875,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We are still below John's offer and have room to negotiate further. Bob is clearly interested and negotiating towards a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $835,000? This is a very competitive price given the product's potential."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I can go up to $810,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{

While we could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is getting close to John's offer. Accepting $810,000 ensures we make a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing the price in later rounds."
