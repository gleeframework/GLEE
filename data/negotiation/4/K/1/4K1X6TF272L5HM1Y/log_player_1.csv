Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also aware that I can always go to John and get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to try to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for a possible compromise in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as I can't get a better price.  It's time to accept Bob's offer."
