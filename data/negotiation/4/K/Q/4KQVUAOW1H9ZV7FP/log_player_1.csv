"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, just below Bob's perceived value, to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room:**  There's room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still giving me a significant profit. 
* **Avoiding John:**  I don't want to sell to John immediately. I want to explore the potential of a higher offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **I have room to negotiate.** I can counteroffer with a price higher than $7,500, but lower than my initial offer of $9,500.  
* **I want to avoid selling to John if possible.**  A deal with Bob is more profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($7,500). It demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Still Profitable:**  This price is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring a profit for me. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  This counteroffer gives Bob a clear choice â€“ accept and get a decent deal, or risk losing the opportunity to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** There's no significant chance of getting a higher price.
* **Avoid Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations carries the risk that Bob will walk away, or that I might have to lower my price further.
* **Guarantee Profit:** Accepting ensures a profit of $8,000, which is a good outcome."
