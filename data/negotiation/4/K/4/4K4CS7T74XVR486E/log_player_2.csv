"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item at a special introductory price of $1,150,000. This offer is exclusive to you and reflects its immense value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to invest in this product at a slightly lower price point.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To ensure a fair deal for both parties, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a minimum price to reflect the true value of the product. Therefore, I am proposing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a price closer to $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I value your product, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I appreciate your efforts to reach a fair agreement. In light of our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product to you for $1,085,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to come closer to your initial proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,075,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price adjustments. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, well below Bob's initial budget and John's price, while minimizing the risk of further negotiation delays."
