"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me, as I value it at no less than $8,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your position, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value and my own. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my own valuation. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go to $8,750 for the product. This is closer to your price, but still allows me to save some money. Let's try to meet in the middle.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. $8,750 is getting closer, but I need to get at least $8,900 for the product. This is still a very fair deal for you, considering its value. It's only a small difference, let's see if we can close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
