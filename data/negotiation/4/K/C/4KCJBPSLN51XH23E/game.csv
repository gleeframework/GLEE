"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'd like to propose an additional concession: if you're willing to sell it to me for $1,300,000, I'll throw in an extra $10,000 for a total of $1,310,000.
