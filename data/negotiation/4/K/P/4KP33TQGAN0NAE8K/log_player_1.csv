Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At $11,000, Bob's offer is now exceeding his perceived value of the product, signaling a strong desire to purchase. Accepting this offer secures a profit above Bob's initial offer and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by pushing for a higher price.
