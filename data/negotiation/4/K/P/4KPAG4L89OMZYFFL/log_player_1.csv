Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your maximum profit.
* **High but Reasonable:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but it's presented as a ""deal"" to entice him. It acknowledges that you value the product highly but are open to selling it. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
