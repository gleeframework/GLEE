Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. 

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for such a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This offer is just below your guaranteed price from John, leaving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" helps justify the high price.
* **""Fair Offer"":**  Framing it as ""fair"" encourages Bob to engage constructively.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have some flexibility to go lower, but remember your bottom line.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, avoid mentioning him directly. It's better to let Bob think he has a limited-time opportunity."
