"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,350,000 from Alice, which is less than the $1,500,000 from John.
* **It's also better than rejecting the offer.**  Rejecting means you'd still have to buy from John, which is more expensive."
