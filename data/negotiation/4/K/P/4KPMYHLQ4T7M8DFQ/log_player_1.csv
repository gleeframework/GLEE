Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You make a $150,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to the product's value to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $1,150,000, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly too high."
