"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $13,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair to us both, I can't go below $9,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",9000.0,Alice,5,
