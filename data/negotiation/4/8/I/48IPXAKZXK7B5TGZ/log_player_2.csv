"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is cheaper than John's offer, you can likely get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to start a counter-offer process, aiming to get the price closer to your $120 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm interested in your product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $102.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $102.50, which is within my budget of $120 and closer to my ideal price of $95. While I could continue negotiating, there is a chance that Alice will become less willing to negotiate further, or I could end up paying more than $102.50. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product for a fair price without risking a higher price or the potential for the negotiation to break down."
