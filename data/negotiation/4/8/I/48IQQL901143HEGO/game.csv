"Alice, that starting price is quite high. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about we bring it down significantly?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While your initial offer is too low, I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000 to keep the conversation going.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm looking at a budget closer to $700,000 for this product. Would that be something you'd consider?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $950,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budgetary constraints.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's getting closer, but it's still a bit rich for me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours and call it $825,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",825000.0,Bob,6,
