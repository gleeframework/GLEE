"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Projecting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""potential,"" subtly suggesting its value might be even higher than Bob realizes.
* **Leaving John as Leverage:** While I haven't mentioned John explicitly, the possibility of selling to him for my desired price gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is quite high. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about we bring it down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Bob's aggressive lowball suggests he's willing to negotiate. By rejecting, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **John as Leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John for my desired amount.  This gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While your initial offer is too low, I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000 to keep the conversation going."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial price to show flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement. 
* **Holding Above Bob's Value:**  The new price is still above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, giving me room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm not dropping too quickly, demonstrating that I believe in the product's worth and won't settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  To be frank, I'm looking at a budget closer to $700,000 for this product. Would that be something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** While Bob is moving closer to his perceived value, his offer remains below it. Accepting would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting, I'm testing how firm Bob is on his budget. He might be willing to go higher, especially since he expressed a strong interest.
* **John as Safety Net:** The guaranteed offer from John allows me to take calculated risks in my negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $950,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budgetary constraints."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've made a substantial move closer to Bob's range while still staying comfortably above his stated budget and well above my minimum. 
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  The message emphasizes that this price is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and bringing a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a move soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's getting closer, but it's still a bit rich for me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours and call it $825,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** While not my ideal price, $825,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Bob's Upper Limit:** Bob suggesting a split-the-difference approach suggests he's nearing his upper limit. Trying to push further could make him walk away. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner.  Waiting for a potentially better offer from Bob carries the risk of him walking away and me having to accept John's offer anyway."
