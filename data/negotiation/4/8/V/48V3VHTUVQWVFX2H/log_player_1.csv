Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it without feeling pressured.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a significant gap between my offer and Bob's potential value, allowing for a back-and-forth.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  I've made a good profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I may counter with a slightly lower price, or if it's too low, I might choose to sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm aiming to maximize profit, and accepting this offer would mean leaving money on the table. 
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is higher than $850,000 but still lower than my initial offer of $950,000. I'll aim for a compromise that allows for a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects a reasonable compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is a significant step down from my initial offer but still leaves a comfortable profit margin for me. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Middle Ground:**  I'm framing this offer as a ""meeting in the middle"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Keeping the Pressure On:**  I'm not giving up completely and am still pushing for a price closer to my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable deal.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully assess the situation. If he doesn't budge, I might consider selling to John for $800,000 to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a lower price if Bob becomes less willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer secures a good profit with minimal risk. 
* **Time Consideration:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and may not guarantee a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalization:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  This ensures a successful outcome while minimizing the potential for further delays or losses."
