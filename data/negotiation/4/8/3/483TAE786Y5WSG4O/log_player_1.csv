"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected.  This sets the tone for a negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested in buying.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer downward in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired value. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility, I can convince Bob to increase his offer further."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This is my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. I believe Bob is getting closer to my price, and I'm hopeful he'll accept this offer. However, if he rejects it, I'm prepared to move on to John."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we've reached the halfway point in our negotiations. While I'm not averse to continuing, I'm starting to feel like John's offer is more secure.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee my minimum price."
