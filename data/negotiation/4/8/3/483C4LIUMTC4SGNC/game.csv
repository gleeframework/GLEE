"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,750.  This is really the most I can justify spending.  Let me know if it works for you.",12750.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one last push, and I'm thinking $13,200 might be the sweet spot. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's worth it for the right price. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,9,
