"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1200000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,200,000 is the best financial decision."
