"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $120.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $110? It's a great compromise that still gets you a fantastic deal on this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$110 is a good deal. It's still below your maximum price and closer to what you're looking for. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from her altogether."
