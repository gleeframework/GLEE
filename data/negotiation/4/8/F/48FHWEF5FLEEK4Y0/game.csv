"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price that still works for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $135. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we meet at $132? It's a fair price that still gives me a decent profit.",132.0,Alice,5,
