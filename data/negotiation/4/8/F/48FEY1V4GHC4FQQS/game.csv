"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Could we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
