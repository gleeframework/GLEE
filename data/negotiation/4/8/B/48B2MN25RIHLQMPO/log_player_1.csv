"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going too low immediately, as I want to leave space for counteroffers. If Bob accepts, great! If not, we can negotiate further. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $120, so I'm not afraid to walk away from the deal with Bob if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think I can get the product for less elsewhere. I am willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum price of $120, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept right now. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price. 
* **John is a Safety Net:**  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $120, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $90 and my previous offer of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair for both of us, highlighting the benefits of a quick deal. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $95 is still above my minimum price of $120, which means I'm not losing money on this deal. 
* **Building Momentum:**  I hope this counteroffer will push us closer to an agreement. If Bob rejects it, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $90 is a fair price for the product. I hope you can agree to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to My Guns:** Bob is still sticking to $90, and while it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. 
* **No Clear Agreement:**  There's no clear indication that Bob is willing to budge.  I'm not ready to sell for $90 yet.
* **John is Still an Option:**  Remember, I can always sell to John for $120. I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again. I'll need to decide how much I'm willing to drop further while still making a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on $90.  To be honest, that's still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $93, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm dropping the price by $2, showing flexibility. 
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  I'm not willing to go any lower than $93, so this is my last chance to make a deal with Bob. 
* **John is Still an Option:**  If Bob rejects, I'll move on to John and sell for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $91 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $91 is very close to my minimum price of $93. It's getting closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially get a higher price if I continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that John might no longer be available.  
* **Time is of the Essence:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer of $91 is the most sensible decision. It guarantees a sale while still achieving a reasonable profit."
