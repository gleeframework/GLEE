"I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to save a bit on the price. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7500. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7750 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $7750. How about we meet at $8000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
