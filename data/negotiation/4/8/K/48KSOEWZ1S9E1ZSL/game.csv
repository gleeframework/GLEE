"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $140 to make this worthwhile. How about $145? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $145 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $130 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $140? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to keep the product within my desired range.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",135.0,Bob,6,
