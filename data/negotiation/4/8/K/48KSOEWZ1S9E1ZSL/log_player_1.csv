"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $150. I can likely get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $140 to make this worthwhile. How about $145? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $145 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get closer to $150 with further negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $130 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $140? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to keep the product within my desired range."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150.  Since I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, it's more prudent to sell to John for $150 and ensure I get my minimum desired price. There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price."
