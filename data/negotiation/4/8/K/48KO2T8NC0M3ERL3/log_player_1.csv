Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,190,000. I believe it holds significant value that could greatly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,190,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing my profit. 
* **Highlight Value:**  While I don't want to reveal John's offer, I want to emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit while still offering Bob a price that's potentially attractive compared to his perceived value of $800,000."
