(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's much too early to buy from John, and Alice's offer is very good. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is still a good deal for me and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to a price that is within my budget and only slightly higher than my counteroffer. I'm willing to accept this deal, as continuing to negotiate might risk losing the opportunity and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
