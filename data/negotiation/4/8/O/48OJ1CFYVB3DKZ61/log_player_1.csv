I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, while still leaving some room for me to potentially earn more than the minimum value I set for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves me a comfortable profit margin above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise."

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer, and I've already lowered my price significantly.  It's time to move on.  John is offering my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
