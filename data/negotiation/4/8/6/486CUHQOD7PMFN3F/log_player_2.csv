"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  He should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less than that.  How about $13,000? I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still confident that my initial offer of $14,000 is a fair one. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $13,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target.**  $13,500 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will get a better price in the next round. Alice might be firm at $13,500.
* **Time pressure:** While Bob has 10 rounds, it's better to act quickly than risk a drawn-out negotiation.

Bob is better off accepting Alice's offer and saving money rather than risking a higher price or further negotiations."
