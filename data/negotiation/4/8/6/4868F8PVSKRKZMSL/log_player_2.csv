Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and is within Bob's budget. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go lower, considering her minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000.  Therefore, accepting the offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John."
