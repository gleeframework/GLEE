"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a good profit, and since the product is worth $150 to Bob, $120 is a reasonable starting point. 
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not asking for the full $150, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm trying to squeeze every dollar out of him. This helps keep the negotiation open and increases the chances of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for profit:** While $95 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. It's still above my minimum of $80, so there's room to negotiate further.
* **Testing the waters:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm testing his willingness to go higher. He's already shown interest, and I want to see if he's willing to budge closer to my desired price.
* **Staying in control:**  By rejecting his offer, I retain control of the negotiation process. This puts me in a stronger position to potentially secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $105. That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $120 to $105, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that $105 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While lowering my price, I'm not giving in completely. $105 is still well above my minimum price, allowing me to potentially secure a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $105 is closer, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to pay $100, which would be fair for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good profit:** $100 is a good profit for me, considering my minimum price is $80.  
* **Agreement in sight:**  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and this offer is very close to what I'm hoping for. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting this offer could lead to further rounds of negotiation that might not result in a better price, and I risk losing the deal to John.
* **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures a sale and secures a good profit."
