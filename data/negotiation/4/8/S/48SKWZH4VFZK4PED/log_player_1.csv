I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident this offer will pique his interest without being too unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can potentially get more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than what John is offering.  It's not a huge difference, but it's still a profit for me. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
