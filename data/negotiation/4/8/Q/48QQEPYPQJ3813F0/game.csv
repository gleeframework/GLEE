"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you and still fits within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This represents a considerable discount and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,175,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, and to demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm offering a final price of $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer, as it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the product's true value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $1,075,000. This allows us both to walk away with a fair outcome and ensures a smooth transaction. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
