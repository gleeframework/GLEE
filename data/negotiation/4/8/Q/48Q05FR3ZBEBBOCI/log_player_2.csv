"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for $10,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option to buy the product for $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be bluffing about selling to John for $10,000 to pressure you. By rejecting the offer, you can see if she'll come down on the price or if she'll try to negotiate further."
