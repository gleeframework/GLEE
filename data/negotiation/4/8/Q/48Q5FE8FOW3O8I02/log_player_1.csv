Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum, it's still far below the product's true value to Bob, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below the product's true worth.

This price is still fair for both of us, and allows you to benefit from the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John for $1,000,000 yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,250,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take $1,225,000, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'm not willing to sell to John for $1,000,000 yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  We've both shown a willingness to compromise, so I believe we can still reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate. It's also important to note that I've already rejected two of his offers, and he's clearly not willing to go higher.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a significant loss, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
