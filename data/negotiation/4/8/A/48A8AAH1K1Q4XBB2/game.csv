"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is no less than $10000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me is no less than $10000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000. Can we meet at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $10500. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to me is no less than $10000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $11000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000. If you're not willing to meet me at $10000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
