"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
