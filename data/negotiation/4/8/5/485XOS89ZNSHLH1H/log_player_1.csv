{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $800,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has significant value in the product, so there's room for him to counter without you feeling pressured to sell to John. 
* **It shows you're serious:** By starting at a higher price, you demonstrate confidence in the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $800,000, it's significantly lower than your initial offer.  You want to maximize your profit, and selling to Bob at his current offer wouldn't be ideal.  

Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range. This gives you the best chance of securing a better deal without risking selling to John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This still gives you a great price, considering your valuation of the product, and it's fair for me as well. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Appeals to Bob's logic:** Highlighting the value of the product to him and the fair price makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Leaves room for flexibility:**  If Bob counters again, you can adjust slightly without falling too far from your ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your target price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to counter with a more favorable price. You're still in a good position, as Bob clearly values the product and is willing to negotiate. Selling to John at this point would be less profitable, and you haven't exhausted all options with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This would be a fantastic deal for both of us - it gives you a great price for the product, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a compromise approach:**  This counteroffer shows you're flexible and willing to negotiate further.
* **Appeal to logic and fairness:**  By emphasizing the benefits for both parties, you increase the chances of a positive response.
* **Leave room for final negotiation:**  This price is closer to Bob's last offer, making it more likely he'll accept or counter with a slightly higher price. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving in a positive direction while still protecting your interests and maximizing your potential profit."
