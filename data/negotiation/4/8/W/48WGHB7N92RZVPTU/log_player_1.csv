"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to give myself some room for negotiation.  This price is also a good starting point as it's higher than what Bob values the product at, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it. I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum price but still allows room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting that this price is fair to both of us.  I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. There are still plenty of rounds left, and I'm not yet ready to settle for less than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is still a bit low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product to be well worth the value."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a slight compromise here, going down from $140 to $135.  This is just above my minimum and I'm hoping that Bob will accept this final offer. I'm also emphasizing that this price is still fair and that the product is of high quality."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit high for me. How about $132.50? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're approaching the halfway point in our negotiations with Bob and his offers are still below my minimum price point.  I've tried to negotiate with him, but it seems unlikely that he'll reach my desired price. It's time to move on and sell the product to John."
