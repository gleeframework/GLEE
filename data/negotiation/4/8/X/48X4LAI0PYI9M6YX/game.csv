"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about we split the difference at $800,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
