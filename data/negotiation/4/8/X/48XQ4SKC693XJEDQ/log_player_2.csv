"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and values the product significantly less than your maximum price and John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price, saving you even more money."
