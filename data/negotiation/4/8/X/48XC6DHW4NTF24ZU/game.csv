"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
