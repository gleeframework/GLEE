{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum.  This creates space for negotiation, and I'm prepared to go lower, but not below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects the value you'll gain from this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, which is $950,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still well below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for anything significantly less than $1,000,000. I'm confident I can get a better offer, or at least hold firm on my previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm happy to stay at $1,000,000.  This represents a significant discount for you and is a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let's settle at this point."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
