"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, but also demonstrates my confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'll counteroffer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not ready to settle for $11,800. I'll counteroffer again and try to secure a price closer to $12,000.  I have a backup option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $12,200. This shows I'm willing to be flexible, but still maintain a price point above John's offer.  It's a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Bob will be convinced to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and we're reaching a point where the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult.  While I could continue to counteroffer, I believe there's a good chance he'll continue to lower his offer.  With John willing to pay my minimum price, I'll take the guaranteed deal and avoid further risk."
