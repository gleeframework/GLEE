"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  I value this item highly, but I believe its true worth will be realized in your hands.  I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. Given its potential value to you, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price, and I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it holds for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $820,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I'm open to negotiation, but I need to see some movement from your end. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $880,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to propose a price of $780,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",780000.0,Bob,6,
