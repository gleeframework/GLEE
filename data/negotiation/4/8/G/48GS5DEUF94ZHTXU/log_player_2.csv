Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  I value this item highly, but I believe its true worth will be realized in your hands.  I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. Given its potential value to you, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price, and I believe it undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to propose a price of $820,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I'm open to negotiation, but I need to see some movement from your end. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair.
