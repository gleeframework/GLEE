"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in your company.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a little high for my budget. I'm ready to pay $11,250 for the product.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value you're offering, and it's a great deal for me.  Let me know if we can agree on this price.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11,250. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11750.0,Alice,5,
