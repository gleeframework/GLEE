Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to get as close to $150 as possible without risking losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and get a quick sale, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to get a price closer to my desired $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is still a fair price for Bob, given his perceived value of $150, and it's closer to my desired $140. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal $140, it's unlikely he will go any higher. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and a potential drop in price, I'm accepting his offer."
