You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Starting with $950,000 is a bold move, but it signals Bob's serious intent to negotiate and potentially sets a good starting point for a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that's exactly Alice's minimum price. This shows a willingness to compromise and potentially close the deal, while still maintaining a significant savings compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,030,000, which is a good deal for Bob.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a significant savings compared to buying from John, and there's a risk that further negotiation could stall the deal or result in a higher price from Alice. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
