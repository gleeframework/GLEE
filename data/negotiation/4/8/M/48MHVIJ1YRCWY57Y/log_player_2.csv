"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John.  While $12,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $8,000.  John offers a guaranteed price within his budget, making him the better choice."
