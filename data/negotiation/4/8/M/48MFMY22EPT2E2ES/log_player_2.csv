"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $150 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $120. Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Offering $100 leaves room for negotiation and provides a starting point for a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than what he's willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, as he's already invested some time in the process. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since she rejected Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still aiming for a price that is slightly below his maximum. This counteroffer shows that he's serious about buying the product, but is still willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's limit."
