"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits it will bring to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,025,000? This takes into account both our positions and still offers you a significant advantage from its potential.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value I see in the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as it barely covers my own costs and the inherent value of the product. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're at your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $925,000. If you're unable to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing the product from John for $800,000.",925000.0,Bob,6,
