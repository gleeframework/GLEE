"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $10,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still a great deal for both of us.  Would you be interested in buying it for $9,500? It's a fantastic opportunity, but I'm only able to offer this price for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice's offer of $9,500 saves you $500 compared to John's price of $10,000.
* **You value the product at $10,000.**  This means you are willing to pay up to $10,000 for it, so Alice's offer is within your acceptable range."
