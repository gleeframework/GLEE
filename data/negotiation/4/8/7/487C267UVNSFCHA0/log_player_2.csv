"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since you're aiming to save money and the product is worth no more than $10,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer is not a good option. Buying from John for $10,000 is a safer choice, but you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. It's a reasonable starting point for a negotiation, leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's new offer of $11,000 is within your budget and closer to your ideal price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might get firm at this price, and you'd have to settle for John's offer. Accepting Alice's offer minimizes the risk of missing out on a deal altogether."
