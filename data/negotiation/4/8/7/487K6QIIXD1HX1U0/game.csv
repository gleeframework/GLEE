"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects its potential and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Please let me know your thoughts.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
