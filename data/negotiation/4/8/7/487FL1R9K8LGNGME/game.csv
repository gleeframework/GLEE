"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my maximum budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really hoping to stay under $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000?  This would allow us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay under $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
