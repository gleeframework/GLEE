"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $850000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $850000 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
