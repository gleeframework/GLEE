"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This takes into account your value for the product, and still allows me a fair profit. Let's make this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $980000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1020000. That's a significant compromise on my end, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalise this.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
