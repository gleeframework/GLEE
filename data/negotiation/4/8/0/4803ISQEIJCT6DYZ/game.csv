"I appreciate your offer of $125, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. Would $140 be something you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway at $140, and now you're trying to get me to go down to $130. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $137.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",137.5,Alice,5,
