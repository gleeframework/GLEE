Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see how she responds."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,300,000. This is still a significant discount from Alice's offer but closer to a potentially agreeable price."

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay, but we're getting closer.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a price that is reasonable for both of us."

I'm raising my offer to $1,400,000.  This is just $100,000 less than Alice's offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."

Alice's offer is very close to John's price, but it's still $50,000 higher.  To save the extra money, it makes more sense to buy from John at this point."
