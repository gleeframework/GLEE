"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since my goal is to save money, I'll reject the initial offer.  There's no reason to buy from Alice at her starting price when I can get the same product from John. By rejecting, I open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is still below my maximum budget of $150, and it might be attractive enough for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I'd like to get it lower, accepting her offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John. This is a reasonable compromise given the limited rounds and the risk of further negotiation failing."
