"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob isn't willing to pay that much. I'll be watching closely to see how he reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. It's still a good price for me, but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to meet me halfway."
