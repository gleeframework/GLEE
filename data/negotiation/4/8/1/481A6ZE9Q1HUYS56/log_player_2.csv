"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a decent deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $1,100,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price.  If Alice refuses to budge, Bob can then buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's try to close the deal at a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than your latest offer. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'll counteroffer $1,090,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  While Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still slightly more than he wants to pay. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price.  If Alice refuses to budge, Bob can then buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,090,000 is still a bit more than I can justify. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,080,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer $1,095,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's value and the market. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his ideal price, but Alice's final offer of $1,095,000 is still too high.  With only a few rounds left, Bob has to consider the risk of further negotiation.  If Alice rejects his counteroffer again, he might be left with an even worse deal.

Given that John is offering the product for $1,000,000, the safer option is to buy from John. This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
