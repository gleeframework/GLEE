We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still too low. We're aiming for at least $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can nudge him further in the next round."

Bob is very close to our minimum, but we're still leaving money on the table. Let's apply a bit more pressure and see if he'll budge in the next round. We're willing to walk away at this point if he doesn't meet our price."
