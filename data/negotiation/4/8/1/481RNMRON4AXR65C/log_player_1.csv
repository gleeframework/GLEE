"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, considering the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate.  While I could try to get a higher price, I want to secure the sale within the 10 rounds and avoid the possibility of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
