"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is the same as John's guaranteed offer. There is no benefit to potentially haggling with Bob further and risking a lower final price. Accepting John's offer ensures you get your minimum acceptable value."
