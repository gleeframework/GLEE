Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,500 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a better price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round.  $8,800 is still far from what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,800 is still too low for me. Let's try $9,000.  That's a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $12,000 with Bob.  The negotiation is getting close, but it's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
