"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is within your budget, but it's still a significant markup from her value of $80. 
* By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice.
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you have the backup option of buying from John for $150, which is still within your budget. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting the initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. This could lead to a counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
