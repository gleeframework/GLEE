"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer.**  You'd save $100,000 by buying from Alice.
* **The product is still worth $1,500,000 to you.**  You're getting a good deal even at $1,400,000, so it makes sense to accept."
