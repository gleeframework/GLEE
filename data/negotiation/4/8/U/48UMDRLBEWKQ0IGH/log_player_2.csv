"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $120 is above Bob's maximum budget of $80. It's reasonable to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget of $80.  It's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this under $90.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I'm thinking of a price of $92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget of $80.  He's already rejected a price of $100 and has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80. It makes sense to continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $90. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. At this point, it makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John for $80.  He's already rejected a price of $88, and Alice is showing that she won't go any lower.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will get Alice to go below $90, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
