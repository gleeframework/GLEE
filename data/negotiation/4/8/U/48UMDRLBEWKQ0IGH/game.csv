"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this under $90.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?",85.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",88.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $90. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair deal.",90.0,Alice,7,
