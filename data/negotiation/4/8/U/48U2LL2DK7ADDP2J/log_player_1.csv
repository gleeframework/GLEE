"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while also establishing a strong starting point.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to engage in negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is not too far from Bob's potential maximum, leaving room for him to counter-offer and potentially reach an agreement within the 10 rounds.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round, and the strategy may change based on Bob's response and how the negotiations progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I could accept and walk away with a profit, I have 10 rounds and a backup buyer, so it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I can use the next round to send a counteroffer that is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price, to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would give you a great product at a competitive price, and it allows me to stay within my acceptable range."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm stating my minimum acceptable price directly, but using a friendly tone to avoid seeming inflexible.
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is exactly at my minimum, which is also the point where Bob would be getting a good deal. This should give him incentive to consider accepting.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's value to him again, emphasizing how he'd still get a good price even at $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

* I'm taking a more assertive approach in this round, but I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob rejects again. 
* I'm hoping that by clearly stating my position and offering a middle ground, I can either secure a deal or at least move the negotiation in a more favorable direction for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  While time is running out, I have 6 rounds left and a backup buyer who will pay my minimum. This gives me some leverage to continue negotiating.
* **Possible Compromise:** There is still room to negotiate.  Bob's offer shows he is willing to move up a bit, which means a compromise might be possible.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still above his offer, to try to find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant value for you and is closer to my minimum acceptable range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** My counteroffer is a significant step down from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my position.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob will be getting at this price, highlighting that it's a win-win situation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage further negotiation and to gauge his reaction to my offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm using a strategic compromise to try to close the gap and reach an agreement. 
* By showing a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price above my minimum, I'm aiming to push Bob towards accepting my offer. 
*  I'm still aware of the time constraint and my fallback option with John, but I believe there's a good chance to secure a better deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stuck at a Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge above $1,200,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are halfway through the negotiations, and I'm getting closer to my fallback option.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  While Bob is currently firm, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price by making a final counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is slightly higher than his offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. This will be a final push to see if we can reach an agreement before resorting to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm confident that the value of this product justifies a slightly higher price. Let's compromise at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get this exceptional product while still staying within your budget.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm afraid that's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is a final counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground before resorting to John.
* **Compromise:**  The price is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product, hoping to convince Bob that the price is worth it.
* **Setting a Deadline:** I state that this is the lowest I can go, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to push Bob to accept this final offer.
* This counteroffer leaves no room for further negotiation and puts the ball in Bob's court. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will have no choice but to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is the absolute highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, the negotiation is not progressing favorably.
* **Unsatisfactory Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's Guarantee:**  John is a reliable buyer who will pay my minimum. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit. 

**Strategy:**

There is no point in continuing the negotiation with Bob. My goal is to maximize my profit, and John offers the most certain path to achieve that."
