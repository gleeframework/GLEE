"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $900,000. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $887,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
