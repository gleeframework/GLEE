"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my absolute maximum is $90. Would you be willing to consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to go to $97.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal!",97.5,Alice,5,
