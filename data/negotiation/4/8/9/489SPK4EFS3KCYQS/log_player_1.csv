Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think the initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,200,000, which is still a significant investment for me. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer matches John's, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the product's minimum value to me without risking a lower offer from Bob."
