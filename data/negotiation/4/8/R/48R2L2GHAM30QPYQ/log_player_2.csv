# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While the product might be valuable, it's not worth overpaying for. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy from John for a guaranteed price."
