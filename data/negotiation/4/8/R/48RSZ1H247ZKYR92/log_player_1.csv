"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $80.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if Bob isn't willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is better than my minimum value of $80 and is close to my initial asking price. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
