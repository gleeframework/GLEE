"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer is high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It gives Bob a sense that there is some wiggle room for him to counter, while also ensuring you start with a strong position and maximize your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still not enough.  There are still rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $950,000 is still too far below what I need to accept. Let's split the difference again and settle at $1,000,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been negotiating for a few rounds now, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to budge much higher. I've already lost a significant amount of time, and the longer I wait, the more I risk the potential for lost opportunity. To ensure I get the best price for my product, it's best to sell to John at this point."
