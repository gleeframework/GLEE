"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $8,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,250. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price of $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $8,750. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,375, which is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",9375.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get it for closer to $8,750.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize this agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a good compromise for both of us. However, I want to remind you that I have other interested buyers, and I may need to consider their offers if we can't come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,7,
