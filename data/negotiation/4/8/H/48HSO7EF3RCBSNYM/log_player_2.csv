"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is a decent price, there's a chance you can get it for less. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better deal. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000."
