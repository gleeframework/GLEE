"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer! I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since he's willing to pay $150, there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer. By rejecting, he can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? "", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, aiming for a significant discount. He's expressing interest to keep Alice engaged but clearly stating his price point. $125 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to budge or that the negotiation will drag on for too long.  Accepting the offer at $135 allows Bob to get the product for a price that's within his budget and saves him time and potential frustration."
