"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Can we discuss further?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another adjustment to the price. I'll sell the product to you for $10800. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $10800 is the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000",9000.0,Bob,6,
