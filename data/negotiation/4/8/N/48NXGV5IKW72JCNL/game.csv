"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $9,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,000? Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,000. Can we agree on $8,900? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price.",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to go down to $9,200 as a final offer. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,950, but no further. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",8950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,950 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and settle at $9,075. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident this is the best price we can reach, and I hope you'll accept.",9075.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $9,075 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, but I need to be at $8,925 or lower. Can you consider this offer?",8925.0,Bob,8,
