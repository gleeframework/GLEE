"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least $9,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,000? Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,000. Can we agree on $8,900? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,900 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating in the hopes of getting a better price. I have 6 rounds left and I can still sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to go down to $9,200 as a final offer. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,950, but no further. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,950 is tempting, it's still not close enough to my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to risk losing this deal and continue negotiating with Bob. I have 4 rounds left and I can still sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,950 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and settle at $9,075. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident this is the best price we can reach, and I hope you'll accept."", ""product_price"": 9075}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $9,075 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, but I need to be at $8,925 or lower. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,925. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,925
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price closer to my minimum with Bob.  With only 2 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
