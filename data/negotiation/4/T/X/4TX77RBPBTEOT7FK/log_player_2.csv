{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. While I appreciate her willingness to negotiate, I'm still not comfortable going above my $950,000 limit.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to my breaking point and might consider buying from John if this round doesn't get us closer."
