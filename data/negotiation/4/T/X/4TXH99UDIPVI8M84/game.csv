"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! How about we settle on $110? It's a great compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a little more than I'm willing to spend. How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and I think we can finalize the sale.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the best we can do. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
