"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential value of your product, $15000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, but I won't go any higher. Let me know if you're interested in discussing that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm prepared to go up to $10000 for the product. It's my absolute limit, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
