"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Would you be open to considering that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $15,000 is closer to my range, I'm still limited to $13,000. Would you consider a final price of $13,000 to close the deal?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still only able to go as high as $13,500.  This would allow us both to make a deal.  If you can't accept this price, I may need to consider another option.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,500, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
