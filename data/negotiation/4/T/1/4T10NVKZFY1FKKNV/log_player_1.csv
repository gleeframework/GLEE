{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $15,000 for it. It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by counter-offering.  It's worth exploring if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. How about $13,500?  I'm open to finalizing the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. It's higher than what John would pay, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely."
