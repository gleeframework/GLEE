Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:** You have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
