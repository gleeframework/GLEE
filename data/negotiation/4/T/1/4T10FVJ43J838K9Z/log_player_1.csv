Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim for a price higher than that. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, offering it slightly above his valuation might entice him while still generating a significant profit for Alice.
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle down the price.

By starting higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than her guaranteed sale price, Alice increases her chances of:

1. **Securing a Deal with Bob:**  He might see the value and accept the offer, especially if he perceives it as a ""good deal.""
2. **Still Profiting if Bob Declines:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John at her desired price."
