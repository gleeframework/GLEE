"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for you, considering the value it provides. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $100.  It's too early to give in, and I have 10 rounds to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $100 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, making it clear I'm serious about buying but also setting a firm boundary. This will help establish a negotiation range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125. I'm still a bit tight on budget though. How about $110?  It's a good middle ground and lets us both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's closer to Alice's latest offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. $110 is still within my budget, but it's a significant step closer to Alice's offer, showing a genuine attempt to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50.  This would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $117.50 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can get a deal closer to my target of $100.  I'm also mindful that John is always an option, and I don't want to overpay if I can avoid it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $117.50 is still a bit out of my range. I'm ready to go to $115. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm positioning this as my final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm increasing my offer to $115, showing willingness to meet halfway, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product for both of us, emphasizing that this price is fair and reflects the situation."
