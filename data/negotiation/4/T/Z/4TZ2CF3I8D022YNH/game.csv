"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $10500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",10500.0,Bob,6,
