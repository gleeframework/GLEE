"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me right now.  I could do $6,500.  What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate you're interested, $6,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'd need to be closer to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some wiggle room. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant jump from my last offer, and shows I'm serious about buying.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'd be happy to accept $8,500. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and leaves room for a fair deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,5,
