{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, it's getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm worried that I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  I also don't want to risk selling to John for $12,000."
