"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  The product is worth significantly more than $1,200,000, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to receive a reasonable price for the product. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see some movement from your side as well.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see your point about wanting a fair price, but I still believe this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,275,000, a compromise that reflects the product's worth and acknowledges your perspective. This feels like a reasonable starting point for us to find a final agreement. What are your thoughts?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
