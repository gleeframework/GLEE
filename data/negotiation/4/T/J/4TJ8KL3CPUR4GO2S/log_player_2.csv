"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's in your best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, and you can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and shows my willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping to find a price point that's acceptable to both of us while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm going to reject and try to negotiate further. I believe I can get a lower price, but if I can't, I'll fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm serious about purchasing the product from Alice. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum budget and leaving room for potential compromise.  I believe this price is a fair offer, considering Alice's previous counter-offer, and it increases the chances of a deal being reached."
