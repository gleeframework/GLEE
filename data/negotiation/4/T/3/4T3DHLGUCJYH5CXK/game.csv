"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While the product is good, $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $11,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,500? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,5,
