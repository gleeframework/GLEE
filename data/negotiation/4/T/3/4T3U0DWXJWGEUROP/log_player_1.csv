Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still above your minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It sets a clear expectation:**  It shows Bob you are serious about selling but are not desperate to sell for his initial price. 

By starting at $1,200,000, you leave space for negotiation, potentially landing a final price that's closer to your target of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum target of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $1,150,000. This price still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to give in to his initial low offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob and how the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Clear Goal:** The price of $1,150,000 is still above my minimum target of $1,500,000, but it's closer to Bob's offer, creating potential for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is still below my minimum target of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to risk going lower and potentially ending up with a deal that doesn't meet my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so it's the most logical choice at this point."
