"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $875,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  How about we settle on $900,000?  This is a good compromise that allows us both to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. $900,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $920,000 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,
