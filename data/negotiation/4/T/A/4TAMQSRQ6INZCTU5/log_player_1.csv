Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $90. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is a good offer, it's a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82.50?  That's still a good deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 82.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $82.50. I'm willing to pay $78 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your offers. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $80. This product is truly worth it, and it's the minimum I can accept.  Let me know if you're ready to make a deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 80}
