"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product would be valuable to me, but that price is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off.  Could we settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
