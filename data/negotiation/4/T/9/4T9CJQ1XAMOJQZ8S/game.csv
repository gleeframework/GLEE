"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not willing to go as low as $725,000. We're willing to compromise further and offer the product for $800,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
