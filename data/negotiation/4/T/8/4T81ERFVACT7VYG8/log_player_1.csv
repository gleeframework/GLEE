Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation, but I want to ensure I maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $125 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
