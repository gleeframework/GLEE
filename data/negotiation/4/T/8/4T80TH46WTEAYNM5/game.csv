"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be feasible?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. It's a win-win situation â€“ you get a valuable product at a reasonable price, and I get my minimum asking price.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
