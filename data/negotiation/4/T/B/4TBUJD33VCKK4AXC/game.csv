"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's quality and my budget constraints.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to consider your counteroffer. However, I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $125 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial proposal and your counteroffer.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and hope we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
