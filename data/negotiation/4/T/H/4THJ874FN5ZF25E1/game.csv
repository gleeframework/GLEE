"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  $990,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $980,000.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $980,000. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",985000.0,Alice,9,
