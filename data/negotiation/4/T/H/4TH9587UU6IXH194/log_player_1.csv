Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering a price too close to $12,000 might feel like I'm trying to squeeze every dollar out of him and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright.  
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John allows me to aim higher with Bob."
