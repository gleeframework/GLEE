"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my target price. $105 is a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and I'd rather make a sale than risk losing the deal altogether."
