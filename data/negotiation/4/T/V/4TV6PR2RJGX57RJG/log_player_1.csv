Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth a million dollars in the right hands. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 sets a strong baseline. However, we also know I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Therefore, aiming significantly higher is necessary.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,800,000 sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the potential value (""worth a million dollars in the right hands"") to justify the high price.
* **Urgency:** Calling it a ""unique opportunity"" subtly implies scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims high, there's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer. However, with a guaranteed sale to John, the potential reward of a much higher price outweighs the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
