"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return for you.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. I'm not sure if it's worth it for me at a higher price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
