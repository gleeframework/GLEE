"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable for you.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair starting point considering the potential value. Let's discuss and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $850000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better price. There's a possibility that Bob will increase his offer if he's truly interested. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is quite a bit below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated for the true value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would give us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value to you and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $975000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is significantly closer to my desired price point than his previous offers. It's only $50,000 less than my preferred price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing this deal altogether.  Given the limited rounds and the potential of selling to John for $800,000, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a good profit."
