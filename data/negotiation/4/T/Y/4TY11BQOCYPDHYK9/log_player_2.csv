"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** While Bob's maximum value is $15,000, Alice is offering the product for $14,000.  
* **Buying from John is more expensive:** John is selling the product for $15,000, which is more than Alice's offer. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
