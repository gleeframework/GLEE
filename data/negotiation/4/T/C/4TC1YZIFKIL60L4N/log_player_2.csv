Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but we're still quite a ways apart. I'm willing to make one more significant move to try and close this deal. If you're prepared to agree to $900,000, we have a deal. However, I need to be upfront â€“ this is my final offer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget and the guaranteed price from John. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you risk her walking away entirely if you counter.  Buying from John for $800,000 ensures you get the product within your budget."
