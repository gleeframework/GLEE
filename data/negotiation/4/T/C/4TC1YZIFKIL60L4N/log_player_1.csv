"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a high but still somewhat reasonable anchor price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room:** While I know Bob values it at $800,000, starting significantly higher gives me space to come down in subsequent rounds if needed.  
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides leverage. I don't need to settle for anything less than that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my valuation and John's offer. While I want to negotiate, accepting $600,000 would be a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's unique nature."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, which shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping the offer well above both Bob's initial offer and my fallback option with John.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the still-high price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Bob's true interest and flexibility. If he's unwilling to move significantly from his $600,000 offer, it might be time to consider John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is increasing his offer, but at a slow pace. We are still far apart, and I want to encourage him to move more substantially. 
* **John as Leverage:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, so there's no need to settle for less than that amount. 
* **More Rounds:** We have time for further negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still significant.  I'm willing to make another move and consider $950,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** I'm dropping my price by $150,000, signaling a willingness to compromise to reach a deal.
* **Midpoint Pressure:** This offer is slightly closer to my desired minimum ($1,000,000) than Bob's last offer, aiming to nudge him closer to my range.
* **Urgency and Justification:** By mentioning it's a ""substantial reduction"" and a reflection of my desire to close a deal, I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency while still justifying the high price. 
* **Information Gathering:** This offer will reveal if Bob is genuinely willing to meet closer to my minimum or if he's anchored to a much lower valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000 to try and close this gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer is still too low. He's moving in small increments, and at this rate, we're unlikely to reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have a strong alternative with John at $1,000,000. It's becoming clear that Bob may not be willing to reach a price point close enough to my minimum.
* **Potential Walk-Away Signal:**  Rejecting this offer might signal to Bob that I'm serious about my price and he needs to make a more substantial move if he wants the product.  It could prompt him to be more aggressive in his next offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but we're still quite a ways apart. I'm willing to make one more significant move to try and close this deal. If you're prepared to agree to $900,000, we have a deal. However, I need to be upfront â€“ this is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** It's time to signal that I'm nearing my limit. By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Slight Concession:** Dropping to $900,000 shows some flexibility while remaining above my guaranteed alternative with John.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, I need to push for a resolution. This offer creates a clear choice for Bob while still allowing me to walk away with my minimum acceptable outcome.
* **Preparation for John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm mentally prepared to walk away and proceed with selling to John."
