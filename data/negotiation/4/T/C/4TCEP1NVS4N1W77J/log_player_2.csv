"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** She's asking for $110.
* **John's Price:** You can get it from John for $120.

Since you can get it for the same price from John, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer gives you the chance to negotiate further or explore other options."
