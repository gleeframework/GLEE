"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's start with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about we meet at $1050000?  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $975000. Can we discuss further?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975000 is still a bit below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we settle at $1000000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my opportunity cost of selling to John for the same amount. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm willing to pay up to $995000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort you're putting into the negotiation. Can we meet at this price?,995000.0,Bob,6,
