"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a better price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than my target price.  While she's showing a willingness to negotiate, I believe I can push for a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and continue to counter-offer."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $975,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is closer to the middle ground.  This offer still provides you with a profit and is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price,  $980,000 is still a significant amount more than I'd like to pay.  I'm confident I can still negotiate a lower price, especially since I have several rounds left.  I'll continue to push for a better deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice is still holding firm at $985,000. While I've been able to negotiate her down somewhat, it's unlikely she'll come down to my target price. It's better to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $1,200,000.  I'm still saving a considerable amount of money compared to my initial budget."
