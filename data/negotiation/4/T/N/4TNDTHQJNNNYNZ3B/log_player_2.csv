"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  While its worth to me is significantly higher, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that I think is fair to both of us.  My offer is $1,200,000.  This gives you a significant opportunity to acquire something you value at $800,000 for a substantial discount.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
