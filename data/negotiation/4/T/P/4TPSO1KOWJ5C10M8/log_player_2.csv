Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. We're getting close, but we're not willing to go as low as $780,000. We're willing to meet you halfway between our previous offer and your latest offer, which would be $800,500. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $800,000.  It's unlikely further haggling will yield a significantly better result, and there's a risk she'll stop negotiating altogether. Taking the $800,500 offer is a good deal."
