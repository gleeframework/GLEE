"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation while still ensuring I don't undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still trying to stay above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better offer. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price again, but this time it's just a small difference from Bob's offer.  The goal is to show flexibility and hopefully get Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and Bob's offers are still significantly lower than my minimum.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so that's the best option at this point."
