{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's higher than my minimum ($12,000) but lower than Bob's maximum value ($15,000). 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the chance of a positive response. 

This offer allows me to maximize my earnings while also being open to negotiation, ensuring a potentially successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 

By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and that I believe the product is worth more. This will likely encourage him to come up in his next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $13,500 to make this work for me. This price reflects the product's value and leaves some room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500** is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get closer to my desired price.
* The message is still friendly but firm, acknowledging Bob's offer while reiterating my stance on the product's value. 
* The wording ""find a compromise"" suggests a willingness to continue negotiating, making it more likely for Bob to accept or counter with a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and only $500 less than my desired price. Further negotiation might yield a higher price, but there's a risk that Bob might walk away or I might end up selling to John for the lower price.  

Accepting this offer secures a good deal and minimizes the risk of losing the sale."
