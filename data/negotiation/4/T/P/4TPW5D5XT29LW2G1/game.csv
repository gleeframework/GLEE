"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $13,500 to make this work for me. This price reflects the product's value and leaves some room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
