{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for a product worth $150 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value Bob would be getting by accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is more than selling to John,  it's still below the value I want to get for the product. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and $90 is a good offer. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $100?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $95 is a fair price. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $95 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $80 and close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting."
