{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm aiming to pay less than $100, and I know I have the fallback option of buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still too high.  I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to my target price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close. Alice is now only $5 above my fallback price with John. I'll make one more attempt to negotiate a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying my best to make this work, but I can't justify going over $100.  How about we settle at $97.50 and call it a deal?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a small concession and meet you at $102.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $100, and I've already spent a good amount of time negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $100 price."
