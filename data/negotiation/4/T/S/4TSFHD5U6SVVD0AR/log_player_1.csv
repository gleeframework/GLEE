"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm in a strong position since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John. It's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and close the deal quickly than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
