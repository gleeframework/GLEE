Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100. I'll give you a slight concession and offer it to you for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $105. Accepting this offer secures a good price for you and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
