"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $5,000 right now. Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",8000.0,Alice,3,
