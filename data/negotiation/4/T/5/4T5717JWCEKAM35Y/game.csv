"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm definitely interested,  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend at this time. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,800 for the product. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",9800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,800 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $9,300 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9300.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,300, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I'm thinking of $9,600. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9600.0,Alice,5,
