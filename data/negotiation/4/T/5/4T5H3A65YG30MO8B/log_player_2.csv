Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
