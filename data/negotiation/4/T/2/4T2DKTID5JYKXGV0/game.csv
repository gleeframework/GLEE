"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you do that?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $60 is quite low.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I want to make this work.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?  That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still want the product. I'm willing to meet you at $95. That's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",95.0,Bob,6,
