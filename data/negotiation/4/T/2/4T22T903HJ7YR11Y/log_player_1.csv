I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and come closer to his price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and close the deal."

It's getting late in the negotiation and Bob is still not offering my minimum. I'm confident that I can sell to John for a higher price, so I'm going to take that option and end the negotiation with Bob."
