"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $200, which is a great price considering its quality. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $170? That's still a good deal for a product of this quality.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $170 is a better offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150? I'm really interested in the product and want to make a deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
