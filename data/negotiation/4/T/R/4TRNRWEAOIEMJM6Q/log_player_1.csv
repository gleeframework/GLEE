{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $200, which is a great price considering its quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $170? That's still a good deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 170}
