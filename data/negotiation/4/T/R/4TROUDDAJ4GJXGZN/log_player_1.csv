Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The price is significantly higher than John's $100 offer, ensuring I'm getting a good deal even if Bob declines."
