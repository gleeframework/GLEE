Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer from John for $80.

By offering the product to Bob at $95, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price Bob might accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, but you're still above your minimum.
* **Above Your Safety Net:** If Bob rejects your offer, you can still sell to John for $80."
