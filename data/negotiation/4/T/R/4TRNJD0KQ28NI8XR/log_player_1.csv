Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible while still ensuring the deal is appealing to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, but still guarantees a significant profit above my minimum ($8,000).
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob and suggesting this is a good deal for him."
