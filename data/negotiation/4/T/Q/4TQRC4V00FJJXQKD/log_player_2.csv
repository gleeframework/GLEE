"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $1,100,000. While it's worth significantly more to me, I believe this price is fair, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice's offer is too high. You can get a much better deal from John for $800,000, which is your maximum budget."
