"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,075,000? This would be a fair compromise and still allow you to get a great deal on a valuable product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,062,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at least $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already coming down from my initial offer. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider this offer and let me know if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
