Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $14,000 is close to Bob's perceived value of $15,000, increasing the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware I have a fallback option with John at $12,000, but aiming higher initially maximizes my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I am willing to pay $13,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer of $13,000 is tempting, there's still a gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I value the product higher and am willing to walk away if necessary. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept the first counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This counteroffer helps gauge how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and how much he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still committed to finding a fair price. I would like to propose $13,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $13,200 is a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield marginal gains. It's possible Bob won't go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a risk Bob will walk away if I push too hard. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
