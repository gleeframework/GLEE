"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000,  which is a fair price considering my needs.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still confident that this product can bring immense value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can afford at this time. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This price would allow us to both benefit from the deal and move forward. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $950,000 is still a significant amount.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can bring the price down even further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm appreciative of your flexibility, but $950,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $920,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $930,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where the price is getting very close to his budget.  He has already rejected several counteroffers from Alice. Although there are still 3 rounds left,  it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  At this point, it makes sense for Bob to stop the negotiation and buy the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures that Bob gets the product for his desired price and avoids the risk of the negotiations dragging on further."
