"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what you'd pay John, there's still room to negotiate. You can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $140.  This is a fair compromise, as it's still above Alice's value of $120. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is just $5 more than my counteroffer of $130. This is a good price for me, as it's below my maximum budget of $150 and leaves some room for potential negotiation.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer again, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
