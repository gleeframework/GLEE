"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $600000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $850000.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I can see that you're willing to pay $850000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've learned about your budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $950000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825000, but that's as high as I can go.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the bottom of the price range. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $950000, which is $887500. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and what we've discussed so far.",887500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $825000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price?",825000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop, but I'm still willing to try to find a mutually beneficial deal. I can see that you're really trying to get to $825000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to make a final compromise at $835000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's worth considering given the product's value.",835000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $835000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer: $820000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can meet at this price.",820000.0,Bob,10,
