Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I need the price to be more realistic. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $825,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but there's still a gap between our expectations. To be candid, I'm considering other options closer to $750,000. If you're able to meet me around there, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and his latest offer is getting close to our minimum.  We'll push a little harder to see if we can get closer to $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your candor and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $750,000 is really the absolute floor for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000?"",
