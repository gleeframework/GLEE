"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand it's a significant price difference. However, I can't go as low as $10000.  How about we meet in the middle at $15000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go at the moment. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's settle on $13500.  That's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
