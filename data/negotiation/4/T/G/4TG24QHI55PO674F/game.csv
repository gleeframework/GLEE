,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $160. This is the lowest price I can offer, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $120? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",120.0,Bob,4,
