"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
