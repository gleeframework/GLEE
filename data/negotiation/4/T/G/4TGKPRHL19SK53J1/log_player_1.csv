"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation but keeps the starting point advantageous.
* **Leaving Room:** I acknowledge the possibility of further discussion, signaling flexibility while not immediately undercutting my position.
* **Gauging Interest:** The message is designed to elicit Bob's initial reaction and gauge his level of interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below his perceived value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent this early in the process. I believe there's room to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, $1,050,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving to $1,100,000, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his offer.
* **Maintain Strength:**  However, the counteroffer still holds firm well above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum, reinforcing the product's value. 
* **Clear Justification:** Highlighting that $1,050,000 is a significant undervaluation reinforces my position and provides a rationale for the counter.
* **Direct Proposal:** A specific price suggestion (""would you consider..."") encourages a clear response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $1,075,000, which is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the $1,100,000 I countered with, it's still a significant profit margin above my $1,000,000 minimum. 

Here's why accepting makes sense now:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,075,000 is a $75,000 profit, which is a good outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate risks prolonged talks and the possibility of Bob lowering his offer further. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Relationship:**  Ending on a positive note by accepting a compromise builds goodwill for potential future interactions."
