Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000.  This is a bit of a gamble, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's so low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise, but it's still closer to my ideal price than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from him.  It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing with John."
