"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives us both a good margin and avoids any further back and forth. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - can you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
