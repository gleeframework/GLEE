"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108. Let's split the difference and make this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $109.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's close this deal!",109.0,Alice,5,
