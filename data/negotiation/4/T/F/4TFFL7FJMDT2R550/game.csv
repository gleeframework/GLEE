"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm happy to pay $950000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still a bit too far apart on our valuations.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair offer that acknowledges the product's worth and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal just yet. I'll meet you at $1050000, and that's my final offer. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
