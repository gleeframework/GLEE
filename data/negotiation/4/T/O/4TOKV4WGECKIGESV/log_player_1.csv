Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $1,075,000? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and he clearly sees value in the product. We'll push a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to wrap this up.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are getting closer to the later rounds, and Bob is very close to our initial desired price.  By stating this is our final offer, we add a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $1,050,000? I think this is the best we can do considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and accepting this offer gives us a $50,000 profit over our guaranteed sale to John.  It's not worth the risk of him walking away completely for a slightly higher offer."
