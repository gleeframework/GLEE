"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below my minimum asking price but still gives you a solid profit margin.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850,000. I hope we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
