I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is higher than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$90 is too low for me, I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is my minimum price and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer of $100 is still too low for me. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk lowering my price further.  Selling to John for $120 is the best option for me."
