"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer, as it is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $100. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $78 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to sell to John for $80. This ensures I get a price that is both fair and allows me to make a profit."
