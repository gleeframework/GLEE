"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to your business. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, which is still a good price for you considering your value. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is a significant drop. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000.  This is the lowest I'm prepared to go. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
