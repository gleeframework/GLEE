# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to your business. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,100,000. This is likely a good deal for her, but it's still above your $800,000 limit. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your maximum budget, but still above it.  It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice is firm on her price of $1,000,000, which is still above your maximum budget. It's likely you won't be able to get her any lower. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, it's the most financially responsible decision to buy from John."
