"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  How about $12,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
