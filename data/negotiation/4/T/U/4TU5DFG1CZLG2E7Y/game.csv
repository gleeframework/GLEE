"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you consider $75?  Let's see if we can make this work!",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $78? I really want to purchase this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $81. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
