"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant and $800,000 is considerably below its worth.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
