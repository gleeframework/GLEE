"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring the negotiation process to see if you can get a better price. There are 9 rounds left to negotiate, so you have plenty of time to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $600,000.  I believe this product is valuable, but I need to ensure the price reflects my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is still within your budget, leaving room for compromise.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value while emphasizing budget constraints helps create a sense of fairness and encourages Alice to consider your offer.
* **Open to compromise:** The message emphasizes finding ""common ground,"" suggesting flexibility and a willingness to work towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:**  Instead of a drastic jump, this counteroffer is a smaller step towards Alice's price, showing you're serious about negotiating while maintaining leverage.
* **Reiterate Fairness:**  Emphasizing ""fair price"" and mutual benefit encourages Alice to view this offer as a positive compromise.
* **Urgency Implied:**  The phrase ""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"" subtly suggests a desire to move forward, pushing Alice to consider accepting your offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $712,500.  This feels like a good middle ground, and it allows us to finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 712500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering to split the difference between your last offer and Alice's demonstrates a commitment to reaching a compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $712500. I'm willing to meet you at $720000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her counteroffers are getting smaller.  $720,000 is a good price, and it's within your budget.  Accepting the offer allows you to acquire the product without risking the possibility of needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
