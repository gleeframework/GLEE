Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $5,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation. 
* I want to see if I can get an even better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* This will show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and hopefully push her to consider a lower price. 
* $4,000 is still within my budget, but it leaves room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer.
*  $4,500 is a good deal considering my maximum budget is $8,000. 
*  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a good price."
