"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, while also acknowledging your budget concerns.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to keep costs down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
