"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair price considering your value for it. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,000,000?  This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and it would allow me to save some money.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to save some money, but $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'll counter with $1,050,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
