{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but allows for some negotiation room.  It's also below my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to lower the price if necessary.  I'm also confident in the product's value, so I'm starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great price for this high-quality product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating,  it's likely that Bob won't budge much further.  To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of value, I'll sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I meet my minimum price and saves me time and effort."
