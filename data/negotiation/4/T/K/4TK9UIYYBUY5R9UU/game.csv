"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our interests. Let's get this deal done.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
