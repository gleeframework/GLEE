"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe is worth every penny. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This is a starting point, giving a 16.67% markup. I've included a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel valued. If Bob rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. Remember, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating to try to secure a better deal. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can reach a more profitable agreement with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I still have 6 rounds left and I want to maximize my profits. I'm confident we can find a more mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our interests. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to maximize my profit, I need to ensure I don't lose the deal entirely. John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum, so selling to him now ensures I don't risk getting a worse deal later."
