"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation and maximize my profit. I believe this price is reasonable given my minimum and Bob's valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob, so I'll move on to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's getting closer to my initial offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $175, I want to be mindful of the limited rounds remaining and the certainty of getting $150 from John. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
