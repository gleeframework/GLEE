Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $155. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully leads to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get $150, Bob's offer of $145 is close enough to my minimum and it's likely we won't get any closer. It's better to secure the sale with Bob than risk further negotiations and potentially lose him as a buyer."
