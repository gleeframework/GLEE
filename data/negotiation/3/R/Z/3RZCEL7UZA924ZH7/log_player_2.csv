(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's price.  We'll see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $5,000 is a significant discount from her initial price, but still leaves some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still above my ideal price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  $5,500 is a good compromise point, and hopefully, Alice will see that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $5,700 is getting very close to my target price, and I'm willing to take the deal.  I'm confident I've gotten a good price, and it's better than going with John at $10,000."
