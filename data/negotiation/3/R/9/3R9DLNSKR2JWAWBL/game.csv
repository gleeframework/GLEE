"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120, so I'll offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
