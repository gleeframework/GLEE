"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much room for negotiation there is.  My goal is to get the price as close to $120 as possible, but I'm willing to pay a little more if I can get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation before I hit my $120 walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price."",
 ""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

I'm going straight to my ideal price point.  It's possible Alice might accept, but even if she counters, this establishes a strong position for the rest of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120, so I'll offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for $120, Alice is unlikely to go that low. Accepting $130 is a good compromise, saving me $10 compared to John's offer and avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
