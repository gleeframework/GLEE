"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, though.  How about $9,000?  That's the absolute most I can do.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $12,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
