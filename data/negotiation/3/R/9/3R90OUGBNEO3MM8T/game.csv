"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you can work with.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we split the difference closer to my last offer, say $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
