Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me because I can sell it to John for that price.
* **Potential for higher profit:** I'm aiming for a higher price than $12,000 to maximize my profit. 
* **Risk assessment:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject my offer. However, I believe a $15,000 offer is reasonable enough to be attractive to Bob while still leaving me with a substantial profit.

By offering $15,000, I'm balancing the desire for higher earnings with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If he rejects, I still have the guarantee of $12,000 from John."
