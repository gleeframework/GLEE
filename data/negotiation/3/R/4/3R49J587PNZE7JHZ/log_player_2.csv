Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is getting smaller.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
