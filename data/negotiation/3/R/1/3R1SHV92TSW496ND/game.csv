"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to finding a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is really the most I can justify spending.  If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to pass.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a hard limit for you, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
