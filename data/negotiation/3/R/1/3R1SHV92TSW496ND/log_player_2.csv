Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but it's worth one more try to see if we can get it for $12,000."

We're at the point where we need to be firm with Alice. This counteroffer reiterates our maximum price and subtly implies we might walk away if she doesn't accept."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a hard limit for you, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go lower. Accepting her final offer would mean overpaying by $1,000. Buying from John ensures we stay within budget."
