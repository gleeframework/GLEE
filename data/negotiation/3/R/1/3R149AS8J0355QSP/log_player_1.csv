Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob is ideal.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so the offer needs to be attractive but leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal while leaving me space to potentially drop to $900,000 or slightly lower.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
