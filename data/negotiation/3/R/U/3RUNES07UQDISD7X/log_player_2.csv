Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $100? I'm serious about buying it, and that's the most I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $125 is still above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only able to go up to $110.  It's a good compromise, and I'm truly interested in getting this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
