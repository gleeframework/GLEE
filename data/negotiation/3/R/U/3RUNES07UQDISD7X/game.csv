,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $100? I'm serious about buying it, and that's the most I can do right now.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only able to go up to $110.  It's a good compromise, and I'm truly interested in getting this product. Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,
