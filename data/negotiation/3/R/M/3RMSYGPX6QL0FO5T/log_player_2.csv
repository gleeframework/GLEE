# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,200,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity:

* **Potential for Negotiation:** Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. There's room to negotiate between $1,100,000 and your backup price of $1,200,000. 

It's always better to explore the possibility of a lower price before resorting to your backup plan."
