"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has great potential for your business, and I'm confident it can deliver significant value.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's quality and its potential to drive your growth. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal. 
* **John is a backup option.** If negotiations with Alice fall apart, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product has potential, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's work together to find a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product's value.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $950,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left, and you can continue to try and lower the price. 
* **John remains a backup option.**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can still secure the product from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows you a fair return. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  While $925,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to stay above $940,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $945,000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and its potential for your business.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $945,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $945,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  At $945,000, you're within $15,000 of your ideal price. 
* **You're nearing the end of negotiations.**  You have only 5 rounds left.  
* **John's offer is much higher.**  By accepting Alice's offer, you can save $255,000 compared to buying from John.

While it's still possible to negotiate further, the potential savings are relatively small, and the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price increases with each round. It's a reasonable risk to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's."
