"Alice, your product has potential, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's work together to find a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this product's value.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $950,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows you a fair return. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  While $925,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to stay above $940,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $945,000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and its potential for your business.  Let's finalize this deal.",945000.0,Alice,5,
