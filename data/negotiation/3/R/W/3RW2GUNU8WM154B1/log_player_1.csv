Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high.  Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still not close enough to my minimum. I need to keep applying pressure and see how high he's willing to go."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While I agree this product has value, $1,125,000 is still a little too steep for me.  To be honest, my absolute top limit is $1,000,000. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum price is $1,000,000.  It's clear he won't budge beyond this point. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and secure the higher profit. Continuing negotiations with Bob has a low chance of success and carries the risk of losing John's offer."
