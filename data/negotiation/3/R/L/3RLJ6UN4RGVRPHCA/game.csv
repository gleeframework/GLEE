"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value of the product to you. However, I would like to counter with an offer of $925,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I'm happy to keep negotiating, $925,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.  If not, I'll be reaching out to John to see if he's still interested.",950000.0,Alice,5,
