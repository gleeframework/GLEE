Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its value and potential, I'm valuing it at $1,150,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my true value ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) creates a negotiation space.
* **Exclusivity Appeal:**  Highlighting that Bob has the first chance creates a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion if he doesn't take the offer.

This approach aims to secure the best possible deal while leaving room for potential negotiation with Bob."
