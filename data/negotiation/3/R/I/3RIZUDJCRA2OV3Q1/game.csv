"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000. How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,250 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,125.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.",9125.0,Bob,6,
