"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob wants to start close to his limit but leave some room for negotiation. $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about saving money.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $8,500 allows for a potential middle ground while still keeping Bob within his budget. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message keeps the negotiation friendly and avoids being overly aggressive, which could lead to a breakdown in communication."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000. How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $9,500 is still above Bob's desired $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get closer to his target price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation process.
* **Avoiding the ""Safe"" Option:**  While buying from John for $8,000 is a guaranteed deal, Bob might be able to get a better price with Alice if he continues negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob is offering a compromise by splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  Bob emphasizes the ""win-win"" aspect, highlighting the potential benefit for both parties.
* **Keeping it Friendly:** The tone remains positive and respectful, promoting continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $9,250 is still above Bob's target of $8,000. While Alice is getting closer to his price, it's still not within his desired range. 
* **Possible Compromise:**  There's still a small gap between Bob's preferred price and Alice's offer. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a final counteroffer to bridge the gap.
* **Weighing the Options:** While buying from John is always an option, Bob still sees the potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,250 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,125.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Bob is making a clear statement that this is his final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  He's offering a price halfway between his previous offer and Alice's last one, demonstrating a genuine desire to reach a compromise.
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is direct and avoids unnecessary fluff, focusing on the key point: the price."
