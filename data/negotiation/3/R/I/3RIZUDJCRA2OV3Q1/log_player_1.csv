"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $8,500 is still too far below my minimum.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000. How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,250 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,125.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my target price, $9,125 is a decent offer and I'm starting to run out of time.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John at a lower price."
