Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason for your price, even if it's just perceived value, can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage further. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving you the option to negotiate down to a price closer to $80 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own perceived value ($80). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you.  It's clear there's room for negotiation, so rejecting this offer and presenting a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob.  While I understand your initial offer, $60 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could you do something closer to $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Compromise:** This response acknowledges Bob's offer but immediately counters with a price significantly closer to your desired range. 
* **Gradual Negotiation:** Instead of meeting in the middle immediately, this counteroffer encourages a more gradual negotiation process, which can be beneficial in maximizing your final price.
* **Maintain Value:** The message doesn't provide a reason for the higher price, subtly reinforcing the idea that the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, but you're also very close to securing a sale at your desired price with John. It's worth risking one more counteroffer to see if Bob will increase his offer closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Bob.  How about we settle at $80? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message clearly states that this is your final offer, adding a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Meet Your Minimum:** This offer meets your absolute minimum acceptable price, ensuring you don't make a loss.
* **Potential for Acceptance:** Bob's counteroffer of $70 suggests he's willing to pay a reasonable price, and this offer might be tempting enough for him to accept.
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John for your desired price."
