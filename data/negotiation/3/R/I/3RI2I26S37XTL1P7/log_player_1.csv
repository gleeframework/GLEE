Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed amount. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While continuing the negotiation might lead to a slightly higher offer from Bob, it's getting increasingly risky. Bob is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price, and there's no guarantee he'll reach it. John offers a safe and immediate $800,000, which is our bottom line. It's better to secure a guaranteed profit now than risk ending up with a lower offer or a stalemate with Bob."
