"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum and leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a small increase from Bob's offer but it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get as close as possible to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,600. This is a good compromise as it's significantly higher than selling to John and closer to my desired price. It's also likely that Bob won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
