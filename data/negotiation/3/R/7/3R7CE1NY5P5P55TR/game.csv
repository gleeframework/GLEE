"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product well worth it. Let's try to close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is fair for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",15000.0,Bob,4,
