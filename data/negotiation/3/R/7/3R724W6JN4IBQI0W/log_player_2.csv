"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but he can likely get a better deal.  He should see what Alice's counteroffer is before deciding whether to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target, it's still a bit higher than he'd like to pay. He can likely negotiate a better price with Alice, given her desire to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $13,250 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point. Let's split the difference at $12,875. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 12875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. Let's try $13,000 as a compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is a good deal for him, considering his budget and the fact that he can get the product for a lower price than John's offer. It's getting closer to his desired price range, and he can secure the product without risking further negotiation."
