Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, as I know Bob values it at $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my goal of maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum price and hopefully closer to a point where Bob will be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a bit more in the next round. I'm also considering John's offer as a backup option in case the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is a bit lower than my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum price. It's a move to see if Bob is willing to come up slightly to close the deal."
