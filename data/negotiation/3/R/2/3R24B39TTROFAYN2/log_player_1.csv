"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which is still a great value for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is closer to my target price, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that's more favorable to me.  I still have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer on price. How about $1,050,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to finding a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think we can do better. How about $980,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $980,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little more for the product.  I have a few more rounds left and I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $980,000 just isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $1,015,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1015000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,015,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one! Bob's offer of $990,000 is tempting, but it's still a little lower than I'd like to accept. I only have two rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. 

Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale and I can't risk losing the deal entirely."
