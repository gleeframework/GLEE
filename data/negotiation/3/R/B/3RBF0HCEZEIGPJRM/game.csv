"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $160 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go for $137.50? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $137.50. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $142.50. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a price you can live with.",142.5,Alice,5,
