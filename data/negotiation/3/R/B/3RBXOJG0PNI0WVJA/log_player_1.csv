Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is still below the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher price.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message makes Bob feel valued and more open to negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage him to engage in a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation on a positive note while securing a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 threshold I set for myself. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my initial offer of $140. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to potentially drive up the price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to continue negotiating. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about we split the difference at $135? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by dropping my price slightly from $140 to $135. 
* **Middle Ground:** Splitting the difference creates a sense of fairness and might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us, making the offer more appealing.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without selling for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $132? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $132 is just above my minimum price of $100.  While it's not ideal, it's a decent return considering the negotiation process.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that continued negotiation could lead to a lower offer from Bob or a deadlock. 
* **Time factor:**  Continuing negotiations could take longer, potentially leading to a delay in the sale and a chance of losing Bob as a buyer altogether.

Given the close proximity to my minimum price, the potential for further negotiation, and the time factor, accepting Bob's offer at $132 seems like the best option at this point."
