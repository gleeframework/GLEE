Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob ($1,200,000) and my minimum acceptable price is the same, I start by aiming higher ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Confident Tone:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant value"" emphasizes the product's desirability and might encourage Bob to accept a higher price.
* **Direct Approach:** I state my offer clearly without beating around the bush. This projects confidence and sets the stage for a potentially quick negotiation.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, with John as a backup buyer, I'm secure in knowing I can still sell the product at my minimum acceptable price."
