"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $80. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120, but that's still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. It's my maximum, but I'm really interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than my maximum budget of $80.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John, who is selling it at my target price. I've already shown Alice I'm serious about buying the product but can't go higher than $80, so further negotiation is unlikely to be successful."
