Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I see the value in your product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it's the maximum I can afford right now.
