"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I see the value in your product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it's the maximum I can afford right now.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think $1,020,000 is the minimum I can accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it brings to you, and it's a small discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,
