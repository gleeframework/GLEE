"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,020,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $1,000,000 and we're running out of rounds. It's not worth the risk of her staying above our limit.  Buying from John guarantees we get the product at the best possible price."
