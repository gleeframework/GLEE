{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$850,000 is a good starting price, but I can likely get it lower. I want to see if Alice is willing to go lower before committing."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 17.6% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows my intent to negotiate seriously and sets the stage for further bargaining."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I still believe I can get a better price. I want to see if she's willing to go lower before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal target. This keeps the negotiation moving and might prompt Alice to make a more favorable offer in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $762,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $762,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $12,500 away from my last counteroffer.  I'm still confident I can get a slightly better price, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can close the deal on the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 755000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price.  I think that this price is reasonable and might be enough to convince Alice to accept the deal, especially considering that the price is getting closer to her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a price closer to my last counteroffer, Alice's offer is getting very close.  With only three rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John at a much higher price is becoming more significant. Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price while still leaving some room for potential negotiation with John if necessary."
