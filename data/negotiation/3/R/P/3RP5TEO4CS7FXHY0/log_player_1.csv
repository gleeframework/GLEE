Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable. How does $145 sound?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is in the product and his potential price range. 
 
If Bob rejects this offer, you can always negotiate down or proceed to sell to John at your guaranteed price."
