{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* This price is also below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150), allowing for a potential compromise. 
* By being positive and emphasizing the product's value, I aim to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$140** is a compromise price between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). 
* This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a price that is still profitable for me. 
* My message is friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I really like the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.
* Selling to John for $150 ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
