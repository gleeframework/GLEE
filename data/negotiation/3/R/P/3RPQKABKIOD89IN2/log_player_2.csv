"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a guaranteed alternative at the same price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product for your maximum budget."
