"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $13,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I'm still not willing to sell the product at $14,000, as it's worth more to me. However, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price. I'm offering it to you for $15,500. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15500.0,Alice,5,
