{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price, especially considering Bob values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting the value you place on the product.  This offer is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. How about $925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While $925,000 is closer to my target, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'm confident that Bob values the product enough that he'll come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference again - how about $937,500? This would be a good middle ground for us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $937,500. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000 was a bit low for me, and $937,500 is a bit high. How about $930,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $930,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and I'm getting closer to my target.  I also need to be mindful of the limited rounds and the risk of having to sell to John for $800,000."
