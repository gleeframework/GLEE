{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:**  By starting at a price that's not my absolute minimum, I allow room for Bob to counter-offer without immediately hitting my limit. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he counter-offers, I'll analyze his offer and determine my next move. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll consider making a slight adjustment in price or using a different approach to persuade him. However, I'll also keep in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and even lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle for a price that low.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or at least closer to his perceived value.  I want to see if I can bridge the gap. If Bob is unwilling to budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as that's my guaranteed minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? It's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's counter-offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him by emphasizing the product's value.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** $11,000 is still above Bob's perceived value, allowing me to potentially negotiate further if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response carefully. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll consider my options:

* **Lowering the Price:** I might be willing to drop to $10,500 depending on how determined Bob seems.
* **Walking Away:** If Bob remains insistent on a very low price, I'll seriously consider selling to John to secure my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,000 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle yet.
* **Bob's ""final offer"" tactic:** Bob's stating this is his ""final offer"" is a common negotiation tactic. I won't be pressured into accepting just because he says it's his last offer.
* **Opportunity to potentially increase the price:** If I reject, there's a chance I can convince Bob to go slightly higher.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to $11,000. I'll reiterate that I'm willing to compromise, but I also need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. If Bob remains firm at $10,000, I'll seriously consider selling to John for my guaranteed minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This demonstrates a continued willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize that this price is fair for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the deal:**  I express confidence in our ability to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept if Bob accepts:** If Bob accepts my offer, I'll finalize the sale and be happy with the outcome.
* **Consider selling to John:** If Bob rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000.  While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, my minimum remains $15,000. I'm not willing to lose much more time on this negotiation if Bob won't budge."
