"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1 million for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial offer is $950000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your target price of $1 million.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds and a clear goal, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's price is a fallback:** If the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant drop:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness about negotiating.
* **Reasonable starting point:** $850,000 is still above Alice's minimum value, giving her room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** The message emphasizes a desire for a fair deal, setting a more collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $850000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your target price of $1 million.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  You have 7 rounds left, and there's likely room for Alice to come down further. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  You can potentially get a better deal if you continue negotiating.
* **John's price is a backup:** You can always buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to offer $875,000. This shows I'm serious about making a deal, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but steady progress:** This offer is a smaller decrease from Alice's last offer, showing you're willing to meet halfway. 
* **Staying within your budget:** $875,000 is still within your target price of $1 million.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** The message uses language like ""compromise"" and ""fair price"" to maintain a collaborative approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $875000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm prepared to accept $890000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to your target price of $1 million.
* **Negotiation is likely over:**  Alice has already moved significantly from her initial price, and you have only 5 rounds left. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product and avoid the risk of a failed negotiation.
* **John's price is a safety net:**  If you're still concerned, you can always fall back on John's offer. 

While you could try for a lower price, it's unlikely you'll get a better deal within the remaining rounds.  Accepting Alice's offer minimizes your financial risk and allows you to purchase the product within your budget."
