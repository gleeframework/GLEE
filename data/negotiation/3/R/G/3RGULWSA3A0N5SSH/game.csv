"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1 million for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial offer is $950000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value of this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850000. This reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $850000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to offer $875000. This shows I'm serious about making a deal, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $875000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm prepared to accept $890000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",890000.0,Alice,5,
