# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I understand its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing a mutually agreeable price, but I believe this is a fair starting point.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I value your business, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,125,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,175,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation. Let's be realistic. $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer. Continuing to push could backfire, leaving us with no deal from Alice and forced to go with John at a higher price. Accepting at $1,162,500 secures a decent discount."
