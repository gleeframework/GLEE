"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.  Please let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  I believe this would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate us trying to find middle ground here.  While I want to make this work, $1,000,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
