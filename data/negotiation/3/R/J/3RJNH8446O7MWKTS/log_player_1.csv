"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant amount, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm going to see if I can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm offering $1,750,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still puts me above my minimum value. I'm hoping to find a compromise that satisfies both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000.  I'm hoping this is a more reasonable price for Bob, but I'm still holding out for a value that's closer to my minimum.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm determined to get the best deal possible."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, I still believe there's room for a better deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum value if I keep negotiating.  With only four rounds left, the pressure is on, but I'm not ready to settle yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm offering $1,550,000.  This is only $50,000 above my minimum value, and I'm hoping it's tempting enough for Bob to accept. With only three rounds left, I need to be decisive and close the deal.  This offer shows I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to go any lower."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John. With only two rounds left, I don't think I can get a better price from Bob.  While I'm slightly disappointed I couldn't get a higher price, John's offer is still above my minimum value and guarantees me a sale."
