"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it allows for some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe there's potential to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from his last offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to show him that I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,850,000 is a good deal considering the limited rounds left.  It's significantly higher than selling to John and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go much higher."
