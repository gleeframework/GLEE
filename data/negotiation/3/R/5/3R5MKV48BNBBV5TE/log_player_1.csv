Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $100 minimum, so you're not underselling yourself.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and makes the offer attractive to Bob. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It quickly gets to the point and encourages a response from Bob. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I am willing to pay $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than the value I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I am comfortable paying up to $115 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal of $130, Bob's offer of $115 is still a good deal. It's higher than what John is offering, and further negotiation might not yield much more. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
