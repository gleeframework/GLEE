"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we have decided to offer it to you at a special price of $1,350,000. We believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the value you would receive from the product. Please let us know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'd receive. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After reviewing your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $1,300,000. We believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product offers. Please let us know if this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000 and guarantee a deal within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but it also risks losing the opportunity to buy from John altogether."
