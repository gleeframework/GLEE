"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This product truly is valuable, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
