"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects both the value of the product to me and a fair return for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

This price still offers you a significant value compared to what you'd gain elsewhere.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
