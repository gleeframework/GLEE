Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to pay a substantial price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'd like to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
