Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even more so than the apparent value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start the negotiation higher. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression the product might be worth even more to Bob.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob valuing the product at $8,000 doesn't mean that's his absolute ceiling. He might be willing to pay slightly more if he sees the value you're placing on it.  This initial offer helps you understand his position better. 
* **Quick Sale vs. Negotiation:**  While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, a quick sale to Bob at a higher price might be more profitable. This offer aims for that quick sale, but be prepared to negotiate down if Bob shows resistance."
