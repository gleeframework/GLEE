"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire an item that is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still above your ideal price. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price. It's always better to explore all options before resorting to the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering your value of $800,000 and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a middle ground between our previous offers, and I believe it will be beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal. You have several rounds remaining to negotiate, and it's worth exploring if you can get a price closer to your target of $850,000. Buying from John at this stage would be a significantly worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with this offer."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of our discussions, I am prepared to offer the product to you for $890,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us and provides a reasonable profit for me while staying within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not your absolute ideal price of $850,000, it's very close and a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  With several rounds remaining, there's a chance you could continue negotiating, but the risk of the deal falling apart and having to buy from John is high. Accepting the offer here secures a good deal and avoids unnecessary risk."
