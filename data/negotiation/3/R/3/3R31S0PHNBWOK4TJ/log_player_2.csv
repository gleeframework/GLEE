# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, saving $350,000."
