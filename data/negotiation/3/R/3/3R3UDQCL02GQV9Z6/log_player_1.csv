"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  This is a unique product with significant upside potential."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  We want to anchor Bob's perception of value high. While $1,300,000 is significantly above his perceived value, it gives us room to negotiate and still land above $1,000,000.
* **Justification:**  We're not just throwing out a number. Highlighting the ""unique"" nature and ""upside potential"" subtly justifies the high price, even without going into specifics.
* **Positive Tone:** We want to maintain a collaborative and optimistic tone throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and it's within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). While his counter-offer is a reasonable jump from his initial valuation, we have plenty of room to negotiate and John provides a solid safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Bob's perspective helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Hold Firm (But Compromise):** We're coming down in price, but not drastically.  The $1,150,000 counteroffer keeps us well above our minimum while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reiterate Value:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits to justify the price.
* **Find a Balance:** We're aiming to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and it's a significant step toward reaching an agreement.  Let's keep the conversation going and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still below our absolute minimum. Bob is clearly willing to move on price, so we'll continue negotiating, but with John as our safety net, we're in a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down further to $1,050,000. I believe this is my final offer and reflects a fair compromise that considers both the product's value and your budget."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're firm on this price.
* **Justification:**  We're framing the price as a compromise, reinforcing the idea that we've made concessions.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,050,000 price gives us a $50,000 buffer above our minimum while still being a significant step down from our previous offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're halfway through the rounds, which adds subtle pressure for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the best I can do. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is anchored at $950,000 and unwilling to budge further. We've hit our limit, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Time is a factor, and it's better to secure a sure thing.
* **Strong Alternative:** John's offer provides a clean and immediate solution at our desired price point."
