Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $130. It's a steal at this price, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than what I value the product at ($150), but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also high enough that Bob might be willing to consider it, given the value he sees in the product ($80)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell the product for $115, Bob is firm on $110. Accepting his offer is better than risking a longer negotiation or selling to John for $150. It's a good compromise and still a profitable deal for me."
