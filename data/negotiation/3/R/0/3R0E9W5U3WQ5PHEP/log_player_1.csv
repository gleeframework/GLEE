Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll make an offer that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 14,000}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $12,000. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I think it's reasonable to accept Bob's offer. I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll sell the product to Bob for $12,000."
