{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:** It's significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob, making it a good value proposition. 
* **It allows for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can then gauge his interest and potentially lower the price slightly. 

Remember, you can always use the ""fallback"" offer from John to push for a better deal with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still far below what you believe the product is worth.  There's room for negotiation, and you can try to secure a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to your desired price. It's also a sign that Bob is seriously interested in the product. Accepting his offer will ensure a quick sale and a decent profit."
