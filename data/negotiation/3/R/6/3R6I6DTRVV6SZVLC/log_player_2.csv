{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting at her maximum price.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer now. By rejecting it, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or see if she's willing to come down at all.  You haven't lost anything because you can always buy from John for $100 as a backup."
