"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate its value, I am looking to keep the investment within a budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting the negotiation very low, and while there's room to negotiate upwards, it's unlikely he'll reach our minimum price of $1,500,000 within a reasonable number of rounds. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which meets our minimum.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk a prolonged negotiation with Bob that might not end favorably."
