"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum. I'm hoping to leverage the fact that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he might be willing to negotiate up to a certain point. I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but it's closer. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll keep selling to John as a fallback option in case negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this move will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. I'll keep monitoring the situation and consider selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him for now, as there's still room for improvement. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price. Selling to John remains my backup plan if the negotiations with Bob don't reach a satisfactory conclusion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's above my minimum.  I'm hoping that by making a more significant concession, I can push Bob closer to accepting a price that is more favorable for me.  I'm aware that I can always sell to John if negotiations fall apart, but I'm determined to get the best possible price from Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds. I'll accept this offer and sell the product to Bob. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling to John for a slightly higher amount, and it avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer."
