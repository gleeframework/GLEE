"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
