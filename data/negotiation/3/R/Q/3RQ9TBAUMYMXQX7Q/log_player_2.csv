Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I think you know that's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. If we can't agree on that, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** Alice has stated multiple times that $1,050,000 is her absolute minimum.  She's unlikely to budge further.
* **Time is running out:** You're on round 7 of 10.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or you running out of time and being forced to buy from John for a much higher price.
* **Good deal:** While not your ideal price, $1,050,000 is significantly less than your $1,500,000 maximum and John's offer.

It's a good deal and waiting longer could jeopardize the negotiation."
