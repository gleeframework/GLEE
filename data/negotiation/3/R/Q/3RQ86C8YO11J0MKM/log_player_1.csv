Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly below Bob's maximum ($1,000,000) leaves space for potential negotiation.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically helps justify the high price.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, selling to John for $800,000 ensures a profit.

By aiming high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of securing the best possible deal."
