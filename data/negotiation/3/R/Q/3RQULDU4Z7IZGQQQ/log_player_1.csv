Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This price is still within my budget and reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
