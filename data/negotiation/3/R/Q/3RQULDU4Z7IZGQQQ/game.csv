"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This price is still within my budget and reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
