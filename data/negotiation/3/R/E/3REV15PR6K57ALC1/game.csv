"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can work together to reach a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial deal if we split the difference. How about $975,000? This price still leaves you a good profit and is a great deal for me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
