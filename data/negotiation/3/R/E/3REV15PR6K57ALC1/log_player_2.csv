"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident we can work together to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is too high.  You can get a better deal by negotiating further or buying from John as a last resort."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my target. I'm willing to risk further negotiation to try to get a lower price.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is still within my budget. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's likely that further negotiation won't get me a significantly better deal. Buying from John would cost significantly more, so accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sound choice."
