"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting halfway. But $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close here. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  I really want to make this deal work, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final counteroffer.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
