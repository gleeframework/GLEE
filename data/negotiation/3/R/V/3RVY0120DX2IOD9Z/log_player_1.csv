"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I've left room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Emphasis on value:** I've highlighted the product's value to Bob to make the offer seem more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round that's more appealing to Bob but still closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $10,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a great value.  Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm reducing my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Not giving in entirely:**  $10,500 is still a decent price for me, especially considering my minimum.
* **Staying firm on value:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition to Bob, reminding him of the potential savings. 
* **Finding common ground:** I'm using language that suggests we're both trying to reach a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,500 is still a considerable distance from my minimum of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob seems willing to compromise, I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  If I can't reach an acceptable agreement with Bob, selling to John guarantees my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, showing flexibility.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing the price as a compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of a fair deal.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a good opportunity for both of us, implying that the price might not be available for long. 
* **Keeping options open:** I'm still willing to walk away if necessary, reminding Bob that selling to John is a possibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $9,250? I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,250 is still significantly less than my minimum target of $15,000. 
* **Time is running out:** While I have only four rounds left, I'm not in a desperate situation yet. 
* **Potential for a better price:** Bob seems determined to get the product, and I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **John is a reliable backup:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit, so I have the flexibility to continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you loud and clear.  I'm willing to make one last concession to close this deal. How about $9,750?  That's a great price for you, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  This is a win-win for both of us, and let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is my last counteroffer, emphasizing that I'm close to my limit. 
* **Splitting the difference again:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency and finality:** I'm using language like ""one last concession"" and ""absolute lowest"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Win-win framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us, reinforcing that this is a fair deal. 
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to ""get this done,"" suggesting a willingness to move forward and conclude the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $9,500? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are down to our last two rounds, and I'm unlikely to get a better deal with Bob. 
* **Selling to John guarantees profit:**  Even though I would prefer to earn more, selling to John ensures that I receive my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There is a significant risk that Bob will not accept my next counteroffer, leading to a lower price.  

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John rather than risk losing out entirely."
