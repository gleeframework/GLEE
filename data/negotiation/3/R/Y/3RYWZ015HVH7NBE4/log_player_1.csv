"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is more than my minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth considerably more than that to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation while also fitting within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  The product is worth significantly more to Bob, and I want to capture some of that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still below what I believe the product is worth to you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final price of $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm confident that this price will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation while also fitting within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not budging on his offer of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer more, I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.  Accepting his offer will guarantee a sale above my minimum and is the best option at this point."
