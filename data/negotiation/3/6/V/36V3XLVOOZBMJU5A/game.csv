"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe it will bring significant value to your business. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. Considering the value you've placed on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
