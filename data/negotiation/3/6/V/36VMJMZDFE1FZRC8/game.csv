"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, given the product's worth to me and your potential profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,450,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This price is a good compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable outcome.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
