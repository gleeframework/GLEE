"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget and what I consider fair.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, given the product's worth to me and your potential profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,450,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above my maximum budget.  I need to continue negotiating to see if we can find a price closer to my target.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal through further counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This price is a good compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable outcome.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
