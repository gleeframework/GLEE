"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $180 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John is offering.  You should definitely counter-offer with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely and suggests that $100 is a more reasonable price from your perspective.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer aims to understand Alice's lower price limit and leaves space for further negotiation if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand it's a bit more than you were hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to your budget, $140 is still more than you want to spend, especially since you have John's offer of $120. There's room to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $110?  That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to signal we're looking for a good deal.
* **Justification:**  We're giving a reason for the counter-offer (""a bit more than I'm comfortable with"") to make it clear we have a budget in mind.
* **Clear Target:** By stating $110 ""would work,"" we're hinting that this price is acceptable and might be the final offer before considering John's deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $110 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and while $125 is slightly above your ideal price, it's only $5 more than John's offer. At this point, the potential time and effort of continuing the negotiation with Alice likely outweigh the small savings of buying from John."
