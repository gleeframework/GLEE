"While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for this product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this is a good deal.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend at this time.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
