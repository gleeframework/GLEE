"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. I understand it's a significant investment, but it offers immense value and potential. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further details.  If this isn't the right fit, I have another interested party who is willing to pay my asking price, so I'm confident in getting a good deal either way.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
