"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of offering $80 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet at $91.25 - that's just a small step closer to what I need, and I think it's a fair compromise.",91.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $91.25. I'm willing to go up to $90.50, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",90.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $90.50 just isn't enough for me.  How about we compromise at $91? This is my final offer, and it's a good price for both of us. What do you say?",91.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to try to make a deal. I'll meet you at $90, but that's my absolute final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll have to walk away.",90.0,Bob,8,
