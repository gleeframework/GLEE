"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her value than mine. I need to negotiate a lower price or consider buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60. Would that work for you?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice came down slightly, but it's still too high. I'll counter with a price closer to my limit, hoping she's willing to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I can't meet you at $90.  How about we settle around $70?  That's a fair offer considering my budget."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're interested in our product. Considering the value it holds, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $85? This is a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still aiming to pay less than $80.  One more counteroffer should make it clear whether a deal is possible with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to stretch my budget slightly and offer $75. That's the best I can do."",

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $80. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John to secure the product at my target price."
