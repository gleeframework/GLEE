Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers the safety net of $1,200,000,  getting Bob to pay even slightly above his perceived value significantly increases your profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message is crafted to create a sense of scarcity and value.  By mentioning a ""strong offer,"" we introduce a subtle pressure tactic without revealing John's full offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is high but leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling at a price point that's still very beneficial for you."
