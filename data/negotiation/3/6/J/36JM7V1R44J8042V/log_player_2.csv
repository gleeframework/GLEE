"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  A counteroffer of $7,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This aggressive counteroffer will hopefully prompt Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,200 is a good compromise, and Bob is likely to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. It's a good deal considering Bob is only willing to pay $15,000 maximum. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
