Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $80 gives me a strong fallback position and ensures I won't go below that price."
