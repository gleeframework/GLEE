"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and emphasizes the benefits of the deal for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I'm aiming to close with Bob, this offer keeps John as a backup option, ensuring I don't risk losing out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is necessary:** While I could sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I believe I can likely achieve a better price by continuing the discussion. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 rounds remaining, and I can potentially use this time to work towards a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue negotiating with you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns to maintain a positive tone and foster cooperation.
* **Clear Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product, suggesting that $900,000 is a fair price for both parties.
* **Openness to Further Negotiation:** I leave the door open for further negotiation, suggesting that we can potentially reach an agreement if he's willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his response and adjust my strategy accordingly, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum while keeping John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 that I need to make this deal worthwhile.
* **Opportunity for higher offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has demonstrated a willingness to increase his offer. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Time remaining:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating without risking a significant loss.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll also emphasize the value of the product and the potential benefits of reaching an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $850,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I truly believe this product will be extremely valuable to you, and this price reflects its potential.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm but Flexible:** I'm refusing Bob's offer but also demonstrating flexibility by lowering my counteroffer. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and the potential benefits for him. This reinforces the value proposition and may encourage him to raise his offer again.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  I'm aiming for a compromise that balances my needs with Bob's budget constraints. $950,000 is a reasonable price considering the product's value and Bob's previous willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, fostering a sense of partnership rather than confrontation. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his response to determine his true bottom line.  I will then decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer, based on the remaining time and potential for a successful outcome with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $800,000, so I hope we can meet in the middle soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is increasing his offer, $825,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer is tempting:** The fact that Bob is considering buying from John at $800,000 shows the pressure is increasing, but I still have leverage.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the time pressure is rising, but I believe there's still a chance to get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, but this time I'll be more aggressive. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,000,000, emphasizing the product's value and the fact that his offer is still not close enough to my minimum.  I'll also try to understand his budget constraints better to see if there's any room for further negotiation. If this doesn't work, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 simply doesn't work for me. It's clear we both value this product highly, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but  $900,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer.  I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of investing in it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum but framing it as a ""meeting halfway"" compromise to appeal to Bob's desire for fairness.
* **Emphasizing Value & Potential:**  I reiterate the product's value and potential, reminding Bob of its potential impact on his business.
* **Ultimatum (but not too harsh):** I mention John's offer to add urgency without being overly aggressive.  
* **Hopeful but Prepared:** I end on a positive note, expressing confidence that we can find a solution while acknowledging the possibility of selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyzing Bob's Response:** This is a critical round. I'll closely analyze Bob's reaction and determine his true bottom line. 
* **Prepared for a Deal or Rejection:** If Bob accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to make a decision about selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to protect your investment, but I'm not willing to go above $825,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet at $825,000 or is that still not possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to our last two rounds. 
* **No further negotiation:** Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to go above $825,000.  
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This is a much better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower price or losing the deal altogether.

**Final Decision:** While I'm disappointed that we couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, selling to John is the best option at this point. It guarantees me a fair price and allows me to move on."
