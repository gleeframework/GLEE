"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $50 is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum value of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which might encourage him to come up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still too low. I'm not willing to sell it for that price, and it's getting close to the point where selling to John for $150 might be a better option. I'll try one more counteroffer, but if that fails, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $160. This is a compromise, and it's still above my minimum price. I'm hoping that Bob sees that I'm willing to negotiate and will come up with a better offer. If not, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging on his low offers. It's becoming clear that he's not willing to pay a fair price for the product. At this point, it's better for me to sell to John for $150. This is a reasonable price, and I'll avoid further frustration with Bob's unrealistic offers."
