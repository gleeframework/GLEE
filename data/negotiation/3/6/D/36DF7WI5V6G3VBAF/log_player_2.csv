"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range.  While Bob could try to push for an even lower price, accepting the offer ensures a deal within a reasonable price range and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  It's also important to remember that John is selling the same product for $1,500,000, making this a good opportunity to secure a better deal with Alice."
