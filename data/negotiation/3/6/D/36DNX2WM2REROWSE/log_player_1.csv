Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it also leaves room for further counteroffers.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also highlights the potential value to him.

**Strategy:**

This starting point allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, I've achieved a decent profit.
* **Initiate negotiation:** If he rejects, it opens the door for counteroffers and allows me to assess his willingness to pay.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By having John as a backup buyer, I have the option to walk away if the negotiations don't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $950,000 for the product? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my ideal.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and push the price higher.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price. This will encourage him to consider a higher price in the next round.  

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price,  likely around $1,100,000. This will show a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm setting my counteroffer at $1,100,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept a price significantly below my value. 
* **Message:**  The message is polite but firm. It acknowledges Bob's counteroffer while reiterating my desired price point and emphasizing the value of the product.  

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** It keeps the price higher than Bob's initial offer, giving me a stronger negotiating position.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** It demonstrates a willingness to reach a deal while still protecting my interests.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  It encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially raise his offer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the value you place on the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being mindful of my budget constraints. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, I need to weigh the potential of further negotiations against the risk of losing the deal entirely. Considering John is willing to buy at $1,200,000, I'm taking a calculated risk by accepting this offer, but it's a significant profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could reject and try to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, and I have to consider the time and effort involved. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting, there's a chance Bob will walk away completely, leaving me with nothing.

**Overall, accepting this offer allows me to secure a good profit with minimal risk.**"
