Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down considerably, her ""final offer"" of $925,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $800,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and even if she budges a little, it's unlikely to be a difference worth passing up the sure savings with John."
