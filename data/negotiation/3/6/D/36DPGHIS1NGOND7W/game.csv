"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the value, Alice.  While it's a great product, $1,050,000 is still pushing my limits.  Could we agree on $750,000?  That's a significant investment on my end, but I'm willing to make it if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I still think $750,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
