Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're very close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'll meet you at $11,000, which is my initial offer, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a free accessory that's worth $500. What do you think?

While not ideal, Alice offering a $500 accessory softens the blow of not getting the price lower.  At this point, the difference between her offer and John's is small enough that the free accessory makes Alice's deal better."
