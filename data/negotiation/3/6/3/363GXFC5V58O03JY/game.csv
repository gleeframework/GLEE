"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9200, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I want to make a deal happen. How about we meet at $9500 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8900, Bob. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm willing to meet you at $9300, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",9300.0,Alice,9,
