,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings for you compared to selling to John.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still represents a significant savings for you compared to your alternative options. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal. Let's work together to find a solution.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $1,100,000 is not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This price is fair considering the value you'll be getting and the limited time we have to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,150,000. This price reflects a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's close this deal before we run out of time.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting, and it gives us both a chance to finalize this deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
