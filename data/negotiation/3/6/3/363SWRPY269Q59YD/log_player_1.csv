"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Opportunity Highlight:** I'm presenting the deal as a good opportunity for Bob to acquire a valuable product. 

This approach aims to get the negotiation started while setting a strong initial position. I'm willing to adjust my price based on Bob's response, but I'm confident that I can secure a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential savings for you compared to selling to John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting My Value:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a potential buyer provides me with a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and create an opportunity to potentially secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still represents a significant savings for you compared to your alternative options. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price from $1,750,000 to $1,300,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the savings Bob can achieve by purchasing from me compared to his other options. 
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I'm emphasizing a desire for a mutually beneficial solution.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and create momentum towards a deal. By meeting Bob halfway, I'm hoping to encourage him to reconsider his position and potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still too low.  I need to maintain my stance and continue negotiating to secure a more favorable deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting My Value:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Limited Time:** We are already in Round 4, and time is running out.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option if I can't secure a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and pressure Bob to increase his offer further. I believe there is still room for negotiation and hope to reach a deal that is more beneficial to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $1,100,000 is not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This price is fair considering the value you'll be getting and the limited time we have to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  I'm not willing to drop my price significantly. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the limited time available to reach a deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm remaining positive and hopeful to encourage a resolution.

This counteroffer aims to nudge Bob towards a price closer to my minimum acceptable price while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone. The emphasis on time pressure could potentially motivate Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,150,000. This price reflects a significant savings for you compared to selling to John, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's close this deal before we run out of time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,150,000 is close to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm unwilling to settle for less, particularly with John as a backup option.

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting My Value:**  Accepting Bob's offer would still result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Limited Time:**  We are already in Round 6, and time is running out. However, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable option if I can't get a better offer from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and pressure Bob to increase his offer further. I believe there's still room for negotiation and hope to reach a deal that's more beneficial to me."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,250,000.
