,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $95, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $100? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
