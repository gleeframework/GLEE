I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  I believe the product is worth more than $1,500,000, and Bob may be willing to pay a premium.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, which gives me leverage to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

If Bob accepts, I earn a greater profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum desired amount."
