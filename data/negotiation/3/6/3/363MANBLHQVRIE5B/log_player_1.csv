Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above my minimum price of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a potential $100,000 gain, a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and not risk losing out on the deal. 

By starting high, but leaving Bob with a potential profit margin, I increase the chances of securing a price significantly higher than my fallback offer from John."
