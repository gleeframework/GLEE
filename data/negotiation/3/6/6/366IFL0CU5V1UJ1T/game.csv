"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my best price, and I hope it's a starting point for a productive negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
