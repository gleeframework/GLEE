# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate, but there's still room for a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
