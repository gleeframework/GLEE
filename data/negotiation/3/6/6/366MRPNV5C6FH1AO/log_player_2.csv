Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a deal that works for you, but $900,000 simply doesn't meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see at least $1,200,000 to make this work for me. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm seeing that we're getting closer.  However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to raise your offer. However, $950,000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is close to the $800,000 mark he is willing to pay and can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations.
