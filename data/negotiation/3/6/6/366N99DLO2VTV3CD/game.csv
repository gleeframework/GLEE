"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This still allows you a substantial profit margin.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
