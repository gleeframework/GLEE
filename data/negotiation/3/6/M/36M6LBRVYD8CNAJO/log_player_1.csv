"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This gives me room to negotiate and still achieve a price closer to my desired value while also gauging his seriousness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum threshold. I want to try and push for a higher price and see if Bob is truly serious about the purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While the offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to drop that low yet. I'm holding out for a slightly higher price, hoping Bob will come up. There are still rounds left, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time to my minimum threshold. I'm signaling that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I won't go any lower. This is a good compromise that allows for potential agreement while also protecting my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers, and his latest offer is below my minimum threshold. We've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum desired price, and I can't risk further rounds with Bob. I'm choosing to sell to John."
