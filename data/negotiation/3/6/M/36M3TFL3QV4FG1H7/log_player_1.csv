Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of your product. However, considering my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too low, considering the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
