,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of your product. However, considering my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $1200000 is still below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I've reviewed my budget constraints once again and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. I hope this proposal is more aligned with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1300000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1325000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to maximize my return.  Let me know if you're interested.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I see your point, Alice. After further consideration, I'm prepared to offer $1310000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value and my budget constraints.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and accept $1315000. It's just a small increase, and I believe it's a fair price for a product with this much potential.  Let's close this deal!",1315000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I'm willing to offer $1312500 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions.",1312500.0,Bob,8,
