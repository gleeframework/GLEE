"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $500000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I need to be more realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a generous offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline. I am still looking for a price closer to my budget of $500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and quality.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
