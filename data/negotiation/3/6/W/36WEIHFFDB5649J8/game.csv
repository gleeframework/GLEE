"Thanks for the offer Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,875?  This feels like a fair price considering both of our positions.",9875.0,Bob,4,
