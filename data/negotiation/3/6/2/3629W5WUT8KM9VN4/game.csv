"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I know this product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  Consider this your exclusive opportunity to acquire it for $1,100,000.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at a lower price.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
