"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $825,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. That's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $800,000, Bob. However, I've already had another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay the full $800,000. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $820,000. This is my final offer above $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While I'm still willing to negotiate, Alice has mentioned another buyer willing to pay the same price as John.  This indicates that it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal with Alice.  It's more efficient to secure the product from John at my target price."
