"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm confident this product will bring significant value to you, and I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $1,350,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product will bring you. Let's close this deal, I believe it will be mutually beneficial.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of offering $1,325,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
