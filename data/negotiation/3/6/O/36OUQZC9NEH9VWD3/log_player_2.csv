"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially save more money by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $13,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget.  It demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still within my budget and a good compromise. Accepting this offer saves me $3,000 compared to buying from John and puts me in a better position than my initial counteroffer.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
