"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's target of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. While $11,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to compromise and offer $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for my business, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. It's still a great value for your business, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but Alice is still a bit high.  While a counteroffer might result in a lower price, it's getting late in the negotiation.  The risk of not getting a deal with Alice is increasing.  To guarantee the purchase of the product and avoid further rounds of negotiation, Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
