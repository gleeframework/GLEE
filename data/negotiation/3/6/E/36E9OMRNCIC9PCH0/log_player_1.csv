Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, highlighting it as a ""win-win"" situation. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I clearly express my willingness to negotiate, inviting Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, aiming to reach a price closer to my target. 
* I'll keep the backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's more favorable for me.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to reach a compromise between our current positions. 
* I will keep the option of selling to John in mind as a backup plan."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm open to negotiation,  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a compromise price of $1,150,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm still using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Emphasizing the value for Bob:** I remind Bob that $1,150,000 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's value.
* **Open to compromise:** I express a willingness to find common ground, signaling that I'm still flexible.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further if necessary.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess the situation carefully. If his next counteroffer is still too low, I'll likely move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result:**  At this point, it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  There's a significant gap between our desired prices.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Given the circumstances, selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get the minimum value I'm seeking.

**Next Steps:**

* I will reach out to John and finalize the sale for $1,500,000. This ensures a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
