{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. It also sets a positive tone, highlighting the value of the product. This strategy aims to encourage Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still secure a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? That's a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. While I would prefer to sell to John for $12,000, it is still a significant profit for me and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations that may not result in a higher offer. Accepting Bob's offer allows for a quick and profitable transaction."
