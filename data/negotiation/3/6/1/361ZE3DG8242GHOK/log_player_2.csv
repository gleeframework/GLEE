"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in it and allows for some room for negotiation. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value justifies a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you see in it, and it's still a significant discount from the original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  While I see the value of this product, I can't justify spending that much.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step for me and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000, as that's the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm offering it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my price point, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'll make a counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down even further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,000,000. Considering we're getting close, I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm offering it to you for $980,000, which is a 2% discount from my previous offer. This is my final concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is getting closer but it seems like she's unlikely to go below $980,000. I'm not willing to pay that much and I'm out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000."
