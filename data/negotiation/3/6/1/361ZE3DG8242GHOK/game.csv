"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in it and allows for some room for negotiation. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value justifies a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you see in it, and it's still a significant discount from the original offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  While I see the value of this product, I can't justify spending that much.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step for me and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000, as that's the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'm offering it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,000,000. Considering we're getting close, I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm offering it to you for $980,000, which is a 2% discount from my previous offer. This is my final concession, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",980000.0,Alice,7,
