"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1600000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1600000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, Bob, but $1000000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value I know the product holds, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1400000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to drive the price down, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle on this one. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
