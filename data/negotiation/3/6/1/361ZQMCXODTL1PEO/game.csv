"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. How about we settle on $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $11,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",11250.0,Bob,6,
