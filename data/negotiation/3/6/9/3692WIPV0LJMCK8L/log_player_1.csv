Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a good profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** $120 is a good starting point. It's more than my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good deal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob while also highlighting the potential profit for me. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I'll stick to my minimum of $80, knowing I have a backup buyer in John."
