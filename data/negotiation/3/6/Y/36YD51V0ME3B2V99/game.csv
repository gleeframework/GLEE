"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. This price reflects the value to me and allows you a decent profit. What do you say?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $775,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll derive from the product and the profit I'll make. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
