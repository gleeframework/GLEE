Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
