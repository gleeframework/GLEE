"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and its potential benefits for you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it will bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there.  $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value of the product to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer the product for $1,012,500. This price reflects the value of the product to me while also showing my willingness to work with you.  I'm hopeful we can reach a deal in the next few rounds.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $990,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.",990000.0,Bob,6,
