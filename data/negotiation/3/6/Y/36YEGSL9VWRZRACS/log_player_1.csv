"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and its potential benefits for you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. It's worth trying to push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there.  $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value of the product to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 more rounds to negotiate with him. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and offer the product for $1,012,500. This price reflects the value of the product to me while also showing my willingness to work with you.  I'm hopeful we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $990,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to 4 rounds left, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm worried that we might not be able to close a deal at a price I'm comfortable with. Since John is offering me my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid the risk of losing money or not closing the deal with Bob."
