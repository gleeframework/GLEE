"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a serious offer and it's as high as I can go right now.  I hope you'll consider it.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is the lowest price I can consider. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
