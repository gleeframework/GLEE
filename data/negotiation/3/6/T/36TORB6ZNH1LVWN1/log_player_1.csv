"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, knowing it's more than Bob values it at. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the product's value to build rapport. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, which keeps the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $100, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $95 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing the price from $110 to $95. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum of $100, and gives me room to potentially negotiate further.
* **Positive framing:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get at this price, making it seem like a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We're in the middle of the negotiation process, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $92 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Finality:** I'm signaling that this might be my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us, making it seem like a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $91. This is a fair price considering we've both come down a bit. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $91 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited rounds:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a sale.
* **Potential to maximize:** While I could potentially get $92, there's no guarantee. $91 is a good compromise and a secure sale."
