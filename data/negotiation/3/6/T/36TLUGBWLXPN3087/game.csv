"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
