"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message leaves the door open for discussion and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $9,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I have 8 more rounds to try and get closer to my target price. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  While John's offer of $12,000 is enticing, I want to explore if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're looking to save money. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $9,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language (""fair deal"", ""reflects the product's value"") to keep the conversation amicable and emphasize mutual benefit.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. Can you consider $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my target:** While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since I have 6 rounds left. 
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  I'm not willing to settle for less than $12,000, but John's offer provides a secure backup option if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,400.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while still respecting the value of this product.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the Compromise:**  I'm staying consistent with my strategy of meeting Bob halfway, showing that I'm genuinely interested in a deal. 
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency by suggesting they ""close the deal"".
* **Positive Language:**  I continue to use positive language (""fair compromise"") to keep the tone friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,300 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, even though we're getting closer.
* **Only four rounds left:**  While the negotiation is progressing, I have limited rounds left to reach my desired price.
* **John's offer is secure:**  If I can't reach an agreement with Bob in the remaining rounds, I can confidently sell to John for $12,000. 

I'm going to hold out for a better offer, as I'm confident that I can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I understand your need to save, but I'm firm on $9,350. This reflects a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs. Let's make this happen, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm only going up by $50 this time, showing I'm willing to be flexible but still holding firm on my minimum price.
* **Reinforcing Agreement:**  I reiterate that we're ""getting close"" to remind Bob we're on the verge of a deal.
* **Finality:**  I emphasize that this is a ""fair price"" and it's time to ""make this happen,"" subtly suggesting this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $9,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,300 and $9,350. Can you consider $9,325? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,325. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,325
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the chances of getting a significantly higher offer from Bob are slim.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I'm confident that John will purchase the product for $12,000, which is significantly more than what Bob is offering.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd ideally get closer to my initial goal, there's too much risk in continuing to negotiate with Bob when a guaranteed and much better offer exists.  I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer. 

It's a smart business decision to take the secure offer and close the deal with John."
