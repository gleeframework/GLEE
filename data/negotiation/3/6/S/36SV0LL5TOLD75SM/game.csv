"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
