"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been highly valued by previous customers. I believe it's worth more than its cost, and I'm confident it will provide significant benefits to you. For this opportunity, I am offering the product at $200. I hope you find this price fair and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far above your maximum price of $120. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value. However, $200 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $150 for the product. This is a reasonable midpoint between our initial offers, and I believe it will allow us to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is closer to your maximum, it's still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I am willing to accept $125 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the item while also accommodating your budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There are 5 rounds remaining and you can always fall back on John's offer if needed.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still slightly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $120, which is my absolute limit.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued patience and understanding, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $122 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and aims to bring us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this offer is getting closer, you're only two rounds away from being able to purchase the product from John for a lower price. Continue negotiating to see if you can get Alice down to your $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. However,  $122 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $120, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price. After further reflection, I am willing to accept $121 for the product. This is a compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction while staying within your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You have one round remaining. Although Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it's likely she won't come down to $120. Since you can buy the same product from John for $120, it's more advantageous to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase from John."
