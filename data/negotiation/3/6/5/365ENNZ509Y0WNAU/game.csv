,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value. However, $200 is above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $100 at this time. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $150 for the product. This is a reasonable midpoint between our initial offers, and I believe it will allow us to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I am willing to accept $125 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the item while also accommodating your budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still slightly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $120, which is my absolute limit.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued patience and understanding, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $122 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and aims to bring us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",122.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. However,  $122 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $120, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",120.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price. After further reflection, I am willing to accept $121 for the product. This is a compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction while staying within your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.",121.0,Alice,9,
