"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1100000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and pay $1050000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1150000. Can you consider this final offer?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making one more concession, Alice, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1120000 for the product, which is my final offer. Can you consider it?",1120000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made several concessions. I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $1150000. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. My final offer stands at $1150000. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
