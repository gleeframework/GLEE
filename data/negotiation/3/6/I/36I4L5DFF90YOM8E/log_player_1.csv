Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is more than your minimum, but still attractive to Bob as it is less than what the product is worth to him. This allows for potential negotiation space and opens the door for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than the initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and given the risk of Bob walking away completely, accepting his offer is the best strategy in this scenario."
