"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
