"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this is the best price I can offer. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at this price. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
