"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better. He has 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to settle immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's much lower than Alice's initial offer. This sets the tone for negotiation and shows Bob's willingness to bargain.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he still has time to negotiate further. He can likely get the price down even lower, especially considering Alice has already rejected his counteroffer.  It's too early to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is slightly higher than his previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that he is willing to compromise, but also that he is confident he can get a better deal.  This move increases the pressure on Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, he's still got time to negotiate further and there's no reason to rush into an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer but still pushing for a lower price.  By increasing his offer by a smaller amount this time, he shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. He's also increasing the pressure on Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's desired price, and it's getting late in the negotiations.  With only three rounds left, it's a good idea for Bob to accept the offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that he might lose the deal entirely or end up paying more if Alice refuses to budge."
