"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves you with a significant profit.  This allows for some negotiation room while still reflecting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is still a good profit for you, you can likely do better.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you show that you're not desperate to sell and that you value the product.  This sets the stage for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $11,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $12,000 is the best fit for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is close to John's offer, it's still worth pushing for a bit more.  Rejecting Bob's offer again shows your commitment to getting the best deal possible, and keeps the negotiation going. You still have 6 rounds left, and there's a chance Bob might concede further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $11,500?  That's closer to your offer, and still a good value for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is only slightly above John's offer, it's still a better deal than selling to John.  You've already gone through several rounds and there's a chance Bob might not budge further. It's better to secure the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's offer."
