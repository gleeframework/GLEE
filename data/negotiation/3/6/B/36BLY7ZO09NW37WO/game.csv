"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000, which is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, considering its potential value to me. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value it holds for me, while also being more in line with your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I have in the product, but it's also a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'm still not quite there with $1,050,000. Let's try $975,000. This is a fair compromise that shows my seriousness about acquiring the product while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
