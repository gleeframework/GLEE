You have three options:

The product is too expensive at $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm serious about making a deal.  I hope Alice sees this as a reasonable offer and accepts."
