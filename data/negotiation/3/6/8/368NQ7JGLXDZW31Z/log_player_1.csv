Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,250,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer, further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap quickly enough. It's time to move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
