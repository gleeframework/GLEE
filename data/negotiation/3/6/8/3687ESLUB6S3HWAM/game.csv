"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm starting at $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500, which is still a discount from my original offer. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the discount you're offering.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $11000 for the product. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $9000, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",9000.0,Bob,6,
