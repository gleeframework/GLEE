Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering a higher price initially, you can gauge Bob's level of interest. If he readily accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you have space to lower the price.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80 gives you leverage.  You're not desperate to sell to Bob, allowing you to hold firmer on price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you value a quick sale, you could adjust your initial offer."
