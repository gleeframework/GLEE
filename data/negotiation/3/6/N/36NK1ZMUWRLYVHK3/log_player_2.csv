Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $10,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $10,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly holding firm at a price above your maximum budget. While she might come down slightly in further rounds, it's unlikely she'll reach your target of $10,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at that price, so it's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the deal with John."
