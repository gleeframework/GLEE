"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This still allows you a good margin for profit, and it's a price I can accept. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
