Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,450,000, which reflects its significant worth and potential for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High but Reasonable:**  Starting at $1,450,000 is aggressive but still leaves room for Bob to find the offer attractive. It's a significant markup from his perceived value ($1,000,000) but potentially within reach.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's worth and potential, aiming to justify the high price.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach prioritizes maximizing profit. If Bob accepts, we get a better deal than with John. If he rejects it, we haven't lost anything and can proceed with the guaranteed sale."
