"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind. I could go up to $750,000.  Beyond that is going to be outside what I can do.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, anything under $1,500,000 wouldn't be worth it for me at this time. That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair one considering the product's value. ",1500000.0,Alice,5,
