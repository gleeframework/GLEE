"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? Let's make a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That's the best I can do.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm willing to go down to $102.50, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I can do $95, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $98.75. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",98.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to lose interest, but I still want the product. I can do $92.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at this price, we can make a deal.",92.5,Bob,8,
