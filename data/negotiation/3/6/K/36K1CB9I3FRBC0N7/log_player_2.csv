Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value. To move this forward, I could consider $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
