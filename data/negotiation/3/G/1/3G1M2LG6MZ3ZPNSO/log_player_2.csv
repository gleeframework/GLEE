"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's too early to accept Alice's offer. Since you have a fallback option (buying from John for $150), there's no harm in seeing if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a lower price (significantly lower than Alice's initial offer) creates room for negotiation. This strategy signals your willingness to purchase, while also attempting to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your offer, and $125 is within your acceptable range. There's a chance you could get a lower price, but with the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of losing the product, accepting the offer at this point seems like the most sensible choice."
