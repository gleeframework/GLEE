"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! Unfortunately, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for my product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $140 is closer, but still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do $110?  That would be a great price for me.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
