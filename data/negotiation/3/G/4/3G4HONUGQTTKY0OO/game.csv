"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, while still allowing me to receive a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still not acceptable to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 as a final compromise.  This price represents a significant concession on my part and ensures both of us get a fair deal. Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
