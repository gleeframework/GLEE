"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice's offer is $140, which is better than John's price of $150.
* However, you can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and hoping she'll lower her price. 
* Since you have a fallback option with John, there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer."
