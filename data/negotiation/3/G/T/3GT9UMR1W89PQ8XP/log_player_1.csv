{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $500 buffer allows for some back and forth without me feeling pressured to accept a low offer right away.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message builds rapport and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I believe I can get closer to my target by rejecting and counter-offering.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:**  Selling to John right now would mean leaving $500 on the table, which is better than selling for a price that's below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm counter-offering with a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language to keep the negotiation going and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower offer from Bob, potentially pushing me below my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of going lower or selling to John at a lower price is not worth the potential gain of a few hundred dollars.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice in this situation."
