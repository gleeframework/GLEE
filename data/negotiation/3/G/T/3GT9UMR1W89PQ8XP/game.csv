"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,
