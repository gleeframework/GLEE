"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let me know if you're interested!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13000? That's still a fair price considering the value it offers.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really looking for something closer to $12000.  Is there any way we can meet in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,4,
