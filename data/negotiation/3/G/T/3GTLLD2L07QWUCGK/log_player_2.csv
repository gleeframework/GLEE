"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for cheaper from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13000? That's still a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for cheaper from John. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further, but he shouldn't settle for anything above $12,000 yet."
