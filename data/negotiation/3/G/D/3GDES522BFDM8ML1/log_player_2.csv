"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice's offer is a decent price, but it's still higher than what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, there's a chance Alice might come back with a lower price, getting you a better deal."
