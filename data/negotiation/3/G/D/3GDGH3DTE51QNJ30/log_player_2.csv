"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is lower than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John at $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John and save $100,000."
