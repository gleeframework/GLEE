"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to sell it for $100.  That's a good price for both of us, and it's still above my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price. There's no benefit to further negotiation or buying from John."
