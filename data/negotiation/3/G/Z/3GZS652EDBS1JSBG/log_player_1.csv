Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate if necessary. It's important to start high and see what Bob's reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $13,000 is still too low, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to meet in the middle and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $13,500 isn't my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm getting closer to my goal of $15,000.  It's also worth noting that continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
