Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000.,1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1400000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1325000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1325000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that respects both our positions. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1300000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1310000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
