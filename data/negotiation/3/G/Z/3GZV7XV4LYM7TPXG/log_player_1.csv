Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since the product's value to Bob matches your minimum, there's room to negotiate.  Starting high allows you to potentially secure a price significantly above your baseline.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value might even exceed the asking price, subtly encouraging Bob to consider the potential benefits and justifying the high number. 
* **Backup plan:** You have the safety net of John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the offer attractive enough that Bob might accept it outright."
