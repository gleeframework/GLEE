Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in your product's value. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief justification (""Given its value..."") can make your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and keep the negotiation going. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.
* You have a strong fallback position with John, so don't feel pressured to accept an offer below your minimum."
