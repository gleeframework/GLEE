Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $12,000 is less than Bob's value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's open-ended:**  The message leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, encouraging continued negotiation. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation in a way that maximizes your potential profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is higher than John's offer of $10,000, it's still below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  $10,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Positive language:** The message focuses on the value of the product and the benefit to Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  

* **Time is a factor:**  Negotiations are taking time, and I don't want to risk Bob further lowering his offer or delaying the sale.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  John is ready to buy immediately for $10,000, which is both my minimum and a guaranteed profit.

Therefore, it's more efficient and less risky to sell the product to John right now."
