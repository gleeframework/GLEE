"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a price of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its value. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
