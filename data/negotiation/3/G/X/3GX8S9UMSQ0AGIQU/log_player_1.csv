Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its value. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
