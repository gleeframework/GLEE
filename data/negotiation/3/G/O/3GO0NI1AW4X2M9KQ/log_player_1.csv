""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Find a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,000,000 (Bob's value) is unlikely to be accepted as you'd get nothing from the deal.  Setting the price too close to $1,500,000 increases the chance Bob will reject it.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a price potentially attractive enough to consider. It creates a win-win scenario where Bob gets the product for less than your minimum, and you earn more than your guaranteed sale price."
