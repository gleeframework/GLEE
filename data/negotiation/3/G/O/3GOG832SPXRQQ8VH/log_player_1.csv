Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to my true value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting me closer to my desired profit.
* **Appear Reasonable:** While I could start higher, a price too close to $150 might immediately scare Bob away. This offer balances my interests with a price that could seem reasonable to him."
