"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you know you can buy the same product from John for $100, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at the same price. By rejecting, you leave open the possibility of Alice lowering her price to get a sale."
