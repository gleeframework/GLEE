"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the quality and potential of what I'm offering. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be worth $6,000 at most for me. I can offer you $6,500 hoping we can close the deal quickly.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $6,500 is significantly below its true value.  This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $7,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering I could go with a different seller.",7000.0,Bob,4,
