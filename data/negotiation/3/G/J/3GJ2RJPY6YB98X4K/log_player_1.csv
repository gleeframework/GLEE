Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's a significant discount from your minimum value of $15,000, making it tempting for Bob.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It emphasizes a win-win scenario, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **This strategy aims to:**
    * Secure a price above Bob's perceived value while still leaving room for negotiation.
    * Quickly gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
    *  If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer or move on to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 is too low:**  It's below your minimum value and doesn't provide enough profit margin.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer indicates he's interested, so there's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  John's offer is your best-case scenario, but it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control and can explore options for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a significant discount from my original price.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** $10,500 is a compromise between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:** This price still allows you to profit from the sale, while being more appealing to Bob than your original offer.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties. 

This counteroffer aims to:

*  Show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
*  Keep the negotiation moving forward.
*  Increase the likelihood of a deal while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good compromise:** While it's still below your ideal price, it's close enough to your minimum value and represents a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to haggle may risk losing Bob entirely and forcing you to sell to John for a lower price. 
* **Time is a factor:** The longer the negotiation drags on, the greater the chance of unforeseen complications or a better offer appearing for John.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit, minimizing potential risks and delays."
