"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's something you value at $15000, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still very fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $14000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  $14,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **It's still a good deal:** While Bob could buy from John for $15,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him $1,000."
