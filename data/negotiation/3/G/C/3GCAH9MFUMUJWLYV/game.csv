"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $1,350,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this. ",1450000.0,Alice,5,
