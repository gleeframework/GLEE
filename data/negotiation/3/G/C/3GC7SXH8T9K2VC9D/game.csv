"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $9000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10000? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $9500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9500 is still unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This represents a significant discount for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable solution, as I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $10000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
