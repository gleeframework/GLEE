Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $9000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10000? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
