Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth so much more than that to me. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $14000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $12000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll make one more offer: I'll sell it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll make one more offer: I'll sell it to you for $13000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but I'm not budging from that price. If you're not willing to sell at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,8,
