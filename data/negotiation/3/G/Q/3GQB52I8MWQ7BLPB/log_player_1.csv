Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate.  It's important to remember:

* **I need to earn at least $800,000.** So any offer lower than that is unacceptable. 
* **I don't know Bob's value.**  He could be willing to pay more than $1 million! Starting high gives me leverage.
* **I have a backup buyer.** This means I'm not desperate to sell, which makes me less likely to cave to Bob's counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I won't accept anything below $800,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good amount of money, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for less than my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm coming down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will finally see that this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I've already made significant compromises, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to move on and take the guaranteed offer from John."
