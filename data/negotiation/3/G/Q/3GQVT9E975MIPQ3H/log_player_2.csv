"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is less than the product's worth to her, you can get it for $100 from John.  You maximize your savings by going with John."
