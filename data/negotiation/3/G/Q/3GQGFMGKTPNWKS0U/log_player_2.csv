"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. I think it's a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price.  This gives Alice a reason to negotiate while also demonstrating Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $11,000? It's a competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better offer than John's, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while staying within his budget. The offer of $10,750 is closer to Alice's previous offer of $11,000, signaling a willingness to compromise. It's also still lower than what Bob would pay from John, keeping the potential for a good deal alive."
