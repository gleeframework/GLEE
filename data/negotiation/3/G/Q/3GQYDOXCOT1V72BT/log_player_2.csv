Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500? That's a good compromise for both of us, wouldn't you agree?  Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7,750 is still too far from my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250.

Alice is very slowly coming down in price and we are getting close to the maximum budget.  It's unlikely she'll go below $8,000 so it's better to take the guaranteed deal from John."
