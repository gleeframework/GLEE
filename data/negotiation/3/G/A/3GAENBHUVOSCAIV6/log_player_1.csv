I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my original asking price, I've reached a point where it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. John is offering a price that's significantly closer to my value, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that opportunity."
