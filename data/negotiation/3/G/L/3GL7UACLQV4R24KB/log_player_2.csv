"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $140 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $135 is less than Bob's maximum of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob already offered $130 and Alice only countered with $135.  Further negotiation might not lead to a significantly lower price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers or that John might not be available later.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is still within Bob's budget and potentially saves him time and effort compared to further negotiation."
