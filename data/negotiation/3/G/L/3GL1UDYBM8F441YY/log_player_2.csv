"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to me is even higher. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125?  This would be a fair compromise and I think it's a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than her current offer, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.  Buying from John ensures you stay within your budget."
