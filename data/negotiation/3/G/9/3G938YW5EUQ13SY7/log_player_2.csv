Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $4,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $5,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to compromise again and sell the product to you for $5,250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is consistently meeting in the middle. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results.  Accepting the $5,250 offer secures a good price."
