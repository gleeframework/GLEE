"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,200,001. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200001.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider a price of $1,100,000, which is still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $1,050,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,065,000?",1065000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $1,065,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,090,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems like we're very close in our valuations. I'm willing to go up to $1,072,500, which is a very fair offer. Let's get this done!",1072500.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,085,000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. Let's finalize the deal and make it happen.",1085000.0,Alice,9,
