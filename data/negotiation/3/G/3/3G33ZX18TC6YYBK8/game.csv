"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle one more time at $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
