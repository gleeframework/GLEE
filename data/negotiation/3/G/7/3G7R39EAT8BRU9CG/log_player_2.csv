"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's discuss a fair price. My initial offer is $150. Thank you for considering this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point. There's potential for negotiation, and since you have 10 rounds, it's worth exploring if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've put on the product, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $150.  To start, I'm willing to offer $125. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $140 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations while still reflecting its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $140 is within my budget and represents a slight discount from her initial price. While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is higher with each round.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
