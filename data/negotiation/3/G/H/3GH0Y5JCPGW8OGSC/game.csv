"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to stay within your budget, and I respect that. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,750? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",8750.0,Bob,6,
