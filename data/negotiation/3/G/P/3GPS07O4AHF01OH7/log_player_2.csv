"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
 ""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and probes Alice's willingness to move down from her initial offer.
* **Not Insulting:** While low, $65 isn't ridiculously low. It shows I'm serious about buying but looking for a fair price. 
* **Gauging Alice:**  This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is on price. If she accepts immediately, I know I could have gone even lower. If she rejects it outright, I know I have more work to do to find a price we both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $77.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit in her offer, but $77.50 is still too high for me. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $70? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between my last offer ($65) and her current offer ($77.50). This shows a willingness to compromise while still working towards a price point that works for me. 
* **Clear Target:** By suggesting $70, I'm giving Alice a clear target.  It might be acceptable to her, or it might prompt her to counter with a slightly higher price, but still below her current offer.
* **Sense of Urgency (Slight):** As rounds progress, I might hint (subtly) that I'm considering other options if we can't reach an agreement soon. This might encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $75. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but I think there's still a bit more room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a little further, especially since she indicated it's ""getting close"" to her minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""You're getting close, Alice.  I'm happy to agree to $72 right now.  If that works for you, I'm ready to make this purchase!"",
 ""product_price"": 72
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** $72 represents another compromise, moving slightly closer to Alice's $75 while still holding on to some of my potential savings.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm making it clear that I'm ready to buy *now* at this price.  This implies that if Alice isn't willing to accept $72, I might start seriously considering my alternative option.
* **Final Offer (Implied):**  While not explicitly stating it's my ""final offer,"" the tone suggests this is a price I'm very comfortable with, and further negotiation might be unlikely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $73. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has come down to $73, which is a reasonable price and within my acceptable range. While I could try to push for $72, it's not worth the risk of her rejecting the offer and potentially losing the deal.
* **Time Investment:**  We've already spent several rounds negotiating.  The potential savings of $1 or $2 aren't worth the extra time and effort at this point. 
* **Avoid John:**  Buying from John would cost me $100. Accepting Alice's offer saves me $27 compared to that option."
