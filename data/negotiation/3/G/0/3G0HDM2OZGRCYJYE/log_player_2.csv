Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85.

You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for your maximum budget."
