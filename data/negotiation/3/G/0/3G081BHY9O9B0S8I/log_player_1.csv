Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 offer:** This is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive and friendly way to encourage Bob to consider it. 

By starting with this offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price. I'm also leaving room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum, especially since the product is worth $120 to him. I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. 
* **Positive messaging:** I'm still being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving a small amount of room for further negotiation, just in case Bob is still hesitant.

By making this counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $85 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Risk of losing a sale:** Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further negotiations and potentially a lower price, or even losing the sale altogether. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing valuable time and potentially the chance to sell to John at the same price.

Given the close proximity to my minimum and the risks associated with further negotiation, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
