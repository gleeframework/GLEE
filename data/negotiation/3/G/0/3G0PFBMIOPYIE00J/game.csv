"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford $8000 right now.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $10000, Bob. However, I'm still open to negotiating. I'm thinking of a price of $16000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand you're not happy with my last offer, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  I'm open to further negotiation, but this is the most I can do at this time.",12000.0,Bob,6,
