"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $20000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford $8,000 right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step down from her initial price, $18,000 is still above his budget. It's better to keep negotiating and see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $10000, Bob. However, I'm still open to negotiating. I'm thinking of a price of $16000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's another step down in price, $16,000 is still above his budget. He's already shown he's willing to walk away, so there's no reason to rush into a deal that doesn't work for him. It's better to keep negotiating with Alice or explore the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're not happy with my last offer, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  I'm open to further negotiation, but this is the most I can do at this time."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $14000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  John is offering the product at a price Bob can afford, and it's better to secure the product at a lower price than continue negotiating with Alice and risk her rejecting his next counteroffer."
