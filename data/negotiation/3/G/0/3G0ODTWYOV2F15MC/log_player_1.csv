Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing you a near-optimal price. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While a much lower price might tempt Bob, it's less likely to be taken seriously. A price slightly below your guaranteed value appears more reasonable and might encourage him to accept."
