Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to John ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer if he's interested. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I can potentially maximize my profits. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate and potentially settle for a price closer to John's offer if needed. This strategy balances my desire for profit with the risk of losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer. This means:

* **No further potential gain:** There's no chance of getting a higher price from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to Bob is the best option as it offers a guaranteed profit and eliminates any risk of losing the sale."
