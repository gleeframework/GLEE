"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value is $1,000,000 to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
