"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is still a bit rich for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
