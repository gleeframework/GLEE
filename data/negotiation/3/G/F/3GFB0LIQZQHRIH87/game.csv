"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise.  What do you say?",12800.0,Alice,5,
