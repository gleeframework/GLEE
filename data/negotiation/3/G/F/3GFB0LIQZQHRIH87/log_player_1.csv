{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than Bob's $12,000 valuation, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $14,000 is still above your $15,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth that might lead to a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, this is just a starting point. You'll need to be flexible and adaptable based on Bob's responses.  If he's too resistant to your offer, you can consider lowering it slightly, but be cautious about going too low! You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to take $11,500, it's important to remember that you can get a much better deal. 

You'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. This will give you a chance to try and meet somewhere in the middle, while still protecting your profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're not giving away the farm.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This gives Bob a sense of progress and encourages him to meet you halfway.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still making a decent profit at $13,000.

Remember, the key is to be flexible but firm. You want to reach a price that's acceptable to both of you, but you don't want to undervalue your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $12,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. You're very close to your minimum acceptable price and still have the option of selling to John for $15,000.  

It's important to stand your ground and continue negotiating.  You will send a counteroffer in the next round, attempting to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows your willingness to compromise.
* **It's lower than your previous offer:** This signals you're getting closer to a deal.
* **It's close to your minimum:** You're only $200 away from your minimum, and it's worth taking this risk to avoid selling to John.

If Bob rejects this offer, you should immediately move on to John to secure the $15,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision at that price. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $12,500 is below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to try and continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal and losing out on the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price is too great.

You will sell the product to John for $15,000 to maximize your profits."
