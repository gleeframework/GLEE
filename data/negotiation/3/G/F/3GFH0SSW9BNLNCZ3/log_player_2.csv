"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might make her propose a lower price, and if not, you can always buy from John for $120."
