Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more significant saving. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its value and the market rate. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While your offer is tempting, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  There are still 6 rounds left, so there's time to work out a deal."

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. However, we're running out of time. There are only 4 rounds left, and if we don't come to an agreement soon, I might have to consider selling to John for $1,000,000."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, Bob has repeatedly refused to budge on his offer. I've already made significant concessions, and it's unlikely he will accept a higher price.  I can't risk another round and potentially lose out on a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.  Selling to John is the best option at this point."
