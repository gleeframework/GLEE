Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product, worth no less than $1,500,000 to me.  I'm confident it will be of great value to you as well.  To begin, I'm offering it for $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'm not willing to accept that price just yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,600,000? It's a compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is just above my minimum value for the product and is a good compromise. While I'd like to get more, accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation. Selling to John would only get me $1,500,000, so this is a better outcome."
