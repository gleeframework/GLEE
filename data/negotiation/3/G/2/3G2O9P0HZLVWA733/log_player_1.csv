Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value,"" subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects it, you can always lower the price or move on to John.  If he counters, you'll know he's seriously interested.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly (or sell it to John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important:** Remember, you have a strong fallback option with John. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet you at a price that's beneficial for you."
