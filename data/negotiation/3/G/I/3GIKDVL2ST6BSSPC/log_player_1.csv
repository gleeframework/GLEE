Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that sets a high bar for negotiation.  While I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, this leaves room for negotiation and potentially earns me more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for $1,400,000. I will counter-offer to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price point that is closer to my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is only slightly lower than my guaranteed sale price with John. This is a good deal, as it is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer maximizes my profits."
