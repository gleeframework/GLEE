"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers your business. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
