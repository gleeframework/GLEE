Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds, and I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my goal.  I'm also confident that I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially close the deal with John for my minimum price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate further with Bob.  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  John is willing to buy the product for my desired price, and I can secure a guaranteed sale with him. It's not worth risking another round with Bob to potentially lose out on a better deal."
