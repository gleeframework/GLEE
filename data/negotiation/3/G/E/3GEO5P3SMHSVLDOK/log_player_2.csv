"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to get as close to his $10,000 limit as possible. Offering $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. 
* **Motivating Alice:** A lower offer might incentivize Alice to think about the value of selling to Bob versus potentially losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $10,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the door open to a better deal.  If Bob buys from John, he loses the potential to get an even better deal from Alice in later rounds.
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting, Bob signals his continued desire to negotiate and shows that he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a halfway point between Alice's last offer ($11,000) and Bob's last offer ($10,500).  It shows a commitment to reaching a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Moving closer to the target:** $10,750 is still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000, but it gets him closer to his goal.
* **Signal of seriousness:**  Offering a price higher than his previous offer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875.  This is a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still $875 above his target of $10,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to walk away, and with only 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is on Alice to make a more favorable offer.  There's still potential for a better deal. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating without losing the opportunity to secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go to $10,700,  which is still a bit more than my ideal price, but it shows my commitment to closing this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Bob is offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This also leaves some room for negotiation in case Alice rejects.
* **Pressure on Alice:** With only 4 rounds remaining, this counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to decide. Bob is signaling that he's serious about buying, but won't overpay.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial target, he's still strategically holding out for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $10,750. That's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer of $10,750 is only $750 above Bob's target price of $10,000. 
* **Limited time:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a higher price.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within a reasonable range of Bob's goal. 
* **Potential for future savings:**  Even if Bob could get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the savings might be minimal compared to the risk of not securing the product."
