{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's far too early to accept Alice's offer.  $500,000 is a great price, but there's a lot of room to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower before settling."

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by aiming for a significant discount. It's a bold move, but it might incentivize Alice to counter with a more reasonable price closer to your target range."

Alice has come down from $500,000 to $400,000, which is a positive sign. However, there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap further."

Alice is coming up slightly, but still significantly above my target price. I'm willing to keep negotiating for a better price. There's no need to rush into an agreement when I have a safety net with John's offer."

Alice is now only $25,000 away from my last offer, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more savings. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price, saving me a significant amount compared to buying from John."
