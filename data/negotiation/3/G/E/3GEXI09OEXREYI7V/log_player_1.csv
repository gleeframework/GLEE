Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still securing a profit above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""one-time offer"" aims to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the high price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. A more sophisticated approach might involve researching Bob's purchasing habits or the market value of similar products to tailor your offer."
