"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to purchase it.",825000.0,Alice,3,
