"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to keep expenses lower, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $11000 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm willing to go up to $11200, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11200.0,Alice,5,
