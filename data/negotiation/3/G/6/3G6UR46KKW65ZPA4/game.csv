"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This would still allow me to make a profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950000. This is a fair price, considering your initial asking price and my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer of $950000, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're almost there!  I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can afford.  If you're serious about selling, let's close this deal now.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
