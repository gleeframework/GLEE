"Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and it's worth $100 to you, right? I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $95.  Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. How about we split the difference and do $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need to get at least $92.50 for this. Let's make this happen!",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I can go a little higher, but $90 is the absolute best I can do.",90.0,Bob,6,
