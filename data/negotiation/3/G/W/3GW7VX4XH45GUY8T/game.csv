"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still offers you a substantial value, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this is a win-win solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Can you consider my revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
