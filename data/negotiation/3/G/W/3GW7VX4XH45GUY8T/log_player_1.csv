Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds great value for your business. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This price reflects the significant benefits and potential this product offers.  Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** This message emphasizes the value of the product and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  While I'm aiming to sell to Bob, having John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a higher price. 

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground. This will give me a better chance of closing the deal without sacrificing too much of my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still offers you a substantial value, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this is a win-win solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** $1,300,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a significant decrease from my initial $1,400,000 but still above Bob's $1,200,000.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's willingness to compromise and try to frame the counteroffer as a win-win solution, emphasizing the value the product still offers at this price.  
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm still mindful of John's offer of $1,500,000, which provides me with a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, it makes more sense to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This guarantees me the highest profit and saves me the time and effort of potentially going through more rounds of negotiations."
