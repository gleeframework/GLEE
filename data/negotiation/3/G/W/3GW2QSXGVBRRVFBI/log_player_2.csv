Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should counteroffer again to try and get a better deal."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Since Bob has a guaranteed way to get the product for $10,000 from John, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up paying more."
