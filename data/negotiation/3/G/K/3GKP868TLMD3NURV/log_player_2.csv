"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think it's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000).** This indicates she's willing to negotiate further.
* **$11,500 is a significant discount from the initial $12,000 offer.**  This is a good price for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **There's a risk that rejecting this offer could lead to a stalemate or a counteroffer that's too high.** It's better to secure a good deal than to risk losing out."
