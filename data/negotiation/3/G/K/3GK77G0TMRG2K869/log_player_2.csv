"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is a discount, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It makes more sense to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first. If she won't budge, you can always go with John's offer."
