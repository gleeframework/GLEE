Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to pay less. It also signals that you are serious about selling, but not desperate.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a bit low, but it's still better than selling to John. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer,  showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than I would like, it's only $500 less than my last offer.  I'm concerned that further negotiation might result in a lower offer, or I might end up selling to John for $10,000. It's better to secure a sale now and avoid risking a lower price."
