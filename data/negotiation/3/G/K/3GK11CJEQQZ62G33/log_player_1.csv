"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also setting a positive tone to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I have 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. I only have 6 rounds left and I believe I can negotiate a better price. I'll counter again to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's my final offer. Please consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John. 

We're down to the 6th round, and Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my minimum, but not quite there. I only have 4 rounds left to reach a better price.

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk is that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and I'll be left with a price I'm not satisfied with.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value of $1,000,000, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
