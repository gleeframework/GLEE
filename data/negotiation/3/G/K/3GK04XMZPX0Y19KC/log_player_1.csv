Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price in the range of $12000 to $13000. This would be more in line with my budget and would allow me to get the most value out of this investment. Would you be willing to consider this price range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 13000}"
