Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the value this product brings to your business. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 just doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. To make a deal work, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your needs while still ensuring I get a fair price. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

While Alice is getting closer to a price you might accept, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000, especially with several rounds left. You can get the product for $800,000 from John with no further negotiation hassle."
