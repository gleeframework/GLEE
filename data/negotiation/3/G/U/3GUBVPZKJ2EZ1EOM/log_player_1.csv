Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,325,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds my minimum price and avoids the risk of negotiations failing."
