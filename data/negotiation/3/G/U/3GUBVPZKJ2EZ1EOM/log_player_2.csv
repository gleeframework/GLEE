"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $1,350,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for further negotiation:** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **John's offer remains a viable alternative:** It's good to have this option in case you can't reach a better agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close the deal. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
