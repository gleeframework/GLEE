"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your target price.  While it's tempting to accept, you have room to negotiate and potentially save a significant amount. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 represents a fair valuation considering the potential returns, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,225,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,000,000. While it's closer, you still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and try to reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a significant step toward a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing progress here.  To be frank, I have another interested buyer, but I believe this deal would be very beneficial for you. I'd be willing to come down to $1,190,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your target price and she's clearly indicating this is her final offer.  While you could reject and try to get it lower, the risk is that she'll either walk away or you'll have to go with John at $1,500,000.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and securing the product for a decent price."
