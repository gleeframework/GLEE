,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 represents a fair valuation considering the potential returns, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,225,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a significant step toward a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing progress here.  To be frank, I have another interested buyer, but I believe this deal would be very beneficial for you. I'd be willing to come down to $1,190,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
