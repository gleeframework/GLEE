"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",135.0,Bob,4,
