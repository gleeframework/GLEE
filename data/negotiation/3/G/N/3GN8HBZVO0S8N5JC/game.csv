"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its quality and features. Would you like to buy it from me for $180?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to go up to $100 at this time.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. It's a fair price considering the quality and value it offers.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $100. It's the most I can afford at this time, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",130.0,Alice,5,
