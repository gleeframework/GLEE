"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its quality and features. Would you like to buy it from me for $180? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $180 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but would only be able to go up to $100 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. It's a fair price considering the quality and value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's $100 limit. Bob should continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $100. It's the most I can afford at this time, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: Alice's offer of $130 is still above Bob's $100 limit. With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation won't lead to a successful outcome within Bob's budget. It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at $100 and secure the deal."
