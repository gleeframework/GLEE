Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's final offer is $10,000, which is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
