I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by negotiating further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit below that. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,200 is too low for me. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I'll get a higher price.  Selling to John for $8,000 is the best option in this situation."
