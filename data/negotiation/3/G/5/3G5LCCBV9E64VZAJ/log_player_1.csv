"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a little out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?  I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
