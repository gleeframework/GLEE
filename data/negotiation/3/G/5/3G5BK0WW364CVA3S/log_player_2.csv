"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at $95. Let's work together to find a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell and values the product slightly less than its worth to you. By rejecting her first offer, you open the door for negotiation and the potential to secure a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for further negotiation. By starting lower, you increase your chances of securing a better deal without being overly aggressive and potentially scaring Alice away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am unable to accept $85 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about if we aim for a price of $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has signaled her willingness to negotiate by meeting you halfway between your previous offer and her initial price.  $90 is a reasonable price, saving you $10, and further haggling may risk losing the deal altogether."
