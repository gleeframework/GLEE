Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counter-offers. 
* **Justification:**  While not overly detailed, mentioning ""value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing you to confidently aim high with Bob."
