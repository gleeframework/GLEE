"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $750,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $825,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable compromise.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I still believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I propose $775,000. I hope this suggestion will be acceptable and move us closer towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to meet halfway.  However, $775,000 still falls short of my expectations.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to lower my price to $800,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This offer reflects the product's true value and allows for a successful transaction.  I believe this is a fair solution for both parties.",800000.0,Alice,5,
