"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can counteroffer at a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He knows Alice values the product at $10,000, so he's offering a price slightly above that, hoping to reach a compromise.  This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate but still leaves Bob with a significant saving compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and Bob might end up paying more at John's store. Accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
