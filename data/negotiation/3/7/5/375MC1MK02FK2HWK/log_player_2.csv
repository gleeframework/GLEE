{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Rejecting allows you to gain information.** By rejecting, you can see if Alice is willing to lower her price.

Round 2

* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to come down in price. If she rejects, you'll know you need to be more conservative in the following rounds.
* **Still room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects, you have plenty of rounds to negotiate further."
