Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $120 is a fair offer, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. How about we settle at $125?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $115? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a price I'm happy with.  I'm willing to push a bit further since I have plenty of rounds left and a $100 backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I understand you're on a budget.  Let's make this easy - $120 and it's yours.  I'm confident you won't find a better deal on this."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm meeting Bob at his previous offer price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, and it's unlikely he'll go much lower. It's a strong position to potentially close the deal."
