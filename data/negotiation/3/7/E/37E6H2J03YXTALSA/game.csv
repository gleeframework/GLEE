"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has a lot of value, and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While the product is good, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it offers.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I see where you're coming from, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $15,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $14,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. While $14,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,500. Would you be open to that figure? ",12500.0,Bob,6,
