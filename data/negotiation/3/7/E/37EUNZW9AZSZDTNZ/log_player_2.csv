"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($150). You should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $100, which is still a good deal for her since it's more than the product's worth to her ($80). This price also falls within my budget of $150, and gives Alice some room to negotiate if she wants to keep the deal going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a better deal than buying from John for $150. It's still more than the product's worth to me, but it's a reasonable price considering the back and forth.  It's likely that further negotiation would only lead to a small reduction in price, which wouldn't be worth the time and effort."
