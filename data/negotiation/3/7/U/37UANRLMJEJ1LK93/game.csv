"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet the price of $16500. I would like to propose $15000 as a compromise, which is closer to my budget while still reflecting the value I see in the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
