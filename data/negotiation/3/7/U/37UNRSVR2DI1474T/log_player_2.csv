"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $11,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $11,000 is significantly less than the $15,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While $11,000 is a decent price, there's still potential to negotiate lower. However, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice getting more stubborn increases with each round.

At this point, it's a good balance of getting a good price and minimizing risk."
