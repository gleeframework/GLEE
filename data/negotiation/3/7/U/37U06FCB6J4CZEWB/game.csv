"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the minimum I'm willing to accept. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1350000 is closer, I'm still at my limit of $1300000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1300000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1320000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
