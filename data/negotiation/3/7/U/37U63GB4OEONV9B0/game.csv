"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this offer reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is quite high though. This product would be valuable to me, but at a more reasonable price point. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents value, but so does a mutually beneficial deal.  I can go up to $1,200,000, but that's my limit for now.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price. To be transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000, but I'd prefer to close this deal with you. My final offer is $1,650,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement and your transparency. However, that final offer is still a significant jump from where we are.  If you're willing to come down to $1,350,000, we have a deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
