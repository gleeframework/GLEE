Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential for both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, it's clear that further negotiation with him is unlikely to yield a price that surpasses John's offer of $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer guarantees me the best possible outcome at this point."
