"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is still below my minimum value of $120. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This still gives you a good price, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, showing flexibility.
* **Maintaining Value:** $90 is still above my minimum value of $120, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the benefit of the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and there's a possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations, especially as I have the option of selling to John for $120."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Maintaining value:** $87.50 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Reiterating the value:** I am emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob by highlighting the product's quality and the fair price.
* **Building urgency:**  By implying I'm willing to compromise, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $82.5 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is still showing a willingness to negotiate, and there's potential for a higher offer.
* **Selling to John is an option:** I have the option of selling to John for $120, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still a few rounds left, and I can try to get a higher price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you continuing the discussion.  While I understand your budget constraints, $82.50 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm again offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Maintaining value:** $85 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $120, but closer to Bob's offer, making it seem more appealing.
* **Reiterating the value:** I am emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob by highlighting the product's quality and the fair price.
* **Creating urgency:** By implying I'm willing to compromise, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a final offer of $80, which is the price I was thinking of all along. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $80 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120, and even if I reject his offer, he might be serious about going to John.
* **Limited negotiation rounds remaining:** There are only two rounds left, and it's unlikely I can get Bob to go higher.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could result in a lower price or even no deal at all.

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or potentially losing the deal altogether."
