"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This still gives you a good price, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. ",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you continuing the discussion.  While I understand your budget constraints, $82.50 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a final offer of $80, which is the price I was thinking of all along. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,8,
