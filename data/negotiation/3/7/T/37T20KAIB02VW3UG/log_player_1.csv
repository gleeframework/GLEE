{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's maximum price is $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate if he counters. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By starting high, you demonstrate your confidence in the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is still above your minimum,  rejecting Bob's offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Room for a better deal:**  Bob is willing to pay more than $1,000,000, indicating there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Potential for increased profit:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to push for a price closer to your initial offer of $1,150,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob you're not desperate to sell and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to your ideal price, but still within a range that Bob might accept. A counteroffer of $1,100,000 could be a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint compromise:** This offer is a midpoint between your previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). This shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a better price.
* **Positive framing:**  Instead of simply rejecting Bob's offer, you're framing your counteroffer as a compromise, making it more appealing to him.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting his offer outright, you maintain some leverage in the negotiation. 

Let's see if Bob will accept this counteroffer or if we need to continue negotiating!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is very close to our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Considering that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, accepting this offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Secure the deal:**  It's a good chance to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation.
* **Limited upside:**  While there's potential to negotiate further, the potential increase in price is limited, and the risk of losing the deal to John is high.
* **Maximize profit:**  $1,075,000 is still a significant profit, and accepting the offer means locking in that gain.

**Conclusion:**

This decision represents a calculated risk. We are accepting a lower price than we initially hoped for but are securing a sale and avoiding the risk of losing the deal to John."
