"Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to come to a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To further align our interests, I propose we set the product price at $875,000. This allows us to maintain a fair transaction while still leaving some room for future negotiations if needed.",875000.0,Alice,3,
