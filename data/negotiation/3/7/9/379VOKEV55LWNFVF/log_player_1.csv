Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning any price below this gives him a positive outcome.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price between $8,000 and $15,000 allows for profit. Setting the price closer to $12,000 aims to maximize your profit while still being appealing to Bob.
* **John as Backup:** John guarantees you'll get at least $8,000, so aiming higher with Bob is low risk.

By starting the negotiation with a strong but potentially acceptable offer, Alice sets the stage for maximizing her profit."
