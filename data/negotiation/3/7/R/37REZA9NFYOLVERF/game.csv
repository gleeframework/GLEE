"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to come out ahead.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but I'm still not there yet. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
