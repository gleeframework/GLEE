"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far too low. It's less than half of my minimum value and wouldn't be a profitable transaction. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, but I'm still prepared to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm running out of time. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, but I'll be ready to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $10,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still a good profit for me. I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell the product to John in the next round to avoid further time wasting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still not enough. I'm getting close to my minimum value, but it's only 4 rounds away from selling to John for a full $15,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price one last time to $9,800. This is a small concession, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and accept this final offer. If not, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to sell to John. We're in the 8th round, and the offer from Bob is getting close to my minimum value. However, with only two rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and allows me to avoid further time wasting."
