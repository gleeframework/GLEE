,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which would be $100. It's the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
