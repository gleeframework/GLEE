"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it at that price, it's a good deal. There's no benefit to rejecting the offer and buying from John at the same price."
