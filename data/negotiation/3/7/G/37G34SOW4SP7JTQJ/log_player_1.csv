Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives us room to negotiate without risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to maximize my profit. This price is a good middle ground and might be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not high enough. Since I'm confident I can get my minimum with John, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I get the best possible price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
