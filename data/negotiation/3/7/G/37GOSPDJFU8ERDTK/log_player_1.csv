Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and desirability, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still secure a good deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value and desirability,"" you subtly anchor Bob's perception of the price to a higher point.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint (""limited-time offer"") can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially leading to a quicker sale. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, you have room to negotiate down towards your minimum of $12,000. You have the security of John's offer, but always aim high initially!"
