Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. We want to capture as much of that value as possible while ensuring Bob sees the deal as beneficial. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still keeps us well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a level of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly rather than risk losing the deal.

**Important Note:**  While John represents a guaranteed $1,000,000, our goal is to maximize profit. It's strategically smarter to aim for the higher potential payoff with Bob."
