Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and direct, stating the price and emphasizing the value for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** $1,000,000 is closer to my ideal price than John's offer.
* **Encourage Bob to negotiate:** The discount makes the offer appealing while leaving room for counter-offers.
* **Maintain control:**  I'm not giving away too much initially, allowing me to adjust if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counter-offer and adjust my strategy accordingly, potentially moving closer to John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I have a backup offer from John for $1,200,000, giving me leverage in this negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to continue negotiating. This will hopefully encourage Bob to come up with a more attractive counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I will propose a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise closer to $1,000,000.
* **Monitor John:** I will keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer the product for $950,000.  This reflects the value it brings to you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but it's still a significant discount from my original offer and is within a reasonable range for both of us.
* **Message:**  I'm being polite and direct, acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value the product brings to him.  I'm also emphasizing a desire to find a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not giving in to Bob's first counteroffer, showing I'm willing to stand my ground.
* **Encourage Further Negotiation:** By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's, I'm hoping to incentivize him to come up in his next counteroffer.
* **Maximize Profit:**  $950,000 is closer to my goal than Bob's last offer, and it's still a significant gain for him. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any).
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob refuses to budge, I have the option to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $925,000. This allows us to reach a compromise that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $925,000 is very close to my last offer of $950,000.  While I would ideally like to secure a price closer to $1,000,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,200,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that is significantly below my ideal.

**Strategy:**

Accepting this offer allows me to:

* **Secure a Sale:**  I'm guaranteed to sell the product and earn a significant profit.
* **Minimize Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even a lower final price if Bob becomes unwilling to budge. 
* **Maintain a Positive Relationship:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to compromise, which could be valuable for future interactions.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalize the Deal:**  I will proceed with the necessary paperwork and arrangements to finalize the sale. 
* **Evaluate Future Negotiations:**  I will analyze the negotiation process to learn from it and improve my negotiation skills for future deals."
