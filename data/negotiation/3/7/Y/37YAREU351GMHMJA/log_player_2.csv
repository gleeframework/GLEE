"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate or head over to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested but could you do it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining and allows Alice to feel like she's getting a deal in the end.
* **Significant Difference:** The initial offer of $180 is very high.  Offering $60 creates a significant gap, signaling that you're serious about a much lower price.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but it's also firm in stating that the price is too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I really need to make a profit on this one. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down significantly, $120 is still quite a bit above your $80 maximum. There's room for negotiation, and you have the safety net of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we try $80? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're getting closer to your walk-away point.  It's time to be more direct and state your maximum price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying you're ""ready to buy right now,"" you add a bit of pressure and imply you might go elsewhere if she doesn't accept.
* **Fairness:**  While emphasizing it's a fair price to you, it's still below Alice's valuation, giving her a chance to make some profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $80 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $140. How about we try $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking to a price point that's too high for you.  She's come down, but not nearly enough. You've already presented your maximum price, and it's time to cut your losses.  John offers a guaranteed price that fits your budget."
