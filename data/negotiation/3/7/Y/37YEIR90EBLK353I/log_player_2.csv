"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This means you have room to negotiate and save money.
* **It's early in the negotiation:**  You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the first offer doesn't hurt your position.
* **You have an alternative:** You can always buy from John for $15,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer. 

**Next Steps:**  You should make a counteroffer in the next round that is closer to your value of $15,000, but still lower than Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Approach:**  This offer splits the difference between your value ($15,000) and Alice's offer ($12,000).  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer if she wants to negotiate further.
* **Showing Willingness to Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product but also want to get a good deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While slightly lower than her initial offer, $12,500 is still above your preferred price point. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** You still have multiple rounds left, and you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Jhon is a fallback option:**  Remembering that you can always buy from Jhon for $15,000 gives you leverage to continue negotiating with Alice.

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your ideal $15,000.  You might want to consider a slight increase from your previous counteroffer to show that you are willing to negotiate."

* **Moving Towards the Middle:** By increasing your offer, you're moving closer to Alice's most recent offer of $12,500, suggesting that you're both coming closer to an agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This offer still leaves room for further negotiation. You haven't reached your maximum price point yet, giving you the flexibility to make further counteroffers if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Alice's response:** See if Alice accepts this offer or makes another counteroffer. 
* **Be prepared to counter again:** If Alice rejects, be ready to increase your offer slightly again, but remember to keep it within your budget and target a price that works for you.
