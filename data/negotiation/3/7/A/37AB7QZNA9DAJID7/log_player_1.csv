""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy it for $10,000 provides a safety net. There's no need to go below that price."
