"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is quite high, though. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working within a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down significantly to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understanding the value of this product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but that's still quite a gap from where I'm at.  I'm serious about finding a deal, but it needs to work for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?  This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, the price of $1,700,000 is still a significant stretch for my budget.  To be honest, anything much above $1,200,000 is going to be a tough sell for me. I'm ready to close the deal today if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward.  Let's make this happen today.  If you're willing to meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,400,000, especially since she called it her final offer. While the product might hold some extra value for you, paying an extra $400,000 above your guaranteed alternative is too risky. John offers a sure way to acquire the product within your budget."
