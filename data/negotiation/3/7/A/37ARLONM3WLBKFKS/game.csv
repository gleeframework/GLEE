"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is quite high, though. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working within a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down significantly to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understanding the value of this product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential. To move this forward, I could consider a price of $2,000,000. This reflects the unique benefits and opportunities this product offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but that's still quite a gap from where I'm at.  I'm serious about finding a deal, but it needs to work for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?  This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, the price of $1,700,000 is still a significant stretch for my budget.  To be honest, anything much above $1,200,000 is going to be a tough sell for me. I'm ready to close the deal today if we can find a number that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward.  Let's make this happen today.  If you're willing to meet me at $1,400,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
