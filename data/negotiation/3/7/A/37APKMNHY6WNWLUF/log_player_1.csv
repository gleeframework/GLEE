"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is a compromise from my previous offer and is still above Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob is now only $3 away from my desired price. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale for a price significantly higher than selling to John.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to counter."
