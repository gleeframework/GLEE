"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $100. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $100 is still a bit too high.  Would you consider $97? It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",97.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $97 is getting close, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll offer it to you for $102. It's my final concession, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",102.0,Alice,7,
