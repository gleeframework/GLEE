Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing it as a ""great deal"" to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for a hard sell, allowing space for Bob to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be ready to either counteroffer or move on to John, who offers my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and even below what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While selling to John is the most profitable option, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** I believe I can push Bob to a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,500? This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the $10,500 price as a compromise and a ""great deal"" for Bob. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Avoidance of immediate rejection:** The counteroffer is not too far from Bob's initial offer, increasing the chance that he'll consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you consider meeting me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is far below my minimum price of $15,000 and my last counteroffer of $10,500. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob has indicated that he's reached his limit, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is taking valuable time that I could be using to secure the higher price from John.
* **Guarantee:**  Selling to John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is my desired minimum and a significant amount higher than what Bob is offering. 

It's better to take the guaranteed profit from John than risk further negotiation with Bob that may not result in a more favorable outcome."
