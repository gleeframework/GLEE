"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I think we can do better than that. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm feeling like we're not making much progress.  I'm willing to offer $10,500, but that's as high as I can go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,500, so how about we try $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $10,500. If you can't agree to that, I'll unfortunately have to consider John's offer.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is still below my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,9,
