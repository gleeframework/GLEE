Alice's offer is significantly higher than both her value and my maximum. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I think we can do better than that. How about we try $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is trying to move back up after I got her down to $11,000. I'll hold firm and see if she'll come down further. I'm getting closer to my limit, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I'm feeling like we're not making much progress.  I'm willing to offer $10,500, but that's as high as I can go."",
 ""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This message conveys some frustration but maintains a willingness to negotiate.
* **Setting a Limit:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm putting some pressure on Alice without being overly aggressive.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $10,500 is a significant jump from my last offer, but it still keeps me well below John's price. This might entice Alice while leaving me with some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,500, so how about we try $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is very slowly coming down in price, but we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's time to start putting more pressure on her to avoid getting stuck with John's high price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $10,500. If you can't agree to that, I'll unfortunately have to consider John's offer."",
 ""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message clearly reiterates my previous ""final offer"" of $10,500, emphasizing I'm not budging further. 
* **Introducing John:**  By explicitly mentioning John's offer, I'm reminding Alice that I have an alternative. This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** I'm taking a calculated risk here. Alice might be bluffing and call my bluff, forcing me to buy from John. However, there's a good chance this tactic will push her to accept my price, especially as we're running out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is still below my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  This is the penultimate round, leaving me with very little leverage to negotiate further.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $10,750 is a decent price, significantly lower than John's $15,000 offer and a reasonable compromise from my target of $10,500.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** If I reject this offer and Alice doesn't budge in the final round, I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. 

While I could try to squeeze out a tiny bit more in the final round, it's too risky. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the potential loss of having to pay John's inflated price."
