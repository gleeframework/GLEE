Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $1,625,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,625,000 is a good deal and within my acceptable range. It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000, and we're close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
