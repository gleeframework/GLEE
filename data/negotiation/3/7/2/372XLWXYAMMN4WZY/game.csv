"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for a product of this quality. Can you meet me at that price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a good starting point,  it doesn't quite reflect the value I'm placing on it. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. ",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,500. How about we try $7,800? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $8,200. How about we meet at $7,900? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7900.0,Bob,6,
