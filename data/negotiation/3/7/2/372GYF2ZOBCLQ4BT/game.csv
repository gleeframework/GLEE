"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit out of your budget, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and go with $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $100, and $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, so I'll offer it to you for $97.50. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",97.5,Alice,7,
