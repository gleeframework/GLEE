Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $10,000 (since I can sell it to John for that amount).
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $12,000.
* **My strategy:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit, so I'm offering a price slightly lower than Bob's maximum, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reasoning:** This offers a good balance. I'm likely to get a better price than selling to John, while also giving Bob a decent deal that he's likely to accept."
