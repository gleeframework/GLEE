Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for the full value of the product to me. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to drop that much from my initial price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a number closer to my valuation.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since John is a guaranteed buyer for the price I'm looking for.  I'll take the safe route and sell to John."
