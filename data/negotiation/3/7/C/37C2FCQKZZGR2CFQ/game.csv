"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $13,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,750, so how about $13,375?",13375.0,Bob,4,
