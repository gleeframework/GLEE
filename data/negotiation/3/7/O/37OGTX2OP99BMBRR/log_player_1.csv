"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to drop that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $12500?  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and we're getting closer to a deal.  It's also in my best interest to avoid risking a further drop in price or having to sell to John for a lower amount."
