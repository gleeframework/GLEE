"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 as a compromise. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about $1,075,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,075,000 is simply not enough for me to sell this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000, which is a significant compromise. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,125,000. How about $1,100,000? I'm willing to pay that, but no more.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
