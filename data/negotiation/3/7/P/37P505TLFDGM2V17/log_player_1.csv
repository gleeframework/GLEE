Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it'll be worth the investment for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can capture some of the surplus. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $12,000 is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Considering John:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, and it's also less than my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob claims his offer is final, I can still try to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John is a better option:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better deal for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $10,000, which is significantly higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own value.
* **Remaining Firm:** I'm still above my minimum value of $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome. This helps maintain a good relationship with Bob in case we need to negotiate further."
