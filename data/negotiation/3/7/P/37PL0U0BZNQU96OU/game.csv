"Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the potential it holds for you, I am extending an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. To try and meet somewhere in the middle, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. This allows us to both benefit from the transaction while respecting each other's financial considerations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. To make this work, I need to get the price down to $875,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad to hear that you're still interested in the product. I've considered your latest offer and am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $890,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still hoping to reach $875,000.  I understand you're committed to $890,000, so how about we meet in the middle at $882,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",882500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your persistence. I'm willing to consider $885,000 as a compromise. This price reflects the value of the product and respects your budget. I hope this proposal leads to a successful conclusion of our negotiations.",885000.0,Alice,7,
