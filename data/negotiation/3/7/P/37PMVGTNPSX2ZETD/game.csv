"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be perfect for you. I'm thinking around $20,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking closer to $10,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a significant gap from what I need to make this work.  Could you do $14,500? I'm trying to be as fair as possible here.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is important to you, and I'm willing to meet closer to your price point.  How about $13,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,6,
