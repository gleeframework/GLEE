"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which I believe is a fair price given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
