You can do better than $1,200,000.  You should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.

You're still closer to your goal with John's price. Let's see if we can get Alice down a bit further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,100,000. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $1,110,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000.

At this point, it's a good idea to accept Alice's offer. You've brought the price down to $1,110,000, which is only $110,000 more than what John is selling for.  You're unlikely to get it lower without risking losing the deal and having to buy from John."
