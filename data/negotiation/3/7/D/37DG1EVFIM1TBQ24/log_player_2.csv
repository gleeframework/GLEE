"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than both your maximum price and Alice's value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm beginning with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($70 vs. $100). This leaves room for negotiation and probes Alice's lower limit. 
* **Polite and Open:** My message aims to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. I acknowledge Alice's offer and express continued interest, fostering a collaborative spirit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, $90 is still above your target price.  It's worth seeing if she'll go lower.
* **Early Rounds:** It's still relatively early in the negotiation process. Rejecting now doesn't put you in imminent danger of running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be honest, I have a budget in mind that's closer to $80. Would that price work for you?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** I'm now countering with Alice's known value for the product. This is a negotiation tactic to see if she's willing to sell at a point where she makes no profit.
* **Transparent and Firm:** By mentioning a budget, I'm signaling a level of firmness without being confrontational.  It suggests that $80 is a serious offer. 
* **Still Early:** With several rounds remaining, I have some flexibility to see if Alice will accept this offer or propose a counter-offer closer to my target."
