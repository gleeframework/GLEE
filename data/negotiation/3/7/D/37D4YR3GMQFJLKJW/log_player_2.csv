"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better deal than Alice's original value of $1,200,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You can do better by either counter-offering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  $850,000 is within my budget and hopefully attractive enough to Alice to keep her engaged in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above my budget.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, but I'm still pushing to get a better price. A counter-offer of $900,000 is a compromise,  closer to Alice's offer but still within my target range. This keeps the negotiation moving while trying to secure a favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is closer to my budget, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  At this point, the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult, and I'm unsure if I can get Alice to budge further. It's in my best interest to take the guaranteed deal with John and purchase the product for $800,000."
