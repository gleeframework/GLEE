"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
