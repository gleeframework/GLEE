# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,200,000, a price I feel is fair considering the product's potential. Let's discuss!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get the price even lower. I'll aim for a price that's 10% lower than Alice's last offer.
