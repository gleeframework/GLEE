"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.  Let's make this happen!",120.0,Alice,5,
