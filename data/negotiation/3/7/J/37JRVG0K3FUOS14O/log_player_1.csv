Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you're still making a profit and avoids selling for less than your minimum value.

It's important to be flexible and willing to negotiate to find a price that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me, though. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if we can find a compromise, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 80}
