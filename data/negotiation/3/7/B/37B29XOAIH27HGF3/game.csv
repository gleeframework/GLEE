"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $18,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to considering $13,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount. Could we agree on $16,000? This would be my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the concession. To be completely transparent, I have an alternative option to purchase a similar product for $10,000. To make this work, I'd be willing to go up to $14,000.  It's my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",14000.0,Bob,6,
