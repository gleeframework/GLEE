"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal you're offering. However, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $125. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go to $110, Alice, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $115.  It's a fair price that's within both of our ranges.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're getting closer to my price, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll offer you the product for $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my last offer of $115. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good value for the product. Let's close this deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your last offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll make one more counteroffer: $128. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $128 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $122?  It's a compromise that's fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",122.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal.",125.0,Alice,9,
