Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially accept a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Even though Bob has rejected my initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $145?  I'm flexible, and I really want to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable sale for me.
* **Emphasis on Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise to increase the chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid an impasse.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer.  
* If he accepts, the deal is done. 
* If he rejects, I'll need to evaluate his new counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if it's time to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $145 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not enough:** $135 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, the potential gain is minimal.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer. If I reject it, there's a high chance he'll stick to his word, and I might be forced to accept a lower price than I'd prefer.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is a safer and more profitable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John and end the negotiation with Bob."
