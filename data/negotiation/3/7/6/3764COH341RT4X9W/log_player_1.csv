"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```
Reasoning: 

Starting with a strong initial offer ($95) makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Anchoring:** It sets a high anchor price, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It gives me space to come down in price if Bob pushes back, making me appear flexible.
* **Maximizes potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I secure a near-optimal deal.

It's important to balance firmness with a willingness to negotiate, especially as I have the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I value the product at a higher price point.  Would you consider $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate by coming down $5, but also holds firm on a price above my minimum. 
* **Testing the waters:**  A $90 offer will reveal how much Bob truly values the product and how much he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $87, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I could try to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk:

* **Bob might walk away:**  He's shown willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee he'll go higher. 
* **Time is ticking:**  We're already on round 4, and further rounds increase the chance of the deal falling through.

Accepting $87 now secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
