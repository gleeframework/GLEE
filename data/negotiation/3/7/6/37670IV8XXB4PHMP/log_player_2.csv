"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000,  a $5,000 offer is a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it allows for more room to negotiate.  It's likely Alice will reject this, but it sets the stage for a more favorable price in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $4,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still have room to negotiate.  I'm going to try and get an even lower price by rejecting this offer and sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to get a good price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice than her previous offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to my ideal price, but I still believe we can reach a better agreement. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $4,500 is getting close to my limit. I'm making a counteroffer of $4,000, which is a significant move towards her position. This shows Alice my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a lower price. Hopefully, this will lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $4,750 is very close to my ideal price.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as it saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  There's a chance I could get a slightly lower price with further negotiation, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially pushing the price higher is not worth it at this point.  It's better to secure the deal at this price than to risk losing it and having to pay more."
