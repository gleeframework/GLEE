"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think it's worth noting that the product's value is still quite high, and I'm not willing to go below $700,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $700,000?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $700,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $675,000. Would that be feasible?",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to the price you're looking for, but I'm still not comfortable going below $690,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you a deal at $685,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",685000.0,Alice,5,
