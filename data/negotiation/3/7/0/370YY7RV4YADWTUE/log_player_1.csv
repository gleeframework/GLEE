Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to make sure Bob doesn't reject the offer. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it slightly above this gives him an incentive to buy, as he's getting a small ""deal.""
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. This allows Alice to start higher with Bob.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice is:

1. **Leaving room for negotiation:** If Bob counter-offers, there's space to settle closer to $12,000.
2. **Creating a sense of urgency:**  By mentioning listing it publicly, Bob might feel he needs to act quickly."
