Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, and I think that's a fair price for this product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This time, I'm going to sell to John. Bob is firm on his $12,000 offer and I've already lowered my price.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price."
