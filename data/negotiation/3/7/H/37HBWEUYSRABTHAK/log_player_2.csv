You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking of a price a bit closer to my original offer. How about $6,800? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is a better offer than her original price, it is still higher than what he is willing to pay. He can still negotiate with Alice, or if he doesn't want to negotiate further, he can purchase the product from John for $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're pushing your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $6,800. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get to an agreement.
