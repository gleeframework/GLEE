"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $6,500. I think this is a great deal considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $6,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking of a price a bit closer to my original offer. How about $6,800? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me.",6800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $6,800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really pushing my limit here, but I can offer $7,200.  Let's try to find some common ground.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to move on to other options.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're pushing your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $6,800. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get to an agreement.",7000.0,Alice,5,
