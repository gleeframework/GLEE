Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is equal to the product's value to me. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and there's always the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting his offer ensures I get the product's full value and avoids any potential for loss."
