Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach my $10,000 limit.  It's better to secure the product from John at my target price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
