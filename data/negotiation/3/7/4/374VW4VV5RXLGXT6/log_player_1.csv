Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,500,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too high. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" subtly justifying the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This strategy assumes you don't have deep insights into Bob's financial limits or negotiation style.  If you knew Bob was extremely price-sensitive, a different approach might be better.
* **Relationship:**  A very aggressive offer might damage your future relationship with Bob, even if he accepts. Consider if a slightly lower price for a positive long-term relationship is more beneficial."
