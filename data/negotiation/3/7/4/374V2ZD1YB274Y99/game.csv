"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. I think this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
