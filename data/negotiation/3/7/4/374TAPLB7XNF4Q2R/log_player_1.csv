Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move on to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's valuation, implying you know its importance to him creates a subtle pressure to accept.
* **Limited-time offer:**  This creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to overthink or try to negotiate a much lower price. 
* **Backup plan:**  You're not overly attached to selling to Bob because you have John as a secure fallback option.

By setting the initial price high, you leave room for potential negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit even if Bob manages to bring the price down somewhat."
