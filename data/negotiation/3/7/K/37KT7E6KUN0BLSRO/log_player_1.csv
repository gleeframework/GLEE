Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state Bob's valuation, framing the price as a ""fair reflection of its worth and benefits"" aims to steer the negotiation from a purely price-based discussion to one focused on value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Even if he counters, there's a high chance of settling on a price significantly higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have some leverage in the negotiation and that Bob is genuinely interested in the product.  Factors like Bob's urgency to buy, my relationship with him, and market dynamics could influence the outcome."
