Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing a slightly risky strategy to maximize profit:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own something truly unique.  I know its value to you is considerable.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We're aiming high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium to secure the product. The $1,150,000 is closer to his perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and calling it a ""one-time offer"" adds pressure without revealing your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While we start high, there's a small margin for Bob to negotiate down if he's hesitant, but still netting you a profit above John's offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves some risk. If Bob is a tough negotiator or highly price-sensitive, he might reject the offer. However, it offers the potential for the highest profit margin."
