Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This makes the offer attractive to Bob while still giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which may encourage him to accept. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, and I'm prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price. This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit,  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob for the potential to earn more.  

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105). It shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the fairness of the new price and the value Bob will get from the product, hoping to encourage acceptance. 
* **Strategic Move:** I'm hoping this offer will entice Bob to close the deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there. How about $108?  That's a good compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely or that I'll waste time in a drawn-out process.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting his offer ensures a profit of $108, which is still a good outcome. 

It's time to take the deal and move on."
