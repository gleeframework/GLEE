"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better deal than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8,000, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a compromise - I'll meet you in the middle at $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's target.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is the highest I can go at this point. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. "", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Can we meet at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $12,000, but it's still not ideal.  At this point, continuing to negotiate is risky. It's possible that Alice will become stubborn and refuse to budge further, leaving Bob with no option but to buy from John at $12,000. 

Therefore, the safest option is to buy from John.  Bob gets the product for his maximum price, guaranteeing the deal without risking a breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
