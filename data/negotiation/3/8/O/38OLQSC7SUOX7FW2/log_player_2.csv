"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.**  This gives you control over the negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is significantly lower.** This shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Offers a reasonable starting point.**  $8,500 is still above Alice's minimum price point ($8,000) but leaves room for compromise. 
* **Sets the stage for negotiation.** This counter-offer allows for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $8,500 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $9,000.  This gives us both a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $9,000 is less than your maximum of $10,000.
* **The price is reasonable.** It's a compromise from both sides,  and a fair middle ground.
* **Accepting saves time and effort.**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better price.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting the offer secures a good deal within your budget and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice before needing to buy from John."
