Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strategic pricing:** Offering the product at $2,250,000 (150% of its value to both of you) allows you to potentially gain a significant profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique benefits"" and ""potential worth"" aims to justify the high price and pique Bob's interest. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower the price, but you can't go higher once the initial offer is made. Your bottom line is $1,500,000."
