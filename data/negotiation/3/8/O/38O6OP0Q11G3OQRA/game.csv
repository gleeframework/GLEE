,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to offer you $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125. This still leaves me with a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still only able to go up to $110.  If that works for you, I'm ready to buy.",110.0,Bob,4,
