You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to buy the product for $80 or less, and Alice's initial offer is too high.  You'll try to negotiate a lower price with her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 right now. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $100. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer again. While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above your target price of $80. You'll try to negotiate a lower price again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a little too high for me. I'm really trying to stick to my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $90 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to get a sale."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $95. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $95. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $95 is still above your target price of $80, and you've already rejected several offers from Alice.  It's likely that you won't be able to negotiate a price lower than $95 with Alice, especially since she's already lowered her offer several times.  John is offering the product at your target price, so it's a better deal for you."
