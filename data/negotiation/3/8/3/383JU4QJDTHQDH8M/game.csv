"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to get a better deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is closer to where we need to be. However, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $10,750. This price represents a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. ",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm thinking of $10,200. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Bob,6,
