"Alice, that's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is already a competitive price for this product. I could meet you halfway at $12,750.  This is a fair deal considering the value it brings.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
