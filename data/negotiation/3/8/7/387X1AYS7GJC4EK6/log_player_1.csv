Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it at $1,000,000. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Bob ($75,000) while still securing a significant gain for you ( $125,000 over your minimum).
* **Confident but Fair Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as beneficial for both parties. This approach increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the deal."
