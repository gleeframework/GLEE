{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting while securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Time Constraint:**  Adding a time limit creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially prevent him from trying to negotiate a lower price."
