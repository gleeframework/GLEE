* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance that Bob could negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer, and he'd be left with no deal.
* **Secure a deal:** Buying from John guarantees that Bob gets the product for his maximum price.  While it's not the ideal scenario, it's a safer option given the limited time.

**Conclusion:** Given the limited time and the small difference in price, Bob decides to buy the product from John for $12,000 to ensure he gets the product."
