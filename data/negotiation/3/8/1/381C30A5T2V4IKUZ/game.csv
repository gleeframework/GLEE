"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but the product's value is considerably higher than that to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects a compromise we can both agree on. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
