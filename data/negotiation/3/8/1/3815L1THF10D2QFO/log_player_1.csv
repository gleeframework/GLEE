Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  Here's why:

* **Not too aggressive:** $120 is a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still being closer to your desired profit.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and positive.
* **Open ended:** The message invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still not close to my desired profit margin.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and am willing to pay $105 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, $105 is a decent profit and close to my minimum. It's better than selling to John and getting only $80.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on!"
