Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). However, it leaves room for negotiation and potentially discovering if Bob values some unstated aspect of the product higher.
* **Justification:**  The message uses phrases like ""fair deal"" and ""value and potential"" to subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind without revealing your absolute bottom line. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You have room to negotiate down towards his valuation, knowing your alternative buyer exists. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While you have John as a backup, a quicker sale to Bob might be preferable even at a slightly lower price. You could imply a mild time constraint if you want to encourage a faster decision."
