"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $13,500. This is a one-time opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than John's price of $15,000, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($12,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale."
