"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $95?  Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer of $90.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. How about $87? I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $87 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  How about we split the difference at $90?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced $90 is the best price. How about $88? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer of $87, but I need to stay within my budget.",88.0,Bob,8,
