I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum threshold of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I would like to make a bit more than $150, Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum threshold.  To ensure I get at least $150, I'll sell to John."
