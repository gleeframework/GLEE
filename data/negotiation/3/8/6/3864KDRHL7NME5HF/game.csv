"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,500 to close this deal. Let's make it happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500. How about $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,4,
