{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're aiming for a price closer to your $800,000 limit, and $950,000 is still too high.  You have room to negotiate and can see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering Alice $850,000. This is a significant drop from her initial offer and closer to my target price. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my target, I'm not ready to give up the leverage of my counteroffer. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $875,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still not willing to meet her price.  I hope this offer will encourage her to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but it's still too high. I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can negotiate further with Alice, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. To guarantee I get the product within my budget, I'm going to take the safer option and buy it from John."
