Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice has met my best possible price. There's no point in rejecting and trying to haggle further, or buying from John at the same price."
