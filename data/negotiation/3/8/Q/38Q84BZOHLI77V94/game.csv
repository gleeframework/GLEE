"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit high.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Can you consider that price?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $1,175,000? It's a fair price that considers both our positions.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart from $1,175,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value of this product to me. How about we try $1,250,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair deal. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,212,500? It seems like a reasonable compromise.",1212500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your creative approach, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to consider your compromise, but I think I can do better than $1,212,500. How about we try $1,280,000? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a little more. How about $1,240,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I'm hoping you can see it as a gesture of good faith to close this deal.",1240000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,240,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value of this product to me. How about we try $1,300,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
