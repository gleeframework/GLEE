"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice's initial offer is $100. 
* You can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $110, which is still more than you're comfortable paying. 
* You're willing to pay up to $120 but want to save as much as possible.
* Rejecting and counteroffering gives you the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, though, and I'm willing to go up to $95.  How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $105 is a fair price for this product. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $105, which is within your budget of $120 and is a good deal considering your initial counteroffer of $90. 
* While you might be able to negotiate a bit lower, the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a higher price (or Alice simply rejecting and you having to buy from John) is too high.  
* Accepting this offer secures the product at a price you're comfortable with."
