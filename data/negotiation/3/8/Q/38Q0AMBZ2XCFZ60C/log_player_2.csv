"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you would be very interested in. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and while I value it at significantly more, I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $900,000. This is a substantial discount from my true valuation, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. You can get a better deal from John."
