"I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $106? It's a good middle ground for us both.",106.0,Bob,4,
