"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a good value for you. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1000000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
