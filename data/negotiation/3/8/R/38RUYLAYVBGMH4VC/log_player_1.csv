{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $135 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob.  $135 is closer, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for this product.  How about $140? That's a good middle ground, and I'm willing to make that final concession."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. How about $137.50? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point.  Although I'd prefer a bit more, it's worth it to avoid the risk of going back and forth and potentially losing the sale entirely.  $137.50 is a good compromise and a solid profit for me."
