Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without explicitly revealing her minimum price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

**Important Note:** While John offers a safety net, Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. Aiming high with Bob initially is a strategic move to potentially achieve that."
