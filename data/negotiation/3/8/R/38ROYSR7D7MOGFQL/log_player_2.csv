# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product.

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you.  You're getting the product for less than you would from John, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  Accepting the offer is the best strategy here."
