,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to your price point but need to be mindful of my budget.  How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet at $10,250? This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum price, and it still leaves room for you to profit from this product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",10250.0,Alice,5,
