"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe its fair market value is around $20,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  Don't be swayed by her sales tactics. You'll get the best deal by going with John."
