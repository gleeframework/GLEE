"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, as it represents a significant saving compared to the market value. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a great deal! Alice is offering the product for significantly less than your $1,000,000 limit and even less than its apparent value to her.  There's no guarantee you could negotiate a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity."
