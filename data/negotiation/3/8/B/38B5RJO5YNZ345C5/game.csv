"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $175 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $142.50? That's a fair deal for both of us.",142.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the creative offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the split-the-difference approach. I'm willing to meet you at $145, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $140 is my final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John.",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $145. I think the product is worth it. I'll meet you at $142, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",142.0,Alice,9,
