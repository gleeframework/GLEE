"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. However, $950,000 is getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000 again, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can meet you at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Alice,5,
