Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me. What do you think?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to our budget, it's still above what John is offering. There's room for negotiation, and we haven't reached a point of desperation where buying from John at a higher price is necessary."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a firm budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that works for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but it's still not quite there. I understand you have a budget, but I also have a minimum price point. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,175,000.  This is a fair price that will allow you to get a good deal while still ensuring I receive a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is negotiating down, but slowly. We're getting closer to John's price, but it's still worthwhile to see if we can get Alice closer to $1,150,000 or lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm prepared to offer $1,140,000 for the product. This is a strong offer and reflects the upper limit of my budget. I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. We're both getting closer, so let's find that sweet spot. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal. It's below our maximum budget and a significant savings compared to John's price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not go lower, and we'd end up with a less favorable outcome."
