Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal on a valuable item. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice needs to offer a price that seems like a good deal to Bob while still being profitable. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that John will buy the product for $15,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. This allows her to price more confidently with Bob.

**The Strategy:**  

Offering the product just below $15,000 creates a sense of urgency and value. Bob might perceive it as a ""last chance"" to get a great deal, even if the price is still significantly higher than his valuation."
