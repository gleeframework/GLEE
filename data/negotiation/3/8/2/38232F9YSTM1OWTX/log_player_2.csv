"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $110, while John wants $120. 
* **You're willing to pay up to $120:**  You've stated that you value the product at $120, so $110 is within your budget.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer allows you to get the product for a lower price than John's."
