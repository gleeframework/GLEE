Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $85 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $90?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only comfortable with $85.  It's a fair price for both of us - it's a good deal for you because it's above your value for the product, and it's a great deal for me because it's below John's price.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob is making a reasonable argument.  $85 is still a profit for me, and it avoids the risk of continued negotiation or having to settle for John's offer of $80."
