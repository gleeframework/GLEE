Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $750,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. Selling to John would be a safe option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still believe that $750,000 is a fair price for the product. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $750,000. I've already made a significant concession from my initial asking price, and it seems unlikely he will increase his offer.  With only six rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal and losing out on a guaranteed $800,000 from John is too high.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
