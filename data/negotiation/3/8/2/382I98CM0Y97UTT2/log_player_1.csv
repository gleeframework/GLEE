"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high baseline for the negotiation and allows for room to come down if needed.  I believe this will give me the best chance of maximizing my profit, while still leaving room to negotiate if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that just yet. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price.  I believe I can get a better deal with some strategic negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still a considerable amount higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility on my part but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for his low price. It will be interesting to see how Bob reacts to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for $750,000 just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal if I continue negotiating with Bob. It's a risk, but I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. However, it's still above my minimum price and allows me some room for negotiation if needed. This should make Bob feel like we're getting closer to a deal, but it also keeps some pressure on him to come up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're approaching my minimum price, but Bob isn't showing a willingness to budge much further. It's getting risky to keep negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed offer from John.  I'll accept his $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
