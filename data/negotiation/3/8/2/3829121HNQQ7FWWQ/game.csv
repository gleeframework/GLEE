"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're open to that.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, due to my financial constraints, I can only commit to a maximum of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this revised counteroffer will be acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,115,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1115000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,105,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,110,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1110000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've also been considering the situation from your perspective. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,107,500 for the product. I hope this figure will be acceptable to you and bring us closer to closing the deal.",1107500.0,Bob,8,
