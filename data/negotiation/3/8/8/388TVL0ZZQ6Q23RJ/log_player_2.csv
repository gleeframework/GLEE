**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Alice's offer:** $1,000,000
* **Bob's maximum value:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000

If Bob rejects Alice's offer, he can still buy the product from John for his maximum value. This means Bob can potentially save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer."
