"I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting close to what I can spend, but $9,500 is still a bit too high. How about $7,500?  That's a significant increase on my last offer and would be a mutually beneficial deal.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $7,500 is still not enough. I'm starting to think we're getting close, though. I can offer it to you for $9,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",9000.0,Alice,7,
