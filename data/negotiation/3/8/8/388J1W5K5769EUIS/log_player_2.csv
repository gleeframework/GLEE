Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $7,500 is still not enough. I'm starting to think we're getting close, though. I can offer it to you for $9,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,000, and you have a guaranteed offer for $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a higher risk with very little potential reward at this point."
