"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. Let's start with an offer of $160. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $160 is higher than our budget and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

We start with a significantly lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. This offer is still a good deal for Alice if she's motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $140. This still allows us to make a reasonable profit while providing you with great value. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at John's price. Let's try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $140 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $125. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

We are inching closer to a price that works for us while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $135 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and $135 is a reasonable price, saving us $15 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
