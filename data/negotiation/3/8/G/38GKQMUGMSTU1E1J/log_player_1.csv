Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since that's our guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price that's enticing but still profitable for us.
* **Negotiation Room:** The message hints at the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, justifying the high price.  The slightly lower price than John's offer allows for some negotiation room if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know *for certain* that John will buy at $1,200,000. If that deal is absolutely guaranteed, Alice might as well start higher with Bob (closer to $1,199,999)."
