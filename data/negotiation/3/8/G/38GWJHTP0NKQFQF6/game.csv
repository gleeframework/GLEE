"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. Let's find a middle ground - how about we consider $1,700,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your initial interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but $1,700,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you consider $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand where you're coming from, but $1,250,000 is still a significant gap from what I believe is a fair reflection of its value. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal for a product of this caliber.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
