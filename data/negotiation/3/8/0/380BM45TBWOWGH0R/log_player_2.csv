# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice is offering it for $100, which is within your budget.
* While you could potentially get a slightly better deal from John, it's not worth the risk of losing the product altogether."
