"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get at least $1,500,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget.  It's worth rejecting and starting negotiations.  I'll try to get the price closer to my $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly over my budget. To be in the ballpark, I'd be willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point given my budget and the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to try to get it lower again.  It's better to keep negotiating for a better price than to settle at $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but it's still outside my budget. To close the deal, I'd need to stick to my original offer of $850,000. I'm confident this is a fair price given my budget constraints and the potential of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which will give you added value and peace of mind. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering additional value with the warranty and support package, the price of $950,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get her closer to my target. I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. The warranty and support package are attractive, but I'm still constrained by my budget.  To make this work, I'd need to stay at $850,000. I'm eager to work with you, and I'm confident that this price allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll throw in an additional 2 years of warranty, making it a total of 7 years, and I'll also include a 10% discount on the purchase price. This is my final compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. Let's see if this is a price you can live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hesitant. I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get her down even further. I've already established that I'm willing to pay $850,000, and with the added warranty and discount,  I believe I can get her to agree."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for the offer. The extra warranty and discount are definitely tempting, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm confident we can close this deal if you come down to $875,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $875,000, which is $887,500. I'll also throw in an additional 1-year maintenance package, which will give you even more value for your money. Let's see if this is a price you can accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is still above my budget and I only have one round left.  While I've been successful in driving down the price, it's getting risky to continue. I'm confident I can get a better deal with John, especially since his price is significantly lower.  It's time to cut my losses and go with a guaranteed lower price."
