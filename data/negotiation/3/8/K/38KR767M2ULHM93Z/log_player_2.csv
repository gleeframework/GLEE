"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is only $1 away from John's price, it's best to accept and save that $1. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price, and it might risk losing the deal altogether."
