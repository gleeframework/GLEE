"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 for the product, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. You can reject it and see if you can negotiate a better price with Alice or if John might offer a lower price."
