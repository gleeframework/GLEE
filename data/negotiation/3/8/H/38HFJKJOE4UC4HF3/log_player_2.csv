"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1000000 to you. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  He's willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so there's potential for both parties to find a price they're happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to Alice's lower limit.
* **Focus on Value:**  Bob mentions ""getting a better price,"" reminding Alice that he's aware of the product's value and is looking for a deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with ""Let me know if that's something we can work with,"" signaling Bob's willingness to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant improvement from her initial price of $950,000. This price is still within Bob's budget and represents a good deal for him, considering his willingness to pay up to $1,000,000.  While there's always the possibility of trying to negotiate further, accepting the offer ensures a purchase at a favorable price without risking the deal falling through or having to pay John's higher price."
