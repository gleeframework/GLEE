Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,000,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price of $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses language that implies value and encourages Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always sell to John at her minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves the risk that Bob might find the initial offer too high and reject it outright.  Negotiation skills and understanding Bob's personality would play a crucial role in a real-world scenario."
