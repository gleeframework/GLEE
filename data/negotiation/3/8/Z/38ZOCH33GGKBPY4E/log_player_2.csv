"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a significant asset to your operations.  Given its potential value to you, I'm asking for $1,400,000. This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to benefit from the product while ensuring I receive a suitable return on my investment.  I understand this is a substantial investment, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is within your budget of $1,500,000, but you can still get a better deal.
* **John is offering the same product for $1,500,000.** This is your upper limit, so you are not willing to pay more than this.
* **It is more beneficial to reject Alice's offer.** This will allow you to negotiate with Alice or explore other options, possibly leading to a lower price."
