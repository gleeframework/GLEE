Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $13,000. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, I can't go lower than $13,500.  This is still a significant discount for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my minimum price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
