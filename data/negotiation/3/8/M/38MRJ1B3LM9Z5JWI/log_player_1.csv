Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds fantastic, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. I'm hopeful we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
