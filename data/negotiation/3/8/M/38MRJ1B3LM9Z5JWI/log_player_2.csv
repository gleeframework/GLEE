Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds fantastic, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. I'm hopeful we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, it's quite a bit below my minimum price. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive from this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  I will counteroffer again, but I will be wary of reaching a point where it's more cost-effective to purchase from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.
