Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). While John offers a safe $1,000,000, we have room to negotiate and potentially secure a much better deal with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,080,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $80,000 over John's guaranteed offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
