Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:**  While the statement about the product's value is subjective, it aims to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.
 
This strategy balances ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we can try to negotiate a slightly higher price.  There's a chance Bob is willing to go a bit higher, and we haven't reached a point where continuing the negotiation is riskier than accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $125? "", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting a price directly in between the previous two offers is a common negotiation tactic and can be perceived as fair. 
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** This price point still allows for a reasonable profit above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $110 as the price for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still valuing the item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Profit:** Bob's offer of $110 provides a $10 profit, which is a reasonable return. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob, with little guarantee of a significantly better outcome. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations, allowing us to move on to other opportunities."
