"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from owning it. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done, but I really need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
