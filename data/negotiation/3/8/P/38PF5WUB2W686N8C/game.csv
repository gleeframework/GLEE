"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I've placed on it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $900000 is a bit low considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $1050000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1050000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $975000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $975000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1025000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
