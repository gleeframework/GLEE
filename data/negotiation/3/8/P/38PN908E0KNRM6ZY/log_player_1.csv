``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but also shows that you're willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to pay closer to $1000000. This is still a good deal for you, as you'd be making a profit, and it's my maximum budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to hold out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1075000? This would give you a significant profit and would be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
