(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're only a couple of dollars away from our initial counteroffer.

It's a good compromise that saves you money without risking losing the product to another seller."
