,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $110. This is a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable amount.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
