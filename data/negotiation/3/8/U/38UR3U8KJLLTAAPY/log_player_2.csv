"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good starting point, he can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $75,000 more than what Bob could get from John. It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly lower price, and it's more beneficial to secure the product at a price that's close to his target."
