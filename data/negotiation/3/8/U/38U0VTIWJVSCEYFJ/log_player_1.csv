Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This means we have a strong negotiating position and can afford to be ambitious.
* **Anchoring:**  Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to our desired outcome than if we started lower.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept before he loses the opportunity.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims high. It's possible Bob will reject the initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. We can always come down in price, especially since we have John as a backup buyer."
