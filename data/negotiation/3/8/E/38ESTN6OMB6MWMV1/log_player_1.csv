Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid losing the sale to John. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's attractive but still profitable for her.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $14,000, starting a bit higher leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a better deal. 

By offering the product at $14,000, Alice increases her chances of:

1. **Bob Accepting:** The price is significantly less than John's offer and provides a good value proposition for Bob.
2. **Negotiation:** If Bob tries to negotiate, Alice has room to come down slightly and still make a profit above her minimum."
