"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and encouraging message can help set a good tone for the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him can make my offer more appealing. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving space for negotiation and a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. How about we discuss a price closer to $1,400,000? I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, considering that Bob is showing interest in negotiating and acknowledges the product's value. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to bridge the gap and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and immediately counter with my own.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise and emphasize that it reflects the true value of the product. 
* **Meet in the Middle:** Offering a price closer to the middle ground can signal that I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price that meets my minimum requirement. 

I'm trying to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that we're not quite there yet, Alice. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd like to propose a price closer to $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with the true value of the product for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially negotiate further,  I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us. It's important to note that selling to John would net me the same amount, but negotiating with Bob allows me to potentially build a relationship for future business opportunities."
