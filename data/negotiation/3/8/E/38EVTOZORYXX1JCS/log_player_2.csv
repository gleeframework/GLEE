"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price or buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $12,000 maximum. By being polite and expressing interest, we aim to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but her offer is still above John's price. We haven't reached our maximum budget yet, but we're close. It's worth seeing if we can push Alice a little further down or get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $12,500 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you meet me in the middle at $11,250?"", 
""product_price"": 11250
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a deal. By suggesting the middle ground between her last offer ($12,500) and our previous counteroffer ($10,000), we demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly below our maximum. This keeps the negotiation moving and maintains a collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,875? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly very good at negotiating, and we're unlikely to get her much lower. While her offer of $11,875 is tempting, it's still more expensive than John's $12,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice increasing her price or us running out of rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
