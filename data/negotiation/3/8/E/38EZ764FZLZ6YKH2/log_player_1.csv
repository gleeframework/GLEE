Bob's offer:

While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us,  $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,112,500?

Bob's offer:

Bob seems firmly anchored at $1,075,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely to yield a significant increase. Accepting his offer means losing out on a substantial amount compared to John's offer. It's time to move on to the guaranteed deal with John."
