"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident we can agree on a price that's fair for both of us. How about we start the conversation at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can get the product for less from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
