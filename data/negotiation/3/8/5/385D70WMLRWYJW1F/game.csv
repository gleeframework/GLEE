"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
