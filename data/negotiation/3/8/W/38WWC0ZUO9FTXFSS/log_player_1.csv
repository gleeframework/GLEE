Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $15,000 right away might seem too aggressive and could make Bob less likely to negotiate.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower (closer to John's offer) leaves money on the table. This strategy aims to secure the sale with Bob at a favorable price."
