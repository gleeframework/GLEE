"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential returns.  To find a middle ground, I propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you significant value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However,  $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,250,000? I feel this is a fair offer, considering it's closer to the middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I understand this is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise. I could do $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer and would allow us to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
