"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Appear Confident:**  A strong opening offer conveys the product's value and your belief in it.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price signals your willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in multi-round bargaining.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would leave a significant amount of money on the table. 

While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. Rejecting this low offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the possibility of a higher sale price with Bob alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential returns.  To find a middle ground, I propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you significant value."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Reduction:** Moving down $300,000 from the initial offer shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong stance on the product's value.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""potential returns,"" the message emphasizes the product's benefits to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer attempts to steer the negotiation towards a price point closer to your minimum acceptable price while still offering a potential compromise for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However,  $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $1,250,000? I feel this is a fair offer, considering it's closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000), which suggests there might be limited room for him to go much higher. However, accepting his offer would still mean a loss compared to selling to John.  

Since we're not extremely far apart in terms of price, it's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap without losing too much value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's current offer and your desired price, demonstrating a strong commitment to finding a compromise while setting a clear boundary.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to seriously consider the deal without further negotiation rounds. 
* **Still Above the Alternative:** The offer remains higher than selling to John, ensuring that a deal with Bob would still be the more profitable option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I understand this is your final offer, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise. I could do $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** While not ideal, $1,300,000 is still a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price and a reasonable compromise.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob or lead to a stalemate, potentially causing you to lose out on a deal altogether.  
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows you to move on to other opportunities. 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and you've secured a price that meets your primary goal of making a substantial profit. Accepting this offer represents a pragmatic and favorable outcome."
