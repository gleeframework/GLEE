"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident you'll find it useful. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite a bit higher for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firmly rooted at $85 and unwilling to budge. It's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly higher than that. Accepting his offer would be a $15 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
