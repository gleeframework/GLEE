,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $115 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122?",122.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $122 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $118?  That's a small step closer to my target and I think we can both be happy with that price.",118.0,Bob,4,
