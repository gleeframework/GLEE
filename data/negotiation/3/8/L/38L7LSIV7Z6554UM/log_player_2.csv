"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring if Alice will go lower, so rejecting her offer and counter-offering makes sense in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer.  $1,050,000 is a good starting point as it's well below his maximum budget and represents a substantial discount from Alice's offer. This will allow Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and hopefully bring the price down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above what he wants to pay. Bob should continue to push for a lower price as he can still potentially get a better deal. There is a good chance that Alice might be willing to move further, especially given Bob's initial strong counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward, demonstrating Bob's commitment to securing the product at a reasonable price.  It's a significant drop from Alice's last offer, indicating Bob's willingness to be firm, while still leaving room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has come down to $1,050,000, Bob is still aiming to get the product for a lower price.  He's only $50,000 away from his desired price and has shown willingness to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price further, especially as she's already made concessions.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his ideal price and is now just $10,000 away. This counteroffer pushes for a final, small concession from Alice. It's a risky move as it could potentially lead to a stalemate, but the potential reward of securing the product for $1,010,000 is worth the gamble."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision. While Bob could potentially get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of a stalemate or Alice walking away is high.  Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and Bob is only $30,000 away from his ideal price. Given the limited rounds remaining, it's a reasonable strategy to accept this offer and secure the product.  It's a good deal, and the potential gains from further negotiation might not be worth the risk."
