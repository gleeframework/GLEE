"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident this product has significant value, but I can only offer $1,250,000.  This represents a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
