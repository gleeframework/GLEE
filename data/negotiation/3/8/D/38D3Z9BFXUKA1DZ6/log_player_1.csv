{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm pricing it slightly above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum price, hoping to encourage him to negotiate.  I'll be ready to counter any offers he makes and am prepared to walk away if he doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell it for anything under $11,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to drop below $11,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,750 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10250}
