"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable and worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $15,000. I need to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but need a lower price.  I'm hoping to strike a deal close to my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to propose a price of $16,000 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000.  While it's closer to what I'm willing to pay, I can still try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $16,000 is still slightly higher than I can manage right now. I'm confident that $14,000 is a fair price for both of us. It's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a good profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm aiming for a compromise that's within my budget but still shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to squeeze every last penny out of the deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $17,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still $2,000 above what I'm willing to pay. I have already shown Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and have made counteroffers.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, and I can potentially reach a price that's closer to my limit.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, and I can still try to convince Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $17,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  I'm confident that $15,500 is a fair price for both of us.  This price allows me to buy the product without going over my budget and still lets you make a good profit.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push to reach a price that's within my budget while still offering a fair price to Alice.  I'm increasing my offer from the previous round and emphasizing that I'm ready to close the deal at this price.  I hope that this will convince Alice to accept my offer and avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,250 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000. While we're getting closer, I'm concerned that we'll run out of rounds before reaching a price I'm comfortable with.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, it's more efficient and less risky to buy from him.  I've shown Alice that I'm a serious buyer, but I don't want to risk overspending or having to walk away from the deal."
