"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you considering my previous offer. While the product is nice, $18,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we possibly settle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm willing to come up a little. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
