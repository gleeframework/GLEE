"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```
Reason:Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and continuing the negotiation risks losing him as a buyer. Accepting the $10,500 is a good deal."
