Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal as he values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his offer and closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping to reach a deal that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob hasn't budged from his previous offer, and while I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running the risk of losing the sale altogether. Accepting his offer ensures I get a sale, and $9,500 is still a decent profit."
