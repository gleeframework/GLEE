Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than to my other potential buyers.  I'm offering it to you first at the price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000. My goal is to get as close to that upper limit as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000 (his value - my price). This is a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **First Refusal Advantage:** By offering it to Bob first at this attractive price, I increase the likelihood of a quick sale at a significantly higher profit than my fallback option with John."
