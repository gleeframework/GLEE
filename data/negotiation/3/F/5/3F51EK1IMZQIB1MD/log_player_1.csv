Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer. It's time to apply a bit more pressure."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I have to be honest, $1,250,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, and that's my final offer.  I believe this is more than fair considering the value this product brings. I do have other interested parties, but I believe you would be a perfect fit for this."",

It's time to accept.  We are getting very close to diminishing returns, and Bob is unlikely to move much further. $1,280,000 is a strong return."
