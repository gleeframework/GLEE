Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $10,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay slightly more if he sees the product as unique or urgently needed.
* **Negotiation:** This offer anticipates a counter-offer from Bob.  I'm prepared to negotiate down to a certain point, knowing I have John as a backup."
