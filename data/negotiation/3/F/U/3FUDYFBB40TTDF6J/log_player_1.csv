Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a reasonable price considering your minimum value and it allows for some negotiation space. You can adjust the price and message based on how Bob responds and what you learn about his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $80 is your minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
