"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no information about the product's value to Alice.  It's possible to get a better deal by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to do $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
