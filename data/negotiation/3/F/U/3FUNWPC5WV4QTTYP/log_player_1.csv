Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $15,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $14,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to meet the minimum price. Accepting his offer would be a loss, and continuing negotiations risks getting a worse deal or running out of rounds. John offers a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price."
