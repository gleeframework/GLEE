"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that's still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $700,000, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  I'm still well above my minimum value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still well within my desired profit margin.  This counteroffer should hopefully bridge the gap and keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $800,000, and I am confident I can achieve a better price. While John is a safe option at $800,000, I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm making a final concession to try to close the deal with Bob. This price is still within my desired profit margin, and it's closer to his previous offer, hopefully making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting risky.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I've already made a lot of concessions.  I'm worried I'll get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers, and time is running out.  It's best to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John now.  I'm still well ahead of my minimum value, and I can't afford to risk getting stuck in a deadlock."
