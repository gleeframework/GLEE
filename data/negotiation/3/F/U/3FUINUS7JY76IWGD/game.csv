"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $1800000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to $2000000 to make this work. How about $1900000? This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you to own a valuable product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but we need to be closer. How about $1800000? This is a fair compromise, and it's the final offer I can make. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
