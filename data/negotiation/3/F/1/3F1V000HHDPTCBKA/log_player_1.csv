Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but she needs to offer Bob a price that's enticing enough to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has the security of knowing John will buy the product for her minimum acceptable price, so she's not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
