,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can see the value in this product is worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $10500. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit.

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away from this deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If I don't get a yes from you, I'll be buying the product from John for $10000. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,10,
