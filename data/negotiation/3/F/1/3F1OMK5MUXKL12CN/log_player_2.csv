(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
