"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is simply too low.  I'm offering you the product for $17,500. It's a fair price considering the value I know this product holds.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $17500 is a good price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to see a more significant discount. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John at any time for $15,000, which is my absolute bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,000 is just too low for me.  I'm offering you the product for $16,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's compromise and finalize the deal at this price.  This is my final counteroffer, and if it's not accepted, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to see a price that's more in line with my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, but his offers are getting increasingly lower and are below my minimum acceptable price.  I don't see a clear path to a deal that meets my needs. It's time to cut my losses and move on.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price of $15,000."
