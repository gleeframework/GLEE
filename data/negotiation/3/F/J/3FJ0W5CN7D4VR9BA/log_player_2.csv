You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $125.** This is more than the product is worth to you ($150).
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $150, which is still within your budget. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
