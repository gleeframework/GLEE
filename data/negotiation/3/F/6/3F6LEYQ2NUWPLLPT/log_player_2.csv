"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower prices in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already given you a discount from my initial price of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $13,500 is closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $13,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $13,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is only $250 more than Bob's last offer.  At this point, the negotiation is getting close to the end.  If Bob rejects this offer, it is very likely Alice will counter with a higher price, potentially pushing the price closer to or even exceeding Bob's fallback price of $15,000.  

It is more advantageous for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that is still within his budget."
