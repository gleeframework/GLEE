"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  By rejecting the offer, you can start the negotiation process. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, especially if she's eager to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  I'm ready to close the deal if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $15,000 to $13,500, which is within your budget.  While you might want to try for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting her offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially advantageous option."
