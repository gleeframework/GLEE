"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's minimum value of $8,000. This counteroffer of $8,500 represents a significant saving for Bob while still leaving some room for Alice to potentially negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer of $9,200 is lower than John's price, Bob can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $8,750. This is still a significant saving compared to John's price and is closer to Alice's likely acceptable range. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a favorable price for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,400 is getting closer to John's price of $10,000.  At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate are minimal, and the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and ultimately leading to the purchase from John at the higher price is too high. Bob decides it's best to secure the product from John, even though it's slightly more expensive, to avoid the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation."
