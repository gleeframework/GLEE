Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,060,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we compromise at $1,070,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1070000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While we're getting closer, $1,065,000 is still too far below my desired price.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round, and if things don't improve, I'll seriously consider selling to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  With only two rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will come up to my desired price.  While I'd like to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, it's better to guarantee a sale with John than risk losing out on a deal entirely."
