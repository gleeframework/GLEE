Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'll see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a while, and $910,000 is a good price for me. It's closer to my target price, and it's a lot better than selling to John for $800,000."
