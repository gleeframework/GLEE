"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offered $1,100,000. This means she's willing to take a loss.  It's likely she'll be open to a lower offer. Rejecting her offer allows for a better price."

Alice has moved closer to my price, but it's still above my target. I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
