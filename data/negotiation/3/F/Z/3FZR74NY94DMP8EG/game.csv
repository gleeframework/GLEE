,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it still gives you a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10500? I think that's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
