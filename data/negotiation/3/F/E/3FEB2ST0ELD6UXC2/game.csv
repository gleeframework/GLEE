"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
