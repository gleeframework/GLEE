{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer.
* **The message** is friendly and open to negotiation, while also highlighting the product's value. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:**  Show Bob that I'm confident in the product's worth.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  Allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation.
* **Maintain a backup plan:**  If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John and secure my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept a quick sale, it's important to remember that I can still achieve a much better outcome by continuing the negotiation or selling to John. 

* **Negotiation:** I can try to push Bob closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale with John at my minimum acceptable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep my options open and avoid settling for a price that is too low."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That's a fair price considering its value to you and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000. How about $1,137,500?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your position, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference one more time and settle on $1,156,250?  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1156250}

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's persistence and reiterate my appreciation for his efforts. I frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" that allows both parties to find a middle ground. This approach emphasizes a collaborative solution and encourages a positive response.

**Strategy:**

By continuing to negotiate, I'm aiming to:

* **Test Bob's limits:** See if he's willing to go higher with his offer.
* **Maintain a strong position:** Ensure that I don't settle for a price that is too far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Prepare for a possible sale to John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a backup plan with John.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but no more. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher offer, but there's no guarantee. 

Considering the time and effort involved in continuing the negotiation, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John.  

* **Guaranteed outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of failing to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time efficiency:**  Selling to John allows me to finalize the deal quickly and move on to other opportunities.

Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
