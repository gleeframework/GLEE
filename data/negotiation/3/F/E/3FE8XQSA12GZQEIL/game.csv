"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  That's a fair price considering its value to you and allows us both to walk away happy.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000. How about $1,137,500?",1137500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your position, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference one more time and settle on $1,156,250?  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1156250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but no more. Can you meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
