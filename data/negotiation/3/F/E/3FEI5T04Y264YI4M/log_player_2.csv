The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product, $120. This is my absolute limit, and I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept."

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $130. This is still a good deal for Alice, as it's closer to her value than my original offer. However, if she rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John for $120."

Alice's offer of $155 is still too high for me.  It's getting closer to my limit, but I'm not willing to budge any further. I'll buy the product from John for $120."
