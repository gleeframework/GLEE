"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1500000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right buyer. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this, and I'm open to discussing a fair price.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1750000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, but I'm open to negotiation if you have any concerns.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
