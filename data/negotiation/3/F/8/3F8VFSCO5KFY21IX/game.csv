"Hi Alice, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm really keen on this product.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to explore other options.",125.0,Alice,5,
