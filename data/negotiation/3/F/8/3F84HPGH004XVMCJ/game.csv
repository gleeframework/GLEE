"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Alice,3,
