"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we try $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,000? That would be a great price for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
