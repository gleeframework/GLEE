"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
