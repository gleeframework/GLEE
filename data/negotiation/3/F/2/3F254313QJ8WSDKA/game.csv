"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,000,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable for both parties and respects the value of your product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
