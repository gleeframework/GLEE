"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product.  I could consider a price of $900,000.  This reflects the true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  $900,000 is still a touch high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
