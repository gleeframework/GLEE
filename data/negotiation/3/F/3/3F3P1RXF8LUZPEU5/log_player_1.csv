Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product.  I could consider a price of $900,000.  This reflects the true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  $900,000 is still a touch high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $750,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly above my minimum and provides a good profit margin.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me needing to settle for John's $800,000.
* **Relationship:**  A slightly quicker agreement might encourage future business with Bob."
