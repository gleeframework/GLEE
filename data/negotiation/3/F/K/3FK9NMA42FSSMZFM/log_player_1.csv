Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it allows for negotiation room and also signals the value I place on the product.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a significant price for this product if it's of great value to him, and this offer provides an opportunity to find that sweet spot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get more.  I'm going to see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,600,000 is a good deal and represents a significant gain over selling to John.  I'm confident that I've maximized my earnings in this negotiation."
