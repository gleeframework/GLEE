"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and give me an idea of his perceived value of the product.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation, knowing that I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds. 
* The 10-round limit and the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 provide safety nets, ensuring I don't lose out if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for the same price. 
* Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to attempt to negotiate a higher price. If I can't reach a better deal, I can always accept John's offer in a later round. 
* This strategy keeps my options open and maximizes my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a profit.
* The price is a reasonable compromise that could potentially be accepted by Bob. 
* This counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to make a higher counteroffer if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
*  I have 6 rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating for a potentially better price. 
*  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate to sell and willing to explore other options. This could pressure Bob into offering a higher price in the next round. 
*  If the negotiation doesn't yield a better price, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,200,000."

{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price again, but still above Bob's last offer and my minimum price. 
* This demonstrates a continued willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.
* I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that could lead to an agreement. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, it might signal that he's not willing to pay more, and I can start considering selling to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still slightly above it. 
* I have 4 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell at this point.
* I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a slightly better price. 
* Even if Bob doesn't offer more, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 in the next round. 
* This strategy gives me the opportunity to gain a slightly higher profit, but also allows me to fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm making a small counteroffer, increasing the price slightly from Bob's last offer but still below my initial counteroffers. 
* This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my desire for a price closer to my initial valuation.
* It's a strategic move to test Bob's limits and see if he's willing to budge further.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I can either sell to John for $1,200,000 or make a final counteroffer in the next round."
