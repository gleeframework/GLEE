"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $775000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $862500. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",862500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
