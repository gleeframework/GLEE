"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its intrinsic worth.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This reflects a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget limitations. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 is a substantial difference from what I believe it's worth.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,100,000? This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair balance between the value of the product and my budget. It's the absolute maximum I can offer at this time.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're at your limit.  This product is very close to my heart, and letting it go for less than its worth is difficult.  Would you be willing to finalize the deal at $1,090,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
