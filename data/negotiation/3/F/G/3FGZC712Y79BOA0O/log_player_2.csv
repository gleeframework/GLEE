"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $800000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price John is offering, but it's still a good deal since it's below your maximum budget. However, there's potential to save even more money. By rejecting the offer and counteroffering, you might be able to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's original offer, but still represents a substantial amount of money. By offering $700,000, we're showing Alice that we're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a fair deal. This initial counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still keeping the option of buying from John as a fallback."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $820000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a slight improvement from her original offer, but it's still higher than the price I'd be willing to pay right now. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can find a more agreeable price. I'm still confident I can get a better deal without exceeding my budget, and I'm willing to take the risk of pushing further in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  Given the product's value to you, I believe a price of $750,000 would be a fair deal for both of us.  This would allow me to stay within my budget and still give you a good price for your product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually increasing my offer while keeping it below my budget. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, showing that I'm taking her counterproposal seriously.  At $750,000, I'm still getting a better price than John, but there's room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to go down to $790000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $790,000 is a good compromise. It's still a decent savings compared to John's price and within my budget. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of Alice walking away, leaving me with only the option of John's more expensive deal.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with, minimizing risk."
