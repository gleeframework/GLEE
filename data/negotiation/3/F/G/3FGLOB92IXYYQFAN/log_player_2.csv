Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate lower.  There's still room to bargain, and he can always go with John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

* Alice's offer is now at his maximum price, and she's stated it's her absolute minimum. This indicates further negotiation is unlikely to result in a lower price.
* John offers the product for the same price, providing a reliable and certain alternative to continuing to negotiate with Alice. 
* There's a risk that Alice might change her mind and accept a counteroffer, but it's not worth risking another round to find out, especially with the time constraint."
