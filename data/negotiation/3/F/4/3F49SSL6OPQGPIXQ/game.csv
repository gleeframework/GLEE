"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which is still a significant discount from my original offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the opportunity it represents for your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - $1,025,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this deal. Remember, this product has immense potential for your business.  Let's finalize this before time runs out.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 as a final concession, considering the value and potential of this product for your business.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let's seal the deal before time runs out.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'm thinking $987,500. Can you consider that?",987500.0,Bob,8,
