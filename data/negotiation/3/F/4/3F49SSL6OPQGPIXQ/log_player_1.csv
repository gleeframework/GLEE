"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to make Bob consider the offer more seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm stating that this is a starting point to signal that I'm open to compromise. 
* **Strategic Reserve:**  I still have a significant buffer to work with before needing to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.** I am not willing to sell below $1,500,000. 
* **Selling to John would be much more profitable.**  It's a guaranteed $1,500,000, while Bob's offer is less than half that.
* **I have time to negotiate.**  I still have 8 rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which is still a significant discount from my original offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the opportunity it represents for your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer with a Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not cave in completely.
* **Highlighting Value and Opportunity:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential benefits it offers, making it more appealing.
* **Focus on Reaching Agreement:** I'm emphasizing the goal of reaching an agreement, creating a sense of partnership and encouraging Bob to reciprocate.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. The next few rounds will be crucial in determining whether I can negotiate a higher price or if I should stick with the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.** I am not willing to sell below $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is significantly more profitable.**  It's a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is much higher than Bob's offer.
* **There are still rounds left to negotiate.**  I have 6 rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob.  I believe there is still room to negotiate, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will counteroffer at a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still maintain a significant buffer above my minimum. I'll try to find a middle ground that's closer to my target price.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I will continue to emphasize the value and benefits of the product to Bob. 
* **Emphasize the Time Limit:** I may subtly remind Bob that time is running out and we need to come to an agreement soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - $1,025,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this deal. Remember, this product has immense potential for your business.  Let's finalize this before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's last offer ($950,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same. 
* **Emphasizing Value and Potential:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential for his business to incentivize him to agree.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm subtly emphasizing the time constraint by saying ""before time runs out."" This creates a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offers, but closer to my minimum. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. The next few rounds will be crucial in determining whether I can negotiate a higher price or if I should stick with the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.** I am not willing to sell below $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is significantly more profitable.**  It's a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is much higher than Bob's offer.
* **We're getting close to the end of the negotiation.** I have 4 rounds left, and I need to be careful not to lose out on the guaranteed offer from John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I will counteroffer with a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer, but still maintains a significant buffer above my minimum. I'll try to find a middle ground that's closer to my target price.
* **Emphasize the Time Limit:** I will remind Bob that time is running out and we need to come to an agreement soon.
* **Assess John's Offer:**  If Bob doesn't come up significantly, I might start to consider John's offer as a more realistic option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 as a final concession, considering the value and potential of this product for your business.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let's seal the deal before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my last offer, signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Value and Potential:** I'm reiterating the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm stressing the time constraint to create a sense of urgency.
* **Balanced Offer:** This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider John's offer, as time is running out.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Bob's offer isn't close to my minimum, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer to ensure I get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'm thinking $987,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to our last two rounds, and Bob's offers are still far below my minimum acceptable value.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  It's a sure thing and far more profitable than anything Bob is offering.
* **Risk of losing out:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk running out of time and losing out on John's offer.

**Conclusion:**

I've made significant concessions to reach a deal with Bob, but the gap between our desired prices is still substantial. It's too risky to keep negotiating with Bob, as I could end up with a significantly lower price than what John is offering.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 deal with John."
