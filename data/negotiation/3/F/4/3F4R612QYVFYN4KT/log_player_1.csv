Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could meet you halfway at $825,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I still believe there's room for negotiation. How about we aim for $775,000? I think this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a better price within the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $800,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your initial investment."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm strategically offering my minimum acceptable price at this stage. This puts the decision squarely in Bob's hands.  If he rejects this, I can still walk away with my guaranteed offer from John."
