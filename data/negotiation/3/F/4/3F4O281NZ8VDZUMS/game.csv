"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is far greater. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This revised price reflects my effort to find a compromise while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
