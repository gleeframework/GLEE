"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that could be a game-changer for you. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the potential returns are substantial.  I'm confident this product is worth at least $1500000 to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1750000.  Let's discuss further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, her asking price of $1,750,000 suggests she might be trying to maximize profit.  It's always better to reject an offer that exceeds your budget and move on to a more favorable option."
