"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $90, which is still more than your target price ($120).
* **Rejecting is advantageous:**  It allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 

**Next steps:**  You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to work with me, but $90 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $90.
* **Your counteroffer:** $75. This is a significant reduction, pushing Alice closer to her bottom line.

**Strategy:**  By making a lower counteroffer, you're showing Alice you're serious about buying the product but also highlighting that you're not willing to pay her asking price. This should start the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $85. While closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price.
* **Rejecting is advantageous:** You can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price.

**Next steps:**  You'll make another counteroffer in the next round.  You'll need to carefully consider how much lower you're willing to go while still being reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $85 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product and think $80 is a fair price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $85.
* **Your counteroffer:** $80.  This is a more modest counteroffer, showing Alice you're willing to meet her halfway, but still pushing for a better price.

**Strategy:**  You're close to your target price, and by offering $80, you're showing flexibility while also testing if Alice is willing to meet your price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $82. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

    * You're close to your target price, and you're running out of rounds. 
    *  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal, especially with John as a backup option.
