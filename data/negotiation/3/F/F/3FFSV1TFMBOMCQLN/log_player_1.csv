Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without explicitly revealing my hand.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating it's a ""starting point for discussions,"" I signal that I'm open to hearing Bob's perspective and potentially negotiating the price.

My strategy is to aim high initially and then potentially work my way down, using John's offer as a safety net if Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, as there's a good chance we can find a price point that works for both of us within the range of $1,400,000 and $1,500,000.  Selling to John is my backup plan if I can't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the market, however, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I could consider coming down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:**  I'm lowering my price by $250,000, which shows flexibility but also signals that I'm serious about getting a price that reflects the product's worth.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""unique"" value proposition again to justify the still-high price. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise somewhere between Bob's offer and my desired price.  I'm leaving room for further negotiation but making it clear that I'm not willing to go drastically lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,450,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,450,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit rather than risk a lower offer or a stalemate with Bob."
