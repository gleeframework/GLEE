"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the market, however, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I could consider coming down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,450,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
