"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  To make this an easy decision, I'm willing to open negotiations at $1,300,000.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $1,150,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,187,500? That's my final offer.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
