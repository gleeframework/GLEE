Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the framing of a ""special price"" might make him reconsider. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's perceived value. If you knew he valued it at $80, you'd likely offer it at a price slightly above that to try and make a small profit."
