"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  This product is worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop the price to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and your potential benefits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
