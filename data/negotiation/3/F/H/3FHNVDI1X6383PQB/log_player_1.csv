"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,250,000 is the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  It's better than John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for more."
