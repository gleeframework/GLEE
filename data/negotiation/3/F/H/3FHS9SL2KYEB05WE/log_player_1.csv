Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $12,000. I believe it's a bit higher than its actual value. Can you consider my offer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, I think there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
