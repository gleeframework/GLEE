"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm ready to offer $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  Let's try $12,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering both our needs and the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. I think this is the best compromise we can reach considering the product's value to me and your budget. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
