"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it offers tremendous value, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is within my budget, I want to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $130 is a fair reflection of the product's value, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. Could you do $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $120, which is still within my budget and a reasonable price.  I'm happy to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more or even losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
