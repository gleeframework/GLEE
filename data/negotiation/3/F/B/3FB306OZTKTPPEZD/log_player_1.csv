"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, but need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. It's worth trying to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,000? This is my final offer, and it aligns with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as John's offer, and I'm happy to accept it. There's no need to risk losing the deal by going through more rounds of negotiation."
