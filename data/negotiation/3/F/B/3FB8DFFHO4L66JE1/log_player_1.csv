Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also tests his willingness to pay. 
* **Creating a sense of value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving room for John:** While $19,000 is ambitious, it leaves a significant margin above your minimum ($15,000 from John) in case Bob negotiates down. 

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. You'll need to gauge his personality and negotiation style to adjust your approach effectively."
