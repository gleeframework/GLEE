"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While $130 is lower than your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Reason:This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to engage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice is coming down, but slowly.  There's still room for negotiation before reaching your $110 target or considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $115? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

Reason: This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($110) and Alice's counteroffer ($120). It shows willingness to compromise but also maintains pressure to reach a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $122. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while not ideal, $122 is a reasonable price, saving you $28 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome."
