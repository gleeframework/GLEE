"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much as I can.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your desire to save money. However, $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $105.  This would still allow you to get a good deal while ensuring I can make a fair profit. ",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $90. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle of that and $105?",97.5,Bob,4,
