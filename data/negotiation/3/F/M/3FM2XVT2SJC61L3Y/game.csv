"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $105 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $100.  It's worth that much to me, and I'm sure it's worth it to you too, considering how much you value it. Let's close this deal at $100 and both walk away happy.",100.0,Alice,5,
