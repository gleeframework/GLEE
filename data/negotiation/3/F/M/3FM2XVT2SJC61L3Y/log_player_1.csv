Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe it's a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $105 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about we meet at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92 is closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $100.  It's worth that much to me, and I'm sure it's worth it to you too, considering how much you value it. Let's close this deal at $100 and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we meet at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm selling the product to John for $100. Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're already halfway through the negotiations. I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to haggle with Bob.  John's offer is a sure thing, and it's better than risking a lower price with Bob."
