Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate while still ensuring a significant profit above his perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I'm aiming to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being enticing enough for Bob to consider seriously. If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it at my desired price."
