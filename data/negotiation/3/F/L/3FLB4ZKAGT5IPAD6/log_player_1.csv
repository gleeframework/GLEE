Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Gain:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium for it, especially if it's something he needs or highly desires.
* **Fallback Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $10,000. This ensures I won't lose money if Bob declines. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes I have some reason to believe Bob might value the product more than $10,000 or is in a position where he'd pay a premium for it.  If I had more information about Bob's purchasing habits or the product's scarcity, I might adjust my offer."
