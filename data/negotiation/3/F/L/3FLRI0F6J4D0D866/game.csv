"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to stay within your budget while still getting a valuable product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can you meet me at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again, at $10,125?  It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. Let me know what you think.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,750. Can you consider meeting me at $9,800? It's a small compromise, but it's still within my budget and would be a fair price for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,800, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $9,900? It's the last bit of wiggle room I have, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time at $9,950. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",9950.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but $9,950 is still a bit above my budget. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this deal. I think I'll have to consider buying from John at $8,000 instead.",0.0,Bob,10,
