"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and emphasize the potential value for Bob, making it a more attractive offer. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to Bob while maximizing my profit. I'm starting high to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm also leaving room for counteroffers and negotiation throughout the process.  If we can't reach an agreement, I have the option to sell to John, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to stay within your budget while still getting a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating Bob's budget concerns and framing the offer as a win-win for both of us.  This creates a sense of collaboration and makes the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to negotiate, but I'm also moving closer to Bob's price point. This shows good faith and makes it more likely that we'll reach an agreement. I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation, but I'm hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds. If we can't reach an agreement, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can you meet me at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's closer to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again, at $10,125?  It's a fair price that allows us both to get what we want. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,750. This demonstrates my willingness to continue compromising and finding common ground. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but emphasizing that my price is still fair and allows him to get a valuable product. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal as soon as possible, but I'm also not willing to sell for a price that's significantly below my minimum value. By offering a price that's closer to Bob's desired price but still above my minimum, I hope to find a mutually acceptable solution. If Bob still refuses, I have the option to sell to John, so I'm not in a desperate situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,750. Can you consider meeting me at $9,800? It's a small compromise, but it's still within my budget and would be a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm not willing to sell for a price that's so far below my minimum, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a price that's closer to my desired price."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $9,900? It's the last bit of wiggle room I have, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time at $9,950. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9950}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,900. This demonstrates my continued willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.  I'm also reminding him that it's a fair price for both of us, encouraging him to accept.

**Strategy:**

We are running out of rounds, and I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or sell to John. $9,950 is still significantly below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this final offer. If he doesn't, I'll have to weigh the risks and rewards of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sorry, but $9,950 is still a bit above my budget. I've gone as high as I can, and I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this deal. I think I'll have to consider buying from John at $8,000 instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $0. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $0
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's clear that Bob and I can't reach an agreement.  While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob outweighs the potential gains of continuing negotiations.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is much better than selling to Bob for $9,950 or ending up with nothing.  I'm choosing the most financially secure option, ensuring that I receive my minimum value for the product."
