"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. While it's worth significantly more to me, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price point that reflects its value to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This price allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a substantial discount, while still leaving me a comfortable profit. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
