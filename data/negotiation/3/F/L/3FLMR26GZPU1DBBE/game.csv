"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than $950,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair compromise considering the significant savings I'm offering you over John's price.  Let's close this deal and make it mutually beneficial.",975000.0,Bob,4,
