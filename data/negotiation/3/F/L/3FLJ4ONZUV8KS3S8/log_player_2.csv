"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is still above your desired price point.  It makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  However, I'm still a bit over budget. I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to sell at $10500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your desired price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target of $10,500.  While buying from John is an option, you still have a chance to save money by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $11,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $11000, but I'm still not ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11500. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you have a few rounds left and you're not keen on buying from John at $12,000.  You can try to meet Alice halfway again with a slightly higher counteroffer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up a little bit more, but $11,500 is still a stretch.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $11250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11750. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price.  With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate further and get to your desired price point.  While buying from John is not ideal, it's the most sensible option at this point to avoid further delays and secure the product within your budget. You're still saving $500 compared to John's initial price, which is a decent saving considering your initial goal."
