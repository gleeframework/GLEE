"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might prompt Alice to lower her price further, getting you closer to the $1,000,000 she values the product at. 

You still have John as a backup option, ensuring you won't be left without the product."
