"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While $900,000 is a tempting offer,  the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, I need to be upfront - $950,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000. This is the best I can do.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",980000.0,Bob,6,
