Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but my last offer was a significant step to meet you halfway.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and her latest offer still significantly exceeds your budget. Her mention of another buyer might be a negotiating tactic, and even if true, chasing a lower price with her at this point has risks:

* **Time Pressure:** You're running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice will drop her price sufficiently.
* **Potential Deal Loss:**  If she's serious about the other buyer, you could lose the opportunity altogether.

John's offer provides a guaranteed price point within your budget, eliminating further risk and potential negotiation fatigue."
