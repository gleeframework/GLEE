"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a risky move, but I believe I can get a better price than $1,200,000.  It's important to remember that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, so selling to John is always an option if negotiations break down completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'll offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to accept it yet.  I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,400,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,325,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,325,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,340,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,320,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but with only two rounds left, there's a high risk of ending up with an undesirable outcome. Bob is showing a pattern of only moving $25,000 per round, so I'm unlikely to get a significantly better offer in the next round.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
