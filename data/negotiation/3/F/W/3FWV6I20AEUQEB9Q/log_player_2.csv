# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Alice's offer:

I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?

While Alice is coming down in price, it's clear she is unlikely to reach my $8,000 limit. It's better to secure the known price from John than risk further negotiation with Alice.
