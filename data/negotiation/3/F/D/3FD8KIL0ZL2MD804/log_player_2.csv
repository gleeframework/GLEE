"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. Let's meet in the middle, I think this is fair for both of us.

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a good deal for you. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so you're saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer is the best option in this situation."
