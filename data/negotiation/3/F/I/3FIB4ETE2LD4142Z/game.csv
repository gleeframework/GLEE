"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds value for you, but I have a firm budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This offer stands as my final offer. ",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750.  This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",13750.0,Alice,5,
