Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750.  This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while it's above your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise to avoid losing the deal entirely. Continuing to push for $12,500 might make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at your maximum budget anyway."
