"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer is decent, you know you can get the product for $10 less from John.  You're better off going with the guaranteed lower price."
