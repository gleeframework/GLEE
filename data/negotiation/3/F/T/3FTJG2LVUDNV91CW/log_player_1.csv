Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or potentially get a better deal from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still below what I consider the product to be worth. I'm hoping to get a better price in the next round.  I still have more negotiating room, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's split the difference and settle on $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
