"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  This way, I can potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $135?  I'm sure we can find a price that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
 
I'm sticking with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. I'm also reinforcing the idea of a fair deal for both of us."
