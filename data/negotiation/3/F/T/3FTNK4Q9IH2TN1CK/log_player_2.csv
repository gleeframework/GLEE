{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I'll reject and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $90 is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping she'll take it to avoid going through more rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high, but getting closer. I'll reject and see if I can get it down further before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still holding out for a better price. I think $95 is a fair compromise, and it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, I'm still hoping to get it down to $100 or less. I'll reject and counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm going to offer Alice my maximum price. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and if she rejects it, I'll just buy from John."
