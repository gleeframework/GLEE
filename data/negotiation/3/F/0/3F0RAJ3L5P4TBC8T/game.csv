"Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is quite high though. I'm thinking something closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value you'll gain from this unique product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but that price is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's a significant offer on my end.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
