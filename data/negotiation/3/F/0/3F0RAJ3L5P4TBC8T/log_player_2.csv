Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are close. I value the progress we've made.  To be completely transparent, $1,500,000 is my absolute bottom line. I believe this is a fair offer reflecting the true value of the product. Let me know if you're able to meet this.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her bottom line is $1,500,000.  This is above your maximum price of $1,000,000. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price.  It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
