"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $10,000 to you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I am offering it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair deal and hope you'll find it attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to me, there's still room for negotiation. I want to try to get a better deal and potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'd be happy to purchase it for $8,500. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you and aiming for a mutual beneficial agreement, I propose to sell the product to you for $9,000. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $9,000 is a reasonable price for me. It's closer to my target price than what John is offering, and there's no guarantee that I can negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds. Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a good price and move on."
