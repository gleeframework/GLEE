"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $90?  That way we both get a good deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
