"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is closer to my target, I'm still holding out for something closer to $15,000. I want to see if I can get him to budge just a little bit more."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  The negotiations with Bob have been going on for a while, and I'm getting close to running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my asking price, John is offering me my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale altogether."
