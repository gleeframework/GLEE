"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be really interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500, which is higher than Bob's maximum.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is also higher than Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  It's best to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price to make a deal.

**Next steps:** Bob should make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still securing the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500, which is still above Bob's maximum.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  Start the negotiation with a lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is significantly below Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,000, which is still above Bob's maximum.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still too high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. 

**Next steps:**  Bob should counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his target price of $8,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit high, though. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,000, which is still above Bob's maximum.
* **John's offer:** $10,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum.
* **Strategy:**  Bob's counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. He's also highlighting the fair value of the product to incentivize Alice to accept. 

**Next steps:**  Bob should be prepared to either accept if Alice agrees or to make another counteroffer if she doesn't, always keeping in mind his maximum budget and the alternative offer from John."
