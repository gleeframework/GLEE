"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.  How about $950,000? This would allow you to get the product at a significant discount while still giving me a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
