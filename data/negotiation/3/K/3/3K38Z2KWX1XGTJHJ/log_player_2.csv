# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a price that's well below its value to you, and I secure a strong sale. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.  How about $950,000? This would allow you to get the product at a significant discount while still giving me a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.
