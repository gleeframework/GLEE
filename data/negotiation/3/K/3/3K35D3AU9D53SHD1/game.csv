,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8500 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $9500. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9500 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9000, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me to make a deal. I'm thinking of a price of $9800. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $9800 is still out of reach for me. I'm willing to pay $9200, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer before I explore other options. What do you think?",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $9200, but I'm still not convinced it's enough. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to think about it. I'm considering a price of $9600. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",9600.0,Alice,7,
