Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering your asking price and the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. This is a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
