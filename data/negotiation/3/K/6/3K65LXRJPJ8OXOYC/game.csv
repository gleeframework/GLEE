"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've invested a lot in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $175. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate it. However, $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $160?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's the absolute most I can do.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a bit more than $160 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $165? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this.  $165 is still a bit more than I had hoped for.  Could you come down to $162?  That's the absolute final price I can do.",162.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I've already made a few concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $163, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price, considering the value this product offers.",163.0,Alice,7,
