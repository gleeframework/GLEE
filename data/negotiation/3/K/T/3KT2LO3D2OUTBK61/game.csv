"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's true worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
