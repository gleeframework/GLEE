"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to maximize profit. Starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness.  A quick acceptance would be ideal, but a counteroffer gives us information to work with.
* **Alternative Option:**  The standing offer from John provides a safety net. We can always walk away if negotiations with Bob become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer does show he's willing to negotiate, accepting at this point would mean a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We're coming down from our initial high offer, signaling flexibility. However, the decrease is substantial enough to encourage Bob to move closer to our desired range.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** The $1,450,000 counteroffer keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum. It emphasizes the value of the product while leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Time Consideration:**  While we have time, each round brings us closer to potentially accepting John's offer. A slightly quicker pace in our concessions might encourage a faster resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
