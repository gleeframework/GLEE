"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this amazing product for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice for $100 is cheaper than buying from John for $120.
* **You're still saving money:** Even at $100, you're getting the product for less than your maximum price of $120."
