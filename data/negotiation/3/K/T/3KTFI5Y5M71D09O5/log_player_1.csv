Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could accept his offer and make a profit, it's not maximizing my potential earnings.  I will counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your position, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,350,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000 as a final compromise.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,300,000.  I've reached a point where I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob.  There are only a few rounds left, and I need to secure a price that's closer to my minimum.  Selling to John ensures I get my target price and avoid any further risk of a lower offer from Bob."
