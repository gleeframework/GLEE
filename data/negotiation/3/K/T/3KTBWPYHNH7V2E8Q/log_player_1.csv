Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a little room to negotiate, while still ensuring a good profit for Alice. This strategy aims to maximize Alice's earnings while also keeping the negotiation open to ensure a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $12000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is still a significant amount of money, it's below Alice's minimum value for the product ($15,000).  It's better to reject his offer and continue negotiations to see if a more favorable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $13,500 for this product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a deal closer to my budget. I would like to propose $13000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to Alice's desired price point. While it is still below her minimum of $15,000, it is a good compromise and a reasonable amount of profit considering the potential for continued negotiations and the risk of Bob walking away."
