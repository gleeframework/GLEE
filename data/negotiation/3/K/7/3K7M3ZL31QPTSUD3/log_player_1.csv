Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, $175 is a decent starting point to see if he's interested. It's above my minimum of $150, but gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is too low for me. It's below my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer waiting to purchase at that price."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum of $150.  While I'm open to negotiating, I don't want to go any lower. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $150, so I'll sell to him and avoid further negotiations."
