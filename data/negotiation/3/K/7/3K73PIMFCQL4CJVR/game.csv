,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $80 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about $95? It's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we try $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit further. How about $92.50? This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,6,
