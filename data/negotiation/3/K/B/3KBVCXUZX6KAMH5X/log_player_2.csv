It's always better to try to negotiate with Alice.  You can potentially get a better price than $1,000,000 from her."

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within the range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. I'm hoping to get the price down as close as possible to my maximum of $1,000,000."

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm going to try and split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer.  This is hopefully close enough to her target price to get her to accept."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is now within my acceptable range. While I can still try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my offer again and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's safer to accept her offer and secure the product."
