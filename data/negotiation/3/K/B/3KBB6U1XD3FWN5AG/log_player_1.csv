I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiation.  If Bob is truly interested, he'll counter-offer. If he rejects outright, I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm going to try to get a better price. Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, so I'll see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still keeping the price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to $900,000, Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant improvement over his initial offer.  This is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
