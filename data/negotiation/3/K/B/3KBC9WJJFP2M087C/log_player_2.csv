"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,000 is less than the price from John, there is room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,500, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $12,000. This is a bold move, but it reflects Bob's desire to save as much money as possible.  The offer is still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000, so there's potential for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and is still higher than Alice's minimum value of $8,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks the possibility that Alice will withdraw the offer or become unwilling to sell.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a favorable price."
