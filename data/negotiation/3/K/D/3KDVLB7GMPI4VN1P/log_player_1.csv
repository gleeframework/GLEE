"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:**  My message highlights the potential benefit to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **10 Rounds:**  I'm aware of the limited rounds and aim to strike a balance between being aggressive and leaving room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even lower than my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's counteroffer isn't enticing enough to accept immediately. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum,  hopefully leading to a more favorable outcome.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob before making a decision."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product while considering your budget.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum and closer to my desired outcome.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to justify the price and make it clear that I'm not just throwing out random numbers.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** My message aims to create a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to consider a compromise.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I'm aware of the time constraint and want to find a solution in a reasonable number of rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is still an option, I'm optimistic that a deal with Bob is achievable, especially if I can bring the price down to $1,300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price, especially with a few rounds remaining. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer as a fallback option, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to push for a price closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your budget constraints.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's only $50,000 higher than Bob's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the word ""compromise"" to reinforce the idea that I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Urgency:** The message subtly implies a sense of urgency to close the deal. 
* **Value and Budget:** I reiterate the value of the product and Bob's budget constraints to justify the price. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer, but I want to see if I can get a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is still below my initial goal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  If I reject this offer, I might not get a better one.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, it's not significantly better than Bob's offer.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of running out of time. 
* **Strategic Decision:**  Accepting Bob's offer is a strategic decision to maximize my earnings while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
