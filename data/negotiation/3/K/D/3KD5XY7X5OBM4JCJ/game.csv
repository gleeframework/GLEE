"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, that starting price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I've given this a lot of thought, and to be frank, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's a fair price that acknowledges the value while working for me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
