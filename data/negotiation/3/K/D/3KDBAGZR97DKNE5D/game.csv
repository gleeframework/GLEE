"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get us started. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is far too high for me. While I see the value in this product, my budget is significantly lower. To make this work, I'd be willing to offer $700,000. This reflects a significant discount for you and lets us both walk away happy. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident this product is worth a lot to me, but I need to stay within my financial limits.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This would be a substantial gain for you and would allow me to acquire the product within my budget. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I understand your position,  $900,000 is still too high for me.  I am very interested in this product and believe it has a lot of value for my business. To make this work, I'm going to need to stay closer to $800,000. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product.  This would be a win for both of us, as you'd still receive a significant profit, and I'd be able to acquire the product within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,6,
