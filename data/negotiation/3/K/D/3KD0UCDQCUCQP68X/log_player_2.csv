"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's best to reject and see if you can get a better price in the next round. You have a strong backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into a deal that isn't the best possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $950,000 offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness about the deal while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to *you*, aligning with your goal of saving money.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The closing statement leaves the door open for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above your maximum budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your goal. 

John is always a safe alternative, but there's a chance you can secure a better deal with Alice if you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer is your absolute maximum price, but it's also the same price you can get from John. It shows Alice that you're serious about acquiring the product but are not willing to pay more than your limit. 
* **Emphasize value for both:** The message highlights the fair price for both parties, making it a win-win scenario.
* **Finality:** The message conveys that this is your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
