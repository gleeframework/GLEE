While it's tempting to take the $100, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  There are still 6 rounds left, and you might be able to get a slightly higher price."

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to stick to my original request of $100 if possible. I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

It's time to cut our losses. We've reached a stalemate, and we're running out of time.  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $100, which is our minimum price. It's better to secure the deal than to risk getting nothing at all."
