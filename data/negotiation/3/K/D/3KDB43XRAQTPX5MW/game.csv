"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but $9500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $10500, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll counteroffer at $10750. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",10750.0,Alice,5,
