Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $150 as possible, her guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $149 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below the guaranteed sale price makes the offer seem more attractive to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept any offer above $100. This strategy simply maximizes Alice's potential profit."
