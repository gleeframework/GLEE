"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  It's just a small step up from your offer, but it allows me to stay closer to my target price.  What do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to do one more compromise. Let's meet at $94. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the deal.  What do you think?",94.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $91? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my limits.",91.0,Bob,8,
