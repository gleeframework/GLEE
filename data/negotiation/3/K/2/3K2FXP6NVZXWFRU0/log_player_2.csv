Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my limit. I will reject and try to counteroffer again."

Alice's offer is still above my limit of $12,000.  I've already made two counteroffers, and she's not budging much.  It's time to move on and buy from John.  I'm happy to get the product for $12,000 and avoid further negotiation."
