Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of this product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough.  I have a few more rounds, so I'm going to try to push for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $950,000 is still too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay at $980,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $970,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by pushing for a higher price."
