I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. If Bob rejects the offer, I'm confident I can still sell to John for $10,000. This strategy gives me the potential to make more money, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
