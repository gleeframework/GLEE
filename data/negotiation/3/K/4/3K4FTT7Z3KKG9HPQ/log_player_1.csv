"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still attractive to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'd need to go a bit higher. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm raising the price slightly, hoping to split the difference with Bob. I'm still keeping it below my ideal price but emphasizing the value and the fairness of the offer."
