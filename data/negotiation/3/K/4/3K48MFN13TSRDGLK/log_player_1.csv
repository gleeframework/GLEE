"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still keeping Bob interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price slightly to $900,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will entice him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I still believe we can reach a price closer to my desired range. I'm going to counteroffer again in hopes of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm going to drop my price slightly again to $890,000. This is getting closer to Bob's last offer, and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to meet me halfway."
