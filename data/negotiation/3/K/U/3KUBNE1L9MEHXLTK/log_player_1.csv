{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to leave some room for negotiation. This also shows I'm confident in the product's value.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $92.50 is very close to my minimum price of $90, and it's a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing the sale to Bob entirely.  This is a good outcome."
