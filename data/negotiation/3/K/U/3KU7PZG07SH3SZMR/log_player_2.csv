Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to your desired price, you're still paying more than you'd like. There's still room for negotiation, and you should try to get the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $15,000, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!

Alice has made her final offer, and it's still above your budget. While there's always the chance she might budge further, it's not guaranteed. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $15,000, securing the product at your desired price and avoiding further negotiation."
