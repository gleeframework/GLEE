"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to make it happen. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see significant returns on your investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have John as a backup option at $1,000,000.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or have to settle for John's price. By rejecting this offer, you aim to explore if a better deal is possible."
