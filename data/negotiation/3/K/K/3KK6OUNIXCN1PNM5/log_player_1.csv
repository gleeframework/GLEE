Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is still too high a price point for me.  There's clearly a gap between our valuations. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. How about $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob is firmly rooted at his valuation and isn't budging. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and it's costing us time. Accepting his offer is a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed purchase."
