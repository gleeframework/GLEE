"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is still too high a price point for me.  There's clearly a gap between our valuations. Perhaps we can find a middle ground. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
