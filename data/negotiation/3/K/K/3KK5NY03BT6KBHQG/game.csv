"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects the immense value it holds, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly less than what I  can accept for this product.  To be realistic, I could consider coming down to $1,800,000. This is taking into account the unique value and potential this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and represents a real compromise on my end. I hope you'll consider it.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. To meet you halfway, I can drop my price to $1,650,000. This is my final offer.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial limits.  I hope you'll consider it, as I'm eager to finalize this purchase.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
