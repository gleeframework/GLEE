Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and represents a real compromise on my end. I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial limits.  I hope you'll consider it, as I'm eager to finalize this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
