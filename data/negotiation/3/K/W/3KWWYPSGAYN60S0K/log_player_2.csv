Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that I'm comfortable with.  This is a strong opening move to gauge Alice's flexibility and see if she's willing to negotiate."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $120. It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm not willing to pay $120, so I'll continue negotiating. There's still room for compromise and I might be able to get a better price."

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $80 to $95. This shows a willingness to compromise but still keeps me below my maximum budget.  It also leaves some room for further negotiation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
