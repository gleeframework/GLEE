"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still get a better deal. He knows John is willing to sell for $8,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and continuing negotiation is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for the $8,000 price. While Alice has moved closer, $9,500 is still above his target.  He can try to negotiate further, potentially meeting Alice halfway again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down to $8,000. While Alice has come down significantly, $9,250 is still more than Bob wants to pay. Since he has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to take that route and save the extra $1,250.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice not budging further and losing the deal with John outweighs the potential savings."
