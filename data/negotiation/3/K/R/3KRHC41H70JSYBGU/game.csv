"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is just too low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we compromise at $15,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's also close to my minimum. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $15,500, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $14,750? I think that's a fair price for the product.",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,750 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",15250.0,Alice,7,

"I've made a serious offer at $15,000. I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",15000.0,Bob,8,
