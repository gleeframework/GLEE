"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1400000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the value and potential of the product. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 doesn't quite work for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop to $1600000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping it's a price we can both agree on.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
