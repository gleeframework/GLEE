Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the value and potential of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $1,300,000, I'm not comfortable going that low yet. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price and feel like I'm getting a fair deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 doesn't quite work for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping it's a price we can both agree on.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  he's not quite there yet, and I've only got four rounds left. There's no guarantee I'll be able to reach an agreement with him before the time runs out. 

Selling to John guarantees me a safe and reasonable price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
