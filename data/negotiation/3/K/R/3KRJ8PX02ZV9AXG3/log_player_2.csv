"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it! I'm looking for $150 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This offer is too high. The product is only worth $120 to me, and I can always get it from John for that price. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $150 to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider selling it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It will be interesting to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll try countering closer to my limit to see if she's flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy it at that price."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counteroffer is getting closer to my limit, but it still allows for a little negotiation. By expressing that I'm ready to buy at this price, I'm hoping to signal to Alice that it's a good deal for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! I can do a bit better than $110. How about $125? I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125, and it's not worth haggling over $5. I can get the product for my target price from John."
