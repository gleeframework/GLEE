"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the product's unique value justifies a higher price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? This allows us both to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
