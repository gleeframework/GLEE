"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $87.50. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice's counteroffer of $87.50 is still within Bob's budget of $100 and is a better deal than buying from John.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the next offer and potentially leading to a higher price from John makes accepting her current offer the most logical choice."
