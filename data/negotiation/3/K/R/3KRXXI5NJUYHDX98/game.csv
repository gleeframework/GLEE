"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $9,000? That's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but no further. That's the final offer I'm willing to make.",8500.0,Bob,6,
