"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $130, but I was thinking more along the lines of $142. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",142.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $142 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $136.  That way we both get a good deal.",136.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit above $136. How about we aim for $139? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",139.0,Alice,5,
