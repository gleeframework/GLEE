"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I still feel that the product could be acquired for less. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product.
