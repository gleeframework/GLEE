"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
I'm still hoping to get a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,500 to meet you halfway. It's a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm running out of rounds. Accepting Bob's offer of $9,000 is still a good profit, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000."
