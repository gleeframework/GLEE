"I appreciate the unique opportunity to acquire this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident it's worth significantly more. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This offer reflects my belief in the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing me to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you've been very clear about your budgetary constraints, and I respect that.  However, I need to be firm on the value of this product.  My final offer is $1,225,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I hope you can recognize the value it represents.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,225,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while allowing me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
