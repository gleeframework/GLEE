Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price point of $80. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $85? It's still a great price for a product you value at $80."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still looking to keep the price below $80. Could we agree on $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal of maximizing profit. I'm going to try to get Bob to come up a bit more."
