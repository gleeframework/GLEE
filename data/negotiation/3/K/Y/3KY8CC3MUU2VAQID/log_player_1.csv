"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I believe this strategy maximizes my potential earnings while leaving open the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price in the next round, hoping to reach a compromise that is more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price within a few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to my desired price and is a good compromise.  I'll accept his offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
