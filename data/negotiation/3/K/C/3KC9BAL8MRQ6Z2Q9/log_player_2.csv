"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's a good deal at $8,000, but it's worth seeing if you can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $6,000 is a significant discount from her original price, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my price, but $7,500 is still a bit too high. I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to $7,000. This is a compromise between Alice's last offer and my previous offer.  It's getting closer to a potential deal, but I'm still trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  At $7,200, it's a good deal considering my maximum budget and the fact that I'm already in round 5. It's better to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more or buying from John at a much higher price."
