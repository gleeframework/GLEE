Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter.  This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm hoping to squeeze a bit more out of Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, considering his initial offer was so low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time to a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure if we'll reach an agreement.  Rather than risk further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is a guaranteed sale and it's closer to my desired price."
