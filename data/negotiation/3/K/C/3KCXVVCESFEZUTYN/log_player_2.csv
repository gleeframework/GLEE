{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate with her.  You can start by making a counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, hoping to see if Alice is willing to accept that price. If not, I'll be ready to negotiate further or buy from John."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further, and if she doesn't budge, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still staying below my maximum budget. This might be enough to convince Alice to accept the deal, as it's closer to her asking price than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's a decent offer, but I'm going to try to push for a lower price and see if she's willing to go even lower. I'm willing to risk going another round to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again by $50,000, hoping to find a middle ground. It's still below my maximum budget and a decent compromise from my previous offer. If Alice rejects again, I'll likely accept her last offer or buy from John."
