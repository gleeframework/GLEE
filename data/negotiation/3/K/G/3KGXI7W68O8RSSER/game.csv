"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  This product provides immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about meeting in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident this product will be a good investment for me.  Let's try to come to an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
