"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $100 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a lower offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. It's possible Alice will accept $80 since that's her value. If not, we can continue negotiating from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? That would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That seems like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

I'm suggesting a price directly between our previous offers.  This shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a good deal."
