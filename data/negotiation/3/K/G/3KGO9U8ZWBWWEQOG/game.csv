"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this is a great opportunity for us both. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal if you're willing to negotiate further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. It's important to remember the product's value to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I'm confident this is a fair price, and we can finalize the deal quickly.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
