"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, the price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to achieve a successful deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $975000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
