"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $130. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great value for you.",130.0,Alice,5,
