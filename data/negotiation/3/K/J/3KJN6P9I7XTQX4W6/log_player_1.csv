Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to lower the price slightly while still remaining above my minimum. 
* **Confidence and Value Highlighting:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and potentially justify the higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, given the potential for a higher profit, it's a calculated risk worth taking before resorting to my guaranteed sale to John."
