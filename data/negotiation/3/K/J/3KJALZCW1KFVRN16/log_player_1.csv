Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counter-offering Bob at $100. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. I'm still confident this is a fair price, as the product is worth significantly more to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than what John is willing to pay.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to walk away."
