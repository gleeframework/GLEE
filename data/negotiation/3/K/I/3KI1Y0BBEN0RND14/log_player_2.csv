"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice, as her initial offer is quite close to my maximum budget. There's a chance I can get it for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and show interest:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a smooth negotiation.
* **Establish a lower anchor:** By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, I aim to shift the negotiation towards a more favorable price for me.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I don't want to lowball Alice and risk her ending the negotiation, so I'm leaving space for us to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to my target while still acknowledging her need to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle on $120?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Direct and to the point:** Time to be clear about my desired price. 
* **Fairness emphasis:** Highlighting fairness encourages Alice to see the compromise as mutually beneficial.
* **Potential endpoint:** This offer is my ideal price.  Alice might accept, ending the negotiation successfully."
