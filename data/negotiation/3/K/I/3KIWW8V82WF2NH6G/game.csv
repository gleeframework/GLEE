"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true market value. I could consider letting it go for $900,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest,  $750,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $875,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",875000.0,Alice,5,
