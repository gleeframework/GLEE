"Bob, I have a product I think would be of great value to you. It's worth $800,000 to me, and I believe it would be similarly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
