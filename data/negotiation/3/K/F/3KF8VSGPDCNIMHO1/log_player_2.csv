"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think would be of great value to you. It's worth $800,000 to me, and I believe it would be similarly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Since you can get the product from John for $800,000, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most cost-effective option."
