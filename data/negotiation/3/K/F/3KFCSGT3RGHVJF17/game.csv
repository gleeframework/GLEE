"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking to my original offer of $12,000. It's the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",14500.0,Alice,5,
