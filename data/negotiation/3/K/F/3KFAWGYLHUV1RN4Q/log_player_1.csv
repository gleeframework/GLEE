Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay above our minimum. Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe my initial offer is closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the immense value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you're asking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting close, but Bob's offer is still too low. We'll counter with a price closer to our minimum, putting pressure on him to either meet us closer or risk losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but we're reaching a critical point. To be frank, $1,300,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This offer reflects the product's true worth and my desire to reach a fair deal. I believe it's more than reasonable considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're asking for, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,050,000 is a substantial profit, even if it's less than our initial target. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Alternative:** John's offer is only $1,000,000. Accepting Bob's offer nets us an extra $50,000. 

While we could push for more, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely."
