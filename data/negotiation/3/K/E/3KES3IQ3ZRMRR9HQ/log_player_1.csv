{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly approach and  offers a price point slightly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this strategy maximizes the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and it's important to remember my minimum selling price is $15,000. While I could sell to John now and guarantee that price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $12,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 12000}
