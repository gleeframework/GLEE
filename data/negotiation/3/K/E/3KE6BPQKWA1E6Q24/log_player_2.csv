"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, there's no financial benefit to rejecting her offer and buying from John.  You're getting the product at your maximum price point, so accepting is the best option."
