"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not ideal:**  You'd save $500 compared to buying from John. 
* **You want to save more:**  There's room to negotiate further with Alice to try and get a price closer to your $8,000 value. 
* **Rejecting the offer opens up negotiation:** By rejecting, you signal that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This gives you leverage."
