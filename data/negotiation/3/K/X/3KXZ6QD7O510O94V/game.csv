"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000,  which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,150,000. However, it's still a bit too far from where I need to be.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this final offer - $1,225,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're open to it.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
