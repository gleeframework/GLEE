# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth $1,200,000 to you, so you'll be getting a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to see if she'll come down further in price, potentially saving you even more money."
