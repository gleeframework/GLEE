Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is within my budget and a good compromise. It's still cheaper than buying from John, so accepting this offer is the best course of action."
