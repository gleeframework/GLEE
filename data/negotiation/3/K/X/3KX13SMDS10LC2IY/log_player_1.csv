"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000.  This is a strong opening offer, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. Bob's low offer shows he's trying to get a bargain. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $13,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm starting to run out of rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
