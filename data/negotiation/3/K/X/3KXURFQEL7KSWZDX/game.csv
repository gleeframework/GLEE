"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I've done some research and I believe that's a more reasonable price for this type of product. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $10500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $9500. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. Considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10200. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $10200 is a bit too high. I'm willing to offer $9800, which is my final offer. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. If you can meet me at this price, I'll make the purchase. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John.",9500.0,Bob,8,
