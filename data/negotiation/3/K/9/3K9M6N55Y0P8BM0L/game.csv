"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering,  $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer further.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your offer while still ensuring a fair transaction, I propose we negotiate the price to $9500. This would allow us both to benefit from the product without straining your budget too much.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product and my budget constraints. What are your thoughts?",8500.0,Bob,4,
