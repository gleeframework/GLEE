"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm hoping to get the price down a bit closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think it's a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $9,500 to $9,200. This is a good price for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $12,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,800 compared to buying from John. While there's always the potential for a lower price,  the risk of further negotiation potentially ending with a higher price or losing the deal outweighs the potential gain."
