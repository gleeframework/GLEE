"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's value and potential for Bob's business, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Negotiation:** I'm setting the stage for a negotiation and giving Bob a chance to make a counteroffer.

**Important Note:** While I'm aiming for the highest price, I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit and the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll need to adjust my strategy as the negotiations progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my starting price, but still within the realm of possibility. 
* **Staying Firm:** It's too early in the negotiation to accept his offer. I need to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm still hoping to secure a better price from Bob. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I have time to explore more options. 

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in round 3, aiming for a price closer to my desired value, but still leaving room for potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $1,075,000? This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price but still demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness:**  The $1,075,000 price is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a fair negotiation.
* **Value Reiteration:**  I'm reminding Bob of the unique value of the product to justify the price. 

**Strategy:** By meeting halfway, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about negotiating, while still maintaining a position that's within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1025000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while ensuring I can acquire the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my desired price.
* **Time Consideration:**  We are already in round 4, and while I'd love to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether increases with each passing round.
* **John's Offer:** Although John's offer of $1,000,000 is secure, Bob's current offer is higher.

**Decision:**  It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer. The price is within a reasonable range, and it's unlikely that I'll be able to significantly improve on this offer in the remaining rounds."
