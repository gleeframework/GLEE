Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a relatively high price, aiming for a good profit. 
*  $18,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* This will give me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. 

Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
