Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I can likely get a higher price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counter-offering at $130. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still a good price for me, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
