Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have another offer for $8,000, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and my previous offer of $8,200.

Alice is unlikely to budge further, and while $8,100 isn't a terrible price, you have a guaranteed offer for $8,000. Take the sure thing and buy from John."
