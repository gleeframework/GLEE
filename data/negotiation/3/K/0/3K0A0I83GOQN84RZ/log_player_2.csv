"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. Rejecting allows him to counteroffer again and try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I appreciate that. However, $10,875 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,250 and $10,875, which would be $11,062.50. That's my best offer for now. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,062.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price, but further negotiation may not yield a much lower price.  $11,062.5 is still better than John's price and a fair compromise. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product without significantly delaying the purchase."
