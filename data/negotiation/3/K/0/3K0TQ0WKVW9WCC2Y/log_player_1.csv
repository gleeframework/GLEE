Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing he values it at $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price well above your minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
