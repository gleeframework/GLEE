"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know John will sell the product for $150, it makes sense to buy from John immediately. There's no need to negotiate with Alice if you're comfortable with the price John is offering."
