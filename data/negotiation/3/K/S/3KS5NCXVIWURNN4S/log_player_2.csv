"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. You're willing to pay no more than $8,000, and her starting price is $22,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer and seeing if you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $22,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm prepared to offer $8,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle on $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While she's come down from $22,000,  $18,000 is still above your maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get her closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $18,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer to a fair deal, I can't let it go for less than $16,000.  I'm confident you'll find incredible value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above your maximum budget. While you are willing to go up to $10,000, it's worth pushing for a lower price. It's better to keep negotiating and see if you can get her closer to your target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  $16,000 is still quite a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
