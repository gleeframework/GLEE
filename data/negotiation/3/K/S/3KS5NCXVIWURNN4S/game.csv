"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $22,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm prepared to offer $8,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle on $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $18,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer to a fair deal, I can't let it go for less than $16,000.  I'm confident you'll find incredible value at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $16,000 is still quite a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
