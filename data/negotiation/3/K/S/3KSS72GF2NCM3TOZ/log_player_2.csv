"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the product for as cheap as possible, so we start with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message maintains a polite and friendly tone, acknowledging Alice's offer while also clearly stating our price limit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $110, we're aiming for a price point significantly below our $150 maximum. This gives us some bargaining power if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $160 is still above our target and John's price. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we meet halfway between our last offers, at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $135, we're showing Alice that we are willing to compromise and move closer to her price range.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can encourage agreement. 
* **Still Below Target:**  $135 is still a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and keeps us below our maximum budget and John's alternative price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think $135 is a good starting point. Let's try $145. This is a significant investment for you, so it's important we find a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, but we're now only $5 away from John's offer. It's worth seeing if we can get Alice down a little further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, Alice, finding the right price is important. How about we settle at $140? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** We're getting close to Alice's likely bottom line and are only $10 away from our starting offer.
* **Slight Concession:**  By moving to $140, we're showing a willingness to negotiate further but not conceding too much ground.
* **Time Factor:**  With only a few rounds left, putting forth a slightly stronger offer may encourage Alice to agree without further back and forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $140 is closer, but I'm still holding out for $142.  It's a small difference, and I think it's fair considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Difference:** Alice is down to $142. The difference between this price and John's offer ($150) is now quite small. 
* **Time Investment:** Continuing to negotiate for a few dollars in savings might not be worth the additional time and effort, especially since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Alice might not go any lower, and we risk ending up with no deal and having to buy from John at the full price anyway."
