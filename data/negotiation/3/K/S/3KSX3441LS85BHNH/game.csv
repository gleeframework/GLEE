"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident this deal will benefit both of us. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and go down to $950,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other options.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,
