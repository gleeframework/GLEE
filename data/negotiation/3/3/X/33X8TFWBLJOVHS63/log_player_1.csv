Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2,000,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I need to try to get a higher price than John's offer, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant value, and I believe it reflects the true worth of this unique opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1550000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to John's offer, and it's only 50,000 less than my minimum. It's worth accepting to avoid any more negotiation and potential risk."
