Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $125 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $135.  Let's make this deal happen!

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we've managed to get the price down to $135, which is a $15 savings.  While we could try to push for $125 again, there's a risk Alice might be less flexible now. Accepting at $135 seems like a reasonable compromise."
