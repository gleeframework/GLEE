"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I want to establish a positive relationship and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  Offering a reason for the price (even if it's not fully accurate) can make the offer seem more justified.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round.  We'll need to see Bob's reaction and adjust our strategy as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  While I want to make a deal, $90 is below my floor of $100.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **Building leverage:**  Rejecting this offer shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a better price.  It also sets up the possibility of getting a higher counteroffer from him in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to $100 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $95? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price (fair compromise) to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Target Price:** $95 is still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:** 

We'll see if Bob accepts this offer or counters with a different price.  If he counters, we'll need to analyze his offer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob has indicated this is his lowest offer, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John would secure me my minimum acceptable price, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before doing so.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $95.  I'll try to convince him that this is a fair price, highlighting the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. While I value this product highly, I'm trying to be fair. I can come down to $90, but that's my final offer. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by indicating this is my final offer. This might push Bob to reconsider. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and that this is a good deal for him.
* **Target Price:** $90 is closer to my minimum and still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters again.

**Next Steps:**

We'll see if Bob accepts this offer or counters again. If he counters, I'll need to weigh my options carefully. If his offer is too low, I might consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $87.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $87.5 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's Offer:** I'm getting closer to my minimum with Bob, but John's offer of $100 is still a better deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob says it's his best offer, there's still a chance he might come up a bit more. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer.  I'll aim for a price closer to $90, but I might be willing to go down to $95 if it means securing a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $92.50. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you're getting. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between his last offer ($87.5) and my previous offer ($95). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm highlighting the value proposition again, emphasizing that this is a good deal for Bob.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency, suggesting that this might be my final offer.

**Next Steps:**

We'll see if Bob accepts this offer. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to stick with my offer, counter with a slightly lower price, or finally accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $87.50, but I'm not going any higher. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer is Better:**  Bob's final offer of $87.5 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  John's offer guarantees me $100, which is a much better outcome for me.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  I've already made significant compromises, and there's little room for further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Selling to John now ensures a secure deal before I risk running out of time. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, John's offer is the best option available to me at this point.  It guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on a deal altogether by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
