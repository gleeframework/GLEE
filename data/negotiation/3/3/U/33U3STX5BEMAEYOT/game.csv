"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this valuable product. I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My starting price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,100,000? I think that's a fair deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, given the product's value to your business. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  I'm getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a touch too high for me. How about we settle at $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's meet at $1,225,000.  This would still be a very good deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product. What do you say?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly, to $1,190,000. That's the best I can do, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm feeling more optimistic about reaching an agreement. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,205,000? That seems fair for both of us. Let's close this deal!",1205000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're really in the ballpark now.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,195,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a very fair offer considering the market and I'm eager to get this deal done.",1195000.0,Bob,8,
