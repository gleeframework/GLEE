"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my original offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so how about we settle on $825,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price",825000.0,Bob,4,
