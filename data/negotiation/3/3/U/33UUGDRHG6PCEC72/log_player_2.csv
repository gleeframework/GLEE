"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,000,000. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price closer to my initial ask.  Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, leaving Bob with no product.  It's more strategic for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
