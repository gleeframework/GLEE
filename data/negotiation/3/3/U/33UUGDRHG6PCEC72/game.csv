"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price closer to my initial ask.  Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
