Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to what you can afford, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You'll be buying the product for $825,000, saving $375,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you might be able to push Alice a little lower in another round, there's a risk she won't budge, and you'll end up with John's higher price."
