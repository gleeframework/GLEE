"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very attractive price.  Let's discuss a figure that benefits us both.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price of $1,000,000.  You're trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option."
