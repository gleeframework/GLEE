Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by being too stubborn.  It's important to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a deal gets done."
