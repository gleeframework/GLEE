"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth more to me than that.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price further.  If she doesn't, you're still securing the best possible deal with John."
