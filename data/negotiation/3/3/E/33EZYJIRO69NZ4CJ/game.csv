"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm interested in the product, though, and I'd be willing to pay $16000.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit, but $18000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $16000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",16000.0,Bob,4,
