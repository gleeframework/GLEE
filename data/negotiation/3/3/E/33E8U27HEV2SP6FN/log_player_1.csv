Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's a fair distance above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation if necessary. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $12,000 if we can't reach an agreement with Bob, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the price is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal. It shows good faith and might encourage Bob to raise his offer again.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also possible that we'll get stuck in a loop of counteroffers and I'll end up selling to John for $12,000 anyway. Accepting this offer secures a sale and allows me to move on."
