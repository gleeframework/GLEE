{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $10,000, so $11,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:** You're not willing to go lower than $12,000, so this leaves you room to negotiate as well.
* **Friendly and encouraging:**  A positive tone might make Bob more likely to engage."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try and get a better price."

While I'm getting closer to Bob's price, $9,800 is still below my minimum.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
