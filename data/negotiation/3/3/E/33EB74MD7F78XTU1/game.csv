,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800, and that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,150? This is my final offer, so let me know what you think. ",10150.0,Alice,5,
