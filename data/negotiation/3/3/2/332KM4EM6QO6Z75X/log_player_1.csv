Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is likely to see this as a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you have space to adjust the price without losing too much. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is still a good profit, it's worth seeing if we can get closer to our initial asking price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 would be the lowest I could go. It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $122.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, the negotiation has gone back and forth a few times, and Bob's offer is only $2.50 away from our last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation won't yield much more profit, and  $122.50 is still a good price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures we close the deal and secure a good profit."
