Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $95."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $87.50 is a fair price. Can you meet me there?

While I'd prefer a bit more, $87.50 is still a decent price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
