"I'm interested in your product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a compromise here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. It's a fair price that reflects both of our needs. Let's close this deal now.
