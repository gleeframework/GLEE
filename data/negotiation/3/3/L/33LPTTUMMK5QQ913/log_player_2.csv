The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $135. That's a good price for her, but I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get it closer to my $150 limit."

I'm offering $125, which is still a good deal for Alice, and it's closer to my ideal price.  Let's see if she'll take it."

While $140 is closer to my limit, it's still a bit higher than I'd like. I'll counteroffer again. There's still room for negotiation."

I'm going to offer $130. It's a compromise between our last offers, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Alice to accept."

Alice is firm on her price, and $145 is too close to my limit.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $150. At least I'll be sure to get the product."
