"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I'm looking to sell it to you for $12000. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. There's no incentive to negotiate further as you can buy the same product from John for the same price."
