"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, $1,000,000  doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from $1,175,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
