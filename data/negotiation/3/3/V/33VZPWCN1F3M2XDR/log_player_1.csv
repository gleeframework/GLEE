"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to make a deal, $9,000 is far too low for me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,750 is still too far below my minimum. I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to keep negotiating, but I'm going to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9,750 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000. That's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
