"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm prepared to offer $550,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and provides a fair return for you. Let me know your thoughts.",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $650,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $650,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and provides a good return for you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this point.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to finalize the deal, but I'm not willing to accept $600,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll counteroffer $620,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",620000.0,Alice,5,
