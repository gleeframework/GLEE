"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, given its value to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $900000. Given the product's value to me, I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to be sure the price is right.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 doesn't reflect the true value this product will bring to your business. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a substantial gain for you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.  This price is fair and would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
