"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This price allows you to get a significant return on your investment, and it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your $15,000 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
