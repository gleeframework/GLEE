"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to $850000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think about $850000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $840000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $820000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",820000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot and I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $840000 and $820000. I'm thinking of a price of $830000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Alice, but I'm afraid I've already offered you my best price. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $820000. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept this offer or do I need to consider other options?",820000.0,Bob,8,
