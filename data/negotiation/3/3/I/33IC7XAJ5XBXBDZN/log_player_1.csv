"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  While $13,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still do better.  There's room for compromise, and I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about $13,500? I think that's fair given the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a price that's in the middle ground between our initial positions. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $13,200. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,200.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and represents a significant profit.  It's also likely that continuing to negotiate would only lead to more back and forth, potentially risking a breakdown in the negotiations.  I'm happy to secure this sale and move on."
