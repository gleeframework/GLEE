"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, it's too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you, given the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $700,000 is a significant gap.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair price considering its value.",800000.0,Bob,4,
