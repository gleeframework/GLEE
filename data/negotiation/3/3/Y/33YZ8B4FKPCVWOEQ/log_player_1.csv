``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also establishes a firm starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value for the product. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'm tempted to sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to come down to $10000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $9750. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9750. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I can't risk losing the sale altogether.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option for me at this point."
