"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $10000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad you're willing to come down to $10000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10000. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $9750. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. Let's close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9750. I'm willing to pay $9200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",9200.0,Bob,8,
