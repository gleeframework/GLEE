{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate above that price with Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Offering the product at $19,000 sets a strong anchor. While it's higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves space for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for you. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value might persuade Bob, even if the initial price is above his valuation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:**  The success of this offer depends on Bob's negotiation tactics and willingness to pay above his perceived value. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell the product quickly, you might consider a lower price to ensure a sale to Bob."
