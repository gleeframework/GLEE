"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $10,000 is a good deal for me and ensures a profit.  It's getting close to the end of our rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
