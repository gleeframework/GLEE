"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe you would find extremely valuable. It's something that aligns perfectly with your interests and could significantly benefit your endeavors. I'm offering it to you for $10,500, knowing it's worth at least that much to you. If you're interested, let's discuss further.  Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another interested party for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice is trying to bluff you by saying she'll sell it to someone else for $10,000.  You know you have a backup option with John at that price. By rejecting her offer, you force her to either lower the price or follow through on her bluff."
