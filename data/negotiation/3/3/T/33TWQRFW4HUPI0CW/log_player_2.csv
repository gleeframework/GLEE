"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand $200 might be a little high, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a really great product, and I think you'll get a lot of use out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $90. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about we split the difference and do $110?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $110.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra money."
