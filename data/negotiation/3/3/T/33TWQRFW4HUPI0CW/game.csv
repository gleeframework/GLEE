"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand $200 might be a little high, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? It's a really great product, and I think you'll get a lot of use out of it.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $90. Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about we split the difference and do $110?  That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
