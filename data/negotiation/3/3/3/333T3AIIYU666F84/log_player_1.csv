"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if Bob is serious and how high he's willing to go.  I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's significantly higher than his initial offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I am running out of rounds, I don't want to accept a price so far below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my minimum price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is only a small decrease from my last offer, but it shows Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement. I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to him, as we're getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm getting worried I won't be able to get a price I'm comfortable with. I don't want to risk losing out on any money, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a secure deal and meets my minimum requirement."
