Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know this is a valuable item for you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Focus on shared value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, framing the negotiation as a win-win situation. This can help encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I've left space for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation process. 
* **Prepared for Plan B:**  If negotiations with Bob break down, I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can still sell the product for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $950,000 is still less than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for a better price:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my target, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  With John as a backup buyer, I can afford to be a bit more assertive and try to secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing compromise and value:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. However, it's still above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us. This can appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Encouraging finality:** I'm hinting at closing the deal, creating a sense of urgency to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with my budget and yours.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 matches my minimum desired price.
* **No further gain:** I'm unlikely to get a higher price from Bob, as he's already at his maximum budget.
* **Equal value:**  This offer is a win-win, as it meets both my needs and Bob's.

**Next Steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, securing the best possible price without risking further negotiation."
