"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation.  Alice's first offer is overpriced. We have plenty of room to haggle and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. I'm interested, but could you do better?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This offer is still well above her valuation but leaves us room to go up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we can still do better.  We're getting closer to a price I'd be happy with. Let's see if she'll move a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

I'm inching closer to her last offer while still trying to maintain some bargaining power.  We are getting into a good price range now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is a good price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle at $100? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice is clearly committed to selling, and we've negotiated a price well below my initial limit. It's time to accept and seal the deal."
