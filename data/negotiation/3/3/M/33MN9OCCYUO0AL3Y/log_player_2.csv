"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There are still rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth rejecting the offer and attempting to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his maximum budget but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget.  There are still rounds left, and it's worth continuing to negotiate to try and reach a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at my budget. I'm prepared to pay $8,750.  This is my final offer. Let me know if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing Alice he's serious about making a deal. He's only $250 away from his maximum, but he's also signaling this is his final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, with only 5 rounds left, it's more beneficial for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her rejecting further offers or running out of rounds, leaving Bob with no product.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
