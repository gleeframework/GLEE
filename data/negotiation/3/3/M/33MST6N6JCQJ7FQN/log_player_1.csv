Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice absolutely won't sell for less than $1,000,000 because she has John as a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. This is his ceiling for a reasonable purchase.
* **The Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 (Bob's limit) and $1,000,000 (Alice's minimum).

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high, knowing she has a backup plan. Here's her offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $950,000 sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is likely to stay above her $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some wiggle room for Bob to counter-offer, making him feel more involved in the process.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might want to start even higher to allow for more concessions.
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, Alice might adjust her strategy to be less aggressive.

**In summary, Alice's offer aims to maximize her profit while leaving the door open for a deal with Bob.**"
