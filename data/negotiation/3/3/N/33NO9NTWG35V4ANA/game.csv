"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal, and $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your initial offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit too low for me. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and your budget.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'll make a final counteroffer of $850000 for the product. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, considering the value of the product to me and your initial offer.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and $850000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'll counter with $975000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,7,
