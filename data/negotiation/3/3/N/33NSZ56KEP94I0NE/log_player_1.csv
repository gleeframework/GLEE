{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate. Remember, we don't know Bob's value for the product, so we need to start high to potentially maximize our profit. However, it's still a reasonable offer considering the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  We also express enthusiasm to encourage Bob to engage.  

If Bob rejects this offer, we'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,600,000 is a decent offer, we can still aim for a higher price.  We know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to us, and Bob's offer is within that range.  We will counter with a lower price, but still above our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. We've lowered the price but remain above our minimum. By emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, we aim to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still above my budget.  I'm ready to pay $1700000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a good deal.  It's above our minimum of $1,500,000, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of a stalemate or needing to sell to John for a lower price."
