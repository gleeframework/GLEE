{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds immense value for you.  I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. This price reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your operations.  I'm open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm holding out for something closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000.  I believe the product's value justifies a price closer to $1,100,000.  This price still offers you a strong return on your investment, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price point. It's a fair deal, considering the value the product has for him. It's time to close this deal."
