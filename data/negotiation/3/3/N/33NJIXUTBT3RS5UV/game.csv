"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I am willing to consider offers up to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to recoup at least some of my investment. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
