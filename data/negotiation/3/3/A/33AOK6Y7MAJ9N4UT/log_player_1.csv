I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer of $1,000,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize potential profit:** This offer allows me to potentially earn $500,000 more than John's offer.
* **Test Bob's interest:** This price will give me a good indication of how much Bob values the product. If he's willing to pay a premium, I know the product is likely worth more to him than just its base value. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have room to negotiate down if Bob isn't willing to pay the full amount.  

I'm confident that this offer strikes a good balance between maximizing my profit and giving Bob an incentive to accept."
