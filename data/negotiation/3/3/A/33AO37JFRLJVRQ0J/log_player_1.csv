"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm also trying to be flexible to reach an agreement quickly.  The $9,750 price is a compromise, and hopefully, Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $9,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation.  I believe I have enough time to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your price. Let's try $9,650. That's a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. "", ""product_price"": 9650}
```

I'm offering $9,650, which is just $50 more than Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible but still want to get closer to my desired price.  Hopefully, this offer is enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with a price of $9,550 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation.  I believe I have enough time to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,600. That way we both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm offering $9,600, which is exactly halfway between our last two offers. This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and that I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and am willing to agree on a price of $9,575 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,575. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,575
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only two rounds left, the potential for further negotiation with Bob seems limited. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and ensures a more substantial profit. While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll budge further, and I risk losing both deals."
