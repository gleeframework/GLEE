"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and to be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $15,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, $11,000 is getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm trying to find a price point that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250?  That's my final offer.",12250.0,Alice,7,
