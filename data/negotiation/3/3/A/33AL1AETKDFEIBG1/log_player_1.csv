Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and to be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $15,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're right, $11,000 is getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I'm trying to find a price point that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
