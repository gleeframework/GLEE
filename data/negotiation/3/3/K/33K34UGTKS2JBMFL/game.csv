"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility on price.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1000000, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see your point about the price.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I believe this product holds significantly more value than $1000000.  Let's compromise at $1100000.  This price reflects the unique benefits you'll receive from this product, and it's also a fair deal for me.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
