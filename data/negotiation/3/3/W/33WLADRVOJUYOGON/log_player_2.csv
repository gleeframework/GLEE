"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $11,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However,  $10,500 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $10,500.  Accepting this offer is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice will walk away and he'll be stuck with John's price."
