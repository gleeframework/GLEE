Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, halfway between our previous offers.  Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible but still want to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John.  It seems like Bob is firm on his offer, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing him altogether and ending up with a lower price from John."
