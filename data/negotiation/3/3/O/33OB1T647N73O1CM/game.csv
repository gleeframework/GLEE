"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned the product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above this price. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the value of this product.  While your offer is reasonable, I'm aiming for a price closer to my original asking price. Would you consider $2,100,000?  I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between your original offer and my initial counteroffer? That would put the price at $2,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
