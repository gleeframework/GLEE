"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still quite a stretch for me. Could you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you see the value in this product. $12,000 is still a bit low for what I have in mind.  Would you be willing to go up to $14,500?  I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $14,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $13,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
