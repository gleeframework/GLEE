Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $1,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $950,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle now.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $900,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
