"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? This price still gives you a good deal considering the product's value, and it's closer to my minimum asking price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $12,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you be open to $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. Would you consider $11,500?  This price is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs while still providing you with a valuable product. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable price and finalize the sale.",11500.0,Alice,5,
