Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable for your business.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's a win for me as it's at my floor value. There's no point in risking the deal and getting into a lengthy negotiation process."
