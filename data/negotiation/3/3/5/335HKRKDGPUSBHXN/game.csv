"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
