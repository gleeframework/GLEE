"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind.  I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the $700,000 offer is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the inherent value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer reflects a significant price reduction and demonstrates my desire to make this deal work.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to work towards a deal. How about $900,000?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this done.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to move up on price.  To meet you halfway, let's settle on $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as it significantly discounts the true value while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
