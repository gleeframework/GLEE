"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, which is valued at $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000, a great deal that I think you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer is below your maximum budget, it's still more than you need to spend. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Accept Alice's Offer:** You save $1,000 compared to John, but spend more than its actual worth to Alice.
* **Reject Alice's Offer:** You risk her not coming down further in price.
* **Buy From John:** You pay the absolute maximum you're willing, but you know the deal is done.

Since you want to save as much as possible, the best move is to see if Alice will come down further.
