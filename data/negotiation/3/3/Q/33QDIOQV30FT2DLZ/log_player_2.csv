# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I am offering it to you for $140. This is a special deal considering its worth to you is $100, and I hope you find this offer attractive.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better.  Since you are willing to pay $100, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's room for compromise, and you might be able to get a price closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $140 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110, as this is the highest I can go while still getting a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product and aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am proposing a price of $125 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a fair return for us. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $125 is still a bit high. You're still willing to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to your $100 limit. There's still room to get a better deal, so rejecting Alice's offer and continuing the negotiation makes sense."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $125 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a significant step up from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
