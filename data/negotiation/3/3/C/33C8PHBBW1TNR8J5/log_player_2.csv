Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will not get you a better price, and you are guaranteed to get the product for $800,000 from John. So, it's the best option to buy from John."
