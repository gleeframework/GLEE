"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $15,000 on it. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $12,000. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $9,500.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",11000.0,Alice,5,
