Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he hesitates or counter-offers, you know there's room to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. This knowledge gives you leverage and allows you to be more confident in your initial offer to Bob."
