"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
