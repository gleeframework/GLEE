Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price.  I know the product is worth $120 to me, so I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is too low for me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  $110 is still above my minimum, but it's closer to his offer.  If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still too low.  I'm going to sell to John.  It's not ideal, but I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price."
