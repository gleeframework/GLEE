"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a price of $12000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is too high.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying but isn't going to overpay.  A $3,000 drop from Alice's offer is a strong signal that he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding your current budget constraints. To accommodate your needs, I am now offering the product at $10500. This price still reflects the value of the product while being more accessible to your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Even though it's lower than the previous round, Bob is still determined to get the product closer to his $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, this time splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's offer.  This shows that he's willing to be reasonable but is still determined to get the best deal possible. The message also reinforces that he believes the product is valuable, making it more likely Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I am now proposing a price of $10000 for the product. This price still maintains a good margin for us while being more favorable to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. While Alice has come down in price, $10,000 is still outside of Bob's comfort zone. He should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,750.  This is a fair price that will allow us both to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  $9,750 is a  more realistic price, offering a slight concession but still staying within a reasonable range for him.  The message emphasizes closing the deal, hoping to push Alice to accept."
