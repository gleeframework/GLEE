"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to give you a discount for being a valued customer.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into preparing it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify going over $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $12,000 to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
