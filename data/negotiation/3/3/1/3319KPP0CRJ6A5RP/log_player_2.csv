Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,500. Would you consider $12,875? This feels like a reasonable compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12875}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing his strategy of gradual negotiation, aiming to inch closer to his target price. This counteroffer is a smaller step down from Alice's latest offer, making it more likely she'll accept. It also shows Bob's flexibility and willingness to compromise, which can be persuasive in negotiations."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,875. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $12,900. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,900 is just $900 above Bob's target price of $12,000. This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting, considering:

* **Time:** There are only a few rounds left.  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate will lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away.
* **Potential Gain:** Bob is still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.
* **Compromise:** Alice has shown willingness to compromise, indicating a potential for a final agreement.

It's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that is still favorable to him."
