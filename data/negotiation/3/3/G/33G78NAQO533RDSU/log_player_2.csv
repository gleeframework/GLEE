"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a significant return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($800,000).  There's a good chance we can negotiate a much better price by making a counteroffer.  While John offers a safe fallback at $1,500,000, it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Splitting the Difference:** Our counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's initial offer ($1,200,000) and her known valuation ($800,000). This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,000,000 is our target, we've left some space for further negotiation. Alice might counter, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her $800,000 valuation.
* **Pressure from John's Offer:**  We haven't mentioned John's offer directly, but it implicitly sets a ceiling on what we're willing to pay. If negotiations with Alice stall significantly above $1,500,000, we always have that option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting the significant value this product brings.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but we're still a good bit above her valuation. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can get a better deal.  We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($50,000) to signal that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We've added language like ""ready to close the deal"" to subtly create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to agree. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  We're still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's initial offer while acknowledging the potential risk that she might walk away. We have John as a backup, but every counteroffer is a gamble."
