"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about the value you place on the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $850,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product and allows us both to make a good deal.  I hope you'll consider this offer seriously."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget.  It's a significant step down from Alice's latest offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation. This move demonstrates your commitment to the deal while also pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but it's the highest I can go at this time.  I'm hoping you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still working towards your desired price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  I'm willing to come up to $915,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong desire to finalize this deal. I'm hoping you'll consider this my final offer and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to your desired target.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to come up to $915,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $918,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $918,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your desired price point of $800,000, and you only have one round left to negotiate.  Given the limited time remaining, and the fact that you've already made multiple concessions, it's unlikely Alice will come down further to your desired price.  To avoid risking losing the opportunity to purchase the product altogether, it's best to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
