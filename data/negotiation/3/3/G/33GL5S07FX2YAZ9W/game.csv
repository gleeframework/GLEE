"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for my comfort. Considering the product's value and the market conditions, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. I'm confident that this price is still a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob, but $950000 is getting closer to my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need you to meet me at a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
