"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to get at least $875,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle on this one.",875000.0,Alice,3,
