"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still above his budget.  He should counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to get at least $875,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle on this one. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, $875,000 is within his budget and getting closer to his desired price.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much lower, and he risks losing the product entirely if he rejects the offer."
