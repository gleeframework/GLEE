Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already gone lower than my initial offer, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.

Alice has gone down to her minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well below John's offer.  It's time to take the deal."
