"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. However, $12,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
