""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $850,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my original price. How about we settle at $925,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe with a few more rounds, we can reach a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $880,000 for the product. This is a very fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $880,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price."
