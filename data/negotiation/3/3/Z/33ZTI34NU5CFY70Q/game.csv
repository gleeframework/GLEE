"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $17,000 is still a little high for my budget though.  How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. I could be persuaded to go down to $15,000, but that's my absolute lowest price.",15000.0,Alice,5,
