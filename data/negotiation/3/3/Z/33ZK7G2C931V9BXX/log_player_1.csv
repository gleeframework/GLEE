Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** I'm aiming for more than my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  This leaves room for negotiation and ensures he's still getting a good deal.
* **It shows confidence:**  By not starting too low, I demonstrate that I believe the product is worth a significant amount.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm raising the price a bit from Bob's offer. This is still a good deal for him, as he's willing to pay $1,500,000.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum.  It's also more than John is offering, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
