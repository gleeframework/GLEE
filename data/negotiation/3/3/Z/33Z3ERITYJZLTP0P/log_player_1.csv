"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly approach can encourage Bob to engage and be more willing to negotiate. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, which could make him more inclined to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's closer, I'm not willing to sell for less than $9,000 right now. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** With 8 rounds left, I can try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a backup.** I have a guaranteed sale for $10,000, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from my desired price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,150?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Focusing on finding common ground:** I'm emphasizing the goal of finding a price that works for both of us, which could make Bob more inclined to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum.**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,500, $9,000 is within my acceptable range.
* **Time is running out.** We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If I don't accept Bob's offer, I can always sell to John for $10,000. However, taking Bob's offer now ensures I don't miss out on a sale altogether."
