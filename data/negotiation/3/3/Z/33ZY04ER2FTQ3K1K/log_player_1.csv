"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($15,000) as my minimum is $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm providing a reason for the price to make it seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question to invite Bob to counter-offer. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. Starting high allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $15000. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm willing to accept something closer to $14,000.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John right now would mean I'm losing out on potential profit.

**Strategy:** 

I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and try to bring him up to a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $14,000, which is a compromise that gives me more profit than his offer.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by mentioning it's a ""significant reduction"" from my original offer. This makes it seem like I'm being flexible.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending with a question to invite Bob to respond and potentially negotiate further. 

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and increase the likelihood of him accepting my offer. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offering while avoiding selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Bob has increased his offer significantly from his initial $12,500. We're now very close to my ideal range. 
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll offer more in the next round. I could end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're only on Round 4, and I want to close the deal before I run out of time.

**Strategy:**

This is a good deal for me considering the time pressure and the possibility of getting a lower price from John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer to ensure a sale and secure a decent profit."
