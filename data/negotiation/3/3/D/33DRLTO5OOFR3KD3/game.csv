"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and the returns it can generate. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation while still providing you with a great deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and potential returns.",825000.0,Bob,4,
