Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're guaranteed a profit of $2,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** You're not just throwing out a random number, you're stating your desired price and giving Bob a reason why it's fair. 

This strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is a decent amount, it's still below your ideal price and you know Bob is willing to pay more.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round. You have leverage because you know Bob values the product at $12,000, and he clearly wants it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $9,000, which is closer to your desired price and still a good deal for him.  Accepting this offer gives you a profit of $1,000, which is a reasonable outcome considering the negotiations.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get much higher, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you keep pushing."
