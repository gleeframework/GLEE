"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you seeing the value in this product. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done. I think this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussion.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can finalize this deal.",860000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your latest offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $880,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to make one final concession to get the deal done. I think this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussion.",880000.0,Alice,7,
