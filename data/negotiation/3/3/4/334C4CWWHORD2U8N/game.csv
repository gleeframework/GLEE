"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're trying to get the best deal.  $10,800 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I can't go any lower than $10,900. This is my final offer.",10900.0,Alice,5,
