"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $6,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. If that's still not acceptable, I'd be happy to discuss further.",8000.0,Alice,3,
