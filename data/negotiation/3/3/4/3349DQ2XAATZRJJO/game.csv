"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
