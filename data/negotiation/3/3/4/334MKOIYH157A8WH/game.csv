"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $7,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, how about $8,000? That's my absolute minimum price, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to the original price. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $7,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible.",7000.0,Bob,6,
