"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time opportunity to get a great deal on a truly unique item.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've already made a serious offer of $1050000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1150000, which would be $1100000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made it clear that $1050000 is my maximum budget, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd like to reiterate that offer one last time. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at that price?",1050000.0,Bob,8,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000, and I've already met you halfway in previous offers. I'm not willing to make another concession. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I'll meet you at $1075000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
