"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $900000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a little further and offer you the product for $1000000. This reflects the value I believe this product holds for you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
