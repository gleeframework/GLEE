"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You can still save money by negotiating further.
* **John's price is your upper limit.** You can't afford to pay more than $1,500,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price.**"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price.** You want to pay closer to $1,200,000.
* **John's price is still your upper limit, but you have room to negotiate further.**  
* **Rejecting Alice's offer gives you another chance to negotiate a lower price.** You're in a strong position, as Alice already lowered her offer."
