Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,550,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the market, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This represents a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. It demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product while remaining within my financial constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 quickly. John offers a guaranteed sale at that price, making it the most strategically sound option at this point. It avoids further negotiation and the risk of Bob not meeting our valuation."
