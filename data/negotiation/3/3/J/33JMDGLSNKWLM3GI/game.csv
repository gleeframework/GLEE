"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,550,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the market, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This represents a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is too far from my current position. I'm willing to be flexible, but this product holds significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This considers both our interests.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. It demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product while remaining within my financial constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
