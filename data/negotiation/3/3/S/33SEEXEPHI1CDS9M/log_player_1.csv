"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable in the right hands. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer significantly above both our valuations. This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for me to make concessions while still aiming for a price well above $1,000,000.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's unique value and future potential, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling my willingness to negotiate. 
 
It's important to remember I have the John backup offer, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask.  I believe there's room for him to go higher, especially since he expressed a strong interest in the product. Rejecting this offer shows I'm serious about obtaining a price closer to my target. I'm willing to negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your proposal. While I understand your budgetary considerations, the value of this product goes beyond the $1,500,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective and offer to meet him ""halfway,"" fostering a sense of collaboration.
* **Strategic Concession:** While I come down from my initial offer, I'm still aiming high ($1,650,000) to maximize my profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I reiterate the product's inherent value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake. 

By taking this approach, I aim to keep the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your offer careful consideration, Alice. While I respect the value you see in the product, I must stick to my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but he's also sticking to a budget around $1,600,000.  Accepting this offer gives me a $600,000 profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away or further dragging out the negotiation. 

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, it's not worth jeopardizing the deal at this point.  $1,600,000 is a strong return."
