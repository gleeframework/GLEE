"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $85, which is $87.50. This is a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring to you. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $83.  This is a fair price that reflects my budget and the value I see in this product.",83.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $83 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $83, which is $85.25. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",85.25,Alice,5,
