"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's too early to give up on negotiating with Alice, so I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $18,000 is still too far off from what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $13,000? That's my final offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still $3,000 higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
