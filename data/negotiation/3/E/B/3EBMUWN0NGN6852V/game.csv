"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  I think this is a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal on the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to the price I was thinking of, so I'll make a new offer of $1,280,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle this time.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $1,280,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about we settle on $1,315,000? This price is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?",1315000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,315,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
