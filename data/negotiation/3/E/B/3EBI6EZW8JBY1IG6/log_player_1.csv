Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are willing to be flexible.

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,000,000 is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.  It also leaves the door open for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Congratulations! You've made a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  Be prepared to negotiate further.  If Bob counters with a low offer, you can always reject it and make a counteroffer of your own.  Remember, you have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than your minimum valuation of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for you. While you are open to negotiation, this offer is too far off from your desired price point. 

**Next Steps:**

You will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. This will allow you to explore a compromise while still protecting your interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time.  However, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $800,000 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than your original offer. This shows you are willing to negotiate but also emphasizes your product's value.
* **Message:**  The message is still friendly but firm. It reiterates your minimum price while showing your willingness to compromise. It also frames the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! You've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** Be prepared to negotiate further. You can either lower your counteroffer slightly or consider selling to John if Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low."
