"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time.  However, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
