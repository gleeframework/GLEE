"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and counteroffering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I like the product, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still better than buying from John for $12,000. While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his next counteroffer and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and avoid further risk."
