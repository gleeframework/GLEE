"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my maximum spending limit and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the value you see in it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident that $900,000 is a fair price for both of us. This allows me to stay within my budget and still shows a significant profit for you. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your budget. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that balances my minimum requirement with your maximum budget.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  If this isn't acceptable to you, I'm prepared to buy the product from John for $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,6,
