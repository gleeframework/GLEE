"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly a game-changer and I believe it's worth more than its value to you. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I propose a price of $15000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob's counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of possibility. 
* **Focus on value:**  Bob emphasizes his budget and his perceived value of the product to justify his offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends by inviting Alice to counter, leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counterproposal. Considering the value of the product and your interest in it, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $12000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so Bob can likely secure a better price with another counteroffer.
* **John is a safety net:** Bob knows he can always purchase from John for $10,000, so he can take a more aggressive approach with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm firm at $9,500 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value I see in it and my available funds. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Bob raises his offer slightly to show he is willing to negotiate, but keeps it below his $10,000 limit.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Bob reasserts his perception of the product's value and his financial constraints to justify his offer.
* **Call to action:** He ends with a direct statement encouraging Alice to accept the offer and close the deal."
