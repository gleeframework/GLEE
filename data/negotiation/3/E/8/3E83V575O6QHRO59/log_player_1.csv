{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($800,000) but also gives Bob a good deal, as it's lower than his estimated value ($1,000,000). 
* **The message:** It's friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value proposition for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** Aim for a price close to Bob's perceived value to maximize my profits.
* **Be flexible:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I have a clear floor price ($800,000) and a Plan B (selling to John).
* **Be patient:** I'll let Bob make the first counter-offer, giving me time to analyze his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm also looking to save as much money as I can. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $875,000. I'd like to make one final offer: $875,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer is close to my floor price:** While it's not ideal, it's only $75,000 below my initial goal of $950,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $800,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation has been going on for a while, and it's in my best interest to secure a sale rather than risk further delays.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's final offer is the most logical decision in this situation. It ensures a sale and a reasonable profit, minimizing the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for a lower price from John."
