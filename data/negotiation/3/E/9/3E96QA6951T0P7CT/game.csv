"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $14,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Could you consider $11,000?  That would be a great price for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,000. How about we try $12,500? I think it's a fair price that's closer to my minimum price of $15,000",12500.0,Alice,5,
