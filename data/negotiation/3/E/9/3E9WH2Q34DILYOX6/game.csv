"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it gives you a healthy profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $820,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay $760,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counter with $800,000. This is a fair price for the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
