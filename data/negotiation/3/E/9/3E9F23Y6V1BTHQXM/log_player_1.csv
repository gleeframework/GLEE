Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for that price if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I want to keep the pressure on to see if he'll come up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go that far down in price, and it's clear we're not going to get to a mutually agreeable point.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
