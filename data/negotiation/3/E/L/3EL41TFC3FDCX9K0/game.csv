"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you first. I'm valuing it at $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
