Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

It's getting late in the negotiations and Bob seems unwilling to budge.  While I could continue, I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold of $100.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's a guaranteed sale and I don't want to risk losing any more time or money by continuing the negotiations."
