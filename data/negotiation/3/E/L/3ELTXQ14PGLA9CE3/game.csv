"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and lowered the price from $1500000 to $1350000, and now you're asking me to go down another $150000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $1300000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
