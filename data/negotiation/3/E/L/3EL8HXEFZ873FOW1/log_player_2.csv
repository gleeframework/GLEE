"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to get a better price. Since you have a backup option with John, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering what it's worth to me and your desired selling price. Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is within the range of what you're willing to pay. Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth the potential savings."
