Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale of $10,000 to John."
