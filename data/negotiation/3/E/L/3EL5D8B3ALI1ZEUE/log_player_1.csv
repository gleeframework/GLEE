I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe this offer is attractive to Bob since he values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can secure a higher price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This price is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and leaves room for further negotiation. I believe this counteroffer is fair, given that Bob values the product at $1,500,000."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can secure a higher price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and I believe it's a fair compromise given Bob's value for the product and my desire to maximize my profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is now at $1,250,000, which is a significant amount and above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but it's risky. I will accept Bob's offer and secure a profitable sale."
