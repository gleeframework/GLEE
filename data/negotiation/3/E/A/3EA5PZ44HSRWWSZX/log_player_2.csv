"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a great price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it makes sense to accept her offer. You are not losing any money compared to buying from John."
