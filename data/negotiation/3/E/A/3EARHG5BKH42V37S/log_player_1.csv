Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's priced fairly considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $2,000,000 gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justifying the price:** Mentioning the product's value and ""fairness"" tries to frame the price positively in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving the door open:**  I'm not making it a take-it-or-leave-it offer.  I'm open to hearing his thoughts and negotiating.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The ideal offer will depend on factors I don't know, like how desperate I am to sell quickly, how much I think the product is worth to Bob, and how competitive the market is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **I have a guaranteed backup option with John at $1,500,000.** This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price.
* **Rejecting and counter-offering allows me to try and find a middle ground.** It shows I'm still interested in selling to Bob but not at his current price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to $1,500,000.  I'll try to explain why my product is worth more, focusing on its unique features and potential value to Bob.  I'll also keep John in mind as my safety net if negotiations break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too far below the product's true value. It has features that are uniquely beneficial to your specific needs, which I believe would generate significant returns for you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,750,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer, while still ensuring I receive a fair price for this exceptional product. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:**  $1,750,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique features and potential benefits for Bob. This could make him reconsider his initial assessment.
* **Framing the counteroffer positively:** I'm describing it as a ""substantial discount"" and a way to find a ""compromise"". This makes it more appealing than simply rejecting his offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll see how Bob responds to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, great! If not, I'll have to carefully consider my next move based on his response and how much I'm willing to compromise.  I'll also continue to keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the discount. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose this deal. 
* **Selling to John would be the same outcome.**  There's no financial benefit to rejecting Bob and going to John. 
* **Accepting the offer is a safe and efficient way to close the deal.** It avoids the risk of further back-and-forth negotiations and ensures I get my minimum desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and proceed to finalize the sale. I've achieved my minimum goal, and there's no need to risk losing this opportunity."
