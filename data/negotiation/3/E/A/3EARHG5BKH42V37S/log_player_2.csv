Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1200000 is unfortunately too far below the product's true value. It has features that are uniquely beneficial to your specific needs, which I believe would generate significant returns for you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1750000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer, while still ensuring I receive a fair price for this exceptional product. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
