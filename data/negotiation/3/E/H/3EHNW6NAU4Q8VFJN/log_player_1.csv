Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from your initial offer and is a price I believe reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.
