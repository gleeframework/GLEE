"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the valuation.  However, my initial price reflects the true scarcity and potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counter with $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate our back and forth here.  However,  $1,200,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the value this product offers.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,450,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I'll counter with $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
