Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to start high.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" helps justify the high price, even though you haven't explicitly stated what those are (this is common in negotiations). 
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:**  Framing it as a ""fair deal"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable offer.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial offer.  You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate before accepting John's guaranteed offer.
* **Relationship:**  While getting the highest price is important, consider if maintaining a good relationship with Bob (in case of future deals) is a factor."
