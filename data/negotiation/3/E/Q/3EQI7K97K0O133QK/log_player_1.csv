"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets a strong starting point for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired value, while still leaving room for some negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price range.  I have 8 rounds left, and selling to John is always an option if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a firm position. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can secure a better deal.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm trying to keep it as high as possible. I'm feeling optimistic that I can get a deal closer to my desired price.  We're getting closer, and I'm hoping Bob will see that.  I have five rounds left, so I'm not rushing into any decisions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have 4 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to make a final attempt to push Bob towards my price. This offer is still above my minimum but closer to his last one. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price too far below my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are down to the wire and it's clear that Bob is not going to come close to my minimum acceptable price. I've made every effort to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my value. With only two rounds left, I'm confident I can get my desired price from John."
