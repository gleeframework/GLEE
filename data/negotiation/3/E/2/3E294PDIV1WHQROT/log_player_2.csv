"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $11,500, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is below her perceived value, it's still higher than what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's lower price to potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice or proceed to buy from John at the more favorable price."
