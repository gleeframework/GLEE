Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to him.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $12,000.

**Strategy**

You hold a strong position. You have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price.  Therefore, you should aim high with Bob, leaving room for negotiation but ensuring you don't go below your minimum.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the product. Given its unique value and the high demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $14,500. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** The $14,500 starting point aims to maximize your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""high demand"" creates perceived scarcity and justifies the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone encourages Bob to counter-offer, leaving space for a deal that's still profitable for you.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer, but never below $12,000.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive starting point might be beneficial.

**Remember:**  You have the power in this negotiation! Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that's agreeable to you. John's offer ensures you won't lose out."
