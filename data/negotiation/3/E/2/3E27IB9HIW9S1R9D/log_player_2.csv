Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $1400000 is simply too low for me. It's essential that I get at least $1600000 for this product.  This price still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going.
