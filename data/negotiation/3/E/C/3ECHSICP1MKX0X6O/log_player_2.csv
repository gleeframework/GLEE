"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $995,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $995,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum budget and also less than John's offer of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer saves you money compared to both your alternative and John's price."
