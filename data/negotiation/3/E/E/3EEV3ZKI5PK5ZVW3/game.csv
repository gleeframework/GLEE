"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
