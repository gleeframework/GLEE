"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get more than my minimum desired price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $145 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and still above my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $155 is a good price, above my minimum and it seems like he's not going to go higher.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $150."
