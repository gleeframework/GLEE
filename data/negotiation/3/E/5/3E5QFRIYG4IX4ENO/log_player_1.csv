Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a high price, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Expressing Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to me, but I'm still offering it for a lower price than what it's worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts. 

**Strategy:** 

This initial offer is a balance between maximizing my potential profit and keeping the negotiation open. By starting high, I can potentially get a higher price, but if Bob isn't interested at this price, I can negotiate downwards without losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering the minimum amount I'm willing to accept.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** Since Bob is willing to negotiate, I believe there's still room to get a better price.  
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $10,000 is safe, I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get a higher offer from Bob.

**Next Step:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer. This will signal that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm happy to consider a lower price, but $10,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer.
* **Middle Ground:** The price of $12,500 represents a reasonable compromise, which could make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that I'm still considering a price that's above my minimum value. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair deal for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our initial positions. It's a strategic move to show flexibility and encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to get closer to $12,500 in the future. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $10,000 would be a guaranteed profit, but the risk of continuing negotiations could lead to a higher price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and there's a possibility of further negotiation in the future.  I'm taking the opportunity cost into account and deciding that the potential for a slightly higher price with Bob outweighs the guarantee of selling to John for $10,000."
