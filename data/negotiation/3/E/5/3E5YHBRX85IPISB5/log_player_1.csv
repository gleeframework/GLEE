Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm not quite ready to commit at that price.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
