"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the value of the product to make it more appealing.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and keep track of the rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it's still above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  
* **Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain a higher selling point and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer to Bob in the next round, taking into account his willingness to negotiate and the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasizing the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and suggesting that a price closer to my initial asking price reflects that value. 
* **Urgency:** I'm mentioning the importance of finalizing the deal to create a sense of urgency. 

**Next Steps:** I will closely observe Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. The remaining rounds and my minimum value will be key factors in my decision-making."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $1700000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While Bob is proposing a ""middle ground,"" this offer is lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling for a lower price than I could potentially get from John. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I still have rounds left and I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob, or at least secure my minimum value.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the remaining rounds, my minimum acceptable value, and Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'll also consider the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and needing to rely on John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,600,000.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's keep talking, and see if we can bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Standing firm on minimum:**  I'm firmly stating my minimum acceptable price of $1,600,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about my value.
* **Emphasizing value again:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my stance and keep the focus on its worth.
* **Staying positive:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone, encouraging further negotiation rather than shutting down the conversation. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll need to monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on the remaining rounds. I'm getting closer to my minimum and need to carefully consider my options to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. $1550000 is my next offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum value of $1,500,000, it's very close.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  With only four rounds remaining, there's a significant risk that Bob might become less willing to negotiate or that I won't be able to reach a better deal with him.
* **Guarantee a profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, although it's only slightly above my minimum.

**Next Steps:**  While it would have been ideal to reach my desired price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of losing a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's a pragmatic decision given the limited negotiation time remaining."
