Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) than to Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation but also shows my firm stance.
* **Room for compromise:**  A $1,000 difference allows for a potential compromise during negotiation. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** Knowing I have a backup offer of $15,000 from John keeps me from accepting a price lower than $14,000 without considering the potential for Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum:**  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $15,000 minimum. 
* **Potential for a better offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push him to increase his offer closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer provides security:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 gives me the safety net of a guaranteed sale if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. If he accepts, I secure a good deal. If he rejects, I can either make another counteroffer or fall back on John's offer.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  As always, having John's offer provides the security of knowing I can secure a better price elsewhere if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $13,000 offer, and I've already made a compromise by offering $13,500. It seems unlikely he'll budge further.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  At this point, selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me the maximum profit. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and ultimately ending up with a worse deal than John's.

It's time to take the sure thing and move on."
