"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $7,000 is too low for me to consider.  I could meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price.  However, I need to get at least $8,000 for this product. I'm willing to come down to $8,200, but that's my final offer.",8200.0,Alice,5,
