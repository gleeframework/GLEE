"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer. The goal is to save as much money as possible, and a counteroffer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  A counteroffer of $950,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a bold move, but it puts pressure on Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not the ideal price, it's only $50,000 more than what Bob can get from John. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product without risking further negotiation and potential delays."
