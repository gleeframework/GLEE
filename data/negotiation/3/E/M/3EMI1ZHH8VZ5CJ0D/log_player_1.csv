Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 

By offering a price lower than my minimum acceptable price but still higher than Bob's perceived value, I maximize my chances of getting a good deal while still having a backup option with John."
