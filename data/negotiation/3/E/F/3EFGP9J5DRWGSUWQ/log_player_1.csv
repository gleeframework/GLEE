Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000)  gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $11,500 price is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000, so I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message makes the negotiation more amicable and increases the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer at my minimum price, giving me leverage if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum threshold of $12,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further might take time and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or me getting a lower price from John.  

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my $12,000 goal, accepting this offer is a practical and time-efficient decision."
