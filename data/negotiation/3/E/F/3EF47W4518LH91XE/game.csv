"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Based on its market value and potential benefits to your business, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value a quick and smooth transaction, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's substantial value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be open to $950,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
