Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures that you're still making a profit even if Bob accepts the initial offer.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows the negotiation to play out and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.

I've also included a friendly message to make the initial interaction more positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  I need to make at least $1,500,000 to meet my needs. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Although Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John is a backup option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John and get my desired price. 

This strategy allows me to explore potential middle ground with Bob while ensuring I have a safe alternative if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a profit margin:**  $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to my desired minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Encouraging further discussion:** The message emphasizes finding a solution that benefits both parties, encouraging Bob to consider a counteroffer or further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to create a path to a successful deal while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the market value. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant financial loss.
* **John is still a viable option:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 would secure my desired price, providing a safe and profitable alternative.
* **Opportunity for a final counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make one final counteroffer. This might push Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value, or it might lead to a decision to sell to John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my leverage in the negotiation and potentially secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to go a little further and offer the product for $1,375,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my part, and it's a price I believe is fair considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer, signaling to Bob that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Small compromise:**  This price is still slightly below my desired minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise and potentially seal the deal.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** The message highlights the compromise and reinforces the perceived value of the product, making it more appealing to Bob.

By presenting a final offer and emphasizing the compromise, I aim to encourage Bob to accept and secure a price that is closer to my minimum value.  If Bob rejects, I will proceed with selling the product to John, as his offer remains my guaranteed profit."
