Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could sell to John for $150, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is slightly below John's price, making it more enticing for Bob. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" can encourage Bob to act quickly.

This approach balances getting the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
