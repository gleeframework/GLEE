Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum) represent the potential negotiation space.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start confidently, emphasizing the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""returns"" subtly suggests Bob will recoup the investment, making the price more palatable.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but never below $1,200,000).
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're on a tight deadline, you might need to be more flexible. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy ready!"
