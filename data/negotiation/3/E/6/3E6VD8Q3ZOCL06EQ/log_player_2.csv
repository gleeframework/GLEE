"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $140. While this is cheaper than John's offer, you can still do better.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate further with her or find another seller who might offer a lower price."
