"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $900,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 represents a fair valuation, I'm willing to come down slightly.  Would you consider $1,025,000?  This allows me to make some concessions while still reflecting the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $962,500? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's land this. How about $995,000? This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial deal.",995000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $995,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This feels like a fair price considering our previous discussions, and I believe this is the final offer I can make.",975000.0,Bob,6,
