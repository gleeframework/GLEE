"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation.  It leaves room to increase your offer while still aiming for a price well below your $8,000 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. Her response will give you valuable information for the remaining rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be willing to go up to $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved from her initial offer, $9,000 is still more than your $8,000 budget and what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential to reach a more favorable price. You have time to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** This counter-offer shows you're willing to negotiate by increasing your offer significantly from $6,000. 
* **Staying Below Budget:** The $7,000 offer keeps you under your maximum budget while still leaving some wiggle room for a potential final compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help you gauge how much lower Alice is willing to go. It's a good next step in the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $8,500. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'd agree once you have it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Above Budget:** Alice is getting closer, but $8,500 is still $500 more than John's offer. 
* **Pressure Tactic:**  Alice's message tries to create a sense of urgency and value, but you have a viable alternative with John.
* **Potential for Compromise:** You still have rounds left to negotiate and potentially get Alice closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, and I am serious about buying it. However, my budget is firm at $8,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You are putting your best offer on the table, matching John's price.
* **Firm but Fair:** Your message is polite but firm, indicating you're not willing to go any higher. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning your ""other options,"" you subtly remind Alice that you could walk away and buy from John. 
* **Clean Resolution:**  This offer gives Alice a clear choice â€“ accept a reasonable price or potentially lose the sale."
