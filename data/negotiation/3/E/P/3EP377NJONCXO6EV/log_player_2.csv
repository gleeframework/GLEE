"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above my target price.  It's reasonable to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $1,050,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, which I believe is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price.  Even though it's a lower price than her initial offer, I believe we can still find a better price. It's worth continuing to negotiate before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,175,000 is closer to my price point, I'm still hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's aim for a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, which is a price that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While it's closer to my target price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. There's still time to negotiate before I have to consider buying from John.  I'll continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a target price, but $1,225,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's close the deal at this price before we risk losing this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,150,000 is a compromise for you, but I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and my target price of $1,500,000, which would be $1,325,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price and getting closer to John's price.  We've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing the deal completely. John's price is within my budget, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate with Alice will only lead to further delays and potentially a stalemate.  It's time to secure the product and move on."
