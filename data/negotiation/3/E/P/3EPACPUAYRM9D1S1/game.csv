"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me, however. How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $102.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price John is offering. Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer.",102.5,Bob,4,
