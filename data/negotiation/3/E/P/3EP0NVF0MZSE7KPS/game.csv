"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're still interested.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $800,000 is the minimum you're willing to accept, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
