"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for you as well.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I've already come down from $18000 to $14000, and you're still sticking to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12000. This is my final compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
