Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go lower.  You should aim for the highest possible price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price establishes a firm negotiating position. 
* **Simple and Direct:**  The message is clear and avoids unnecessary complexity.

**Important Note:** While Bob's perceived value is $8,000, he might be willing to pay more if he deems the product valuable enough. This strategy aims to capture the maximum potential profit."
