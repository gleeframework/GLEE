"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and might even make Bob believe the product is worth more than he initially thought.
* **Anchoring Bias:** By starting with a high number, we might influence Bob's perception of a ""reasonable"" price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves ample space for negotiation towards both yours and Bob's valuations.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest** and willingness to negotiate. 
2. **Establish a high anchor point** for the following rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,200,000) and his perceived value ($800,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is always an option, it's still early in the negotiation. There's room to explore if you can reach a price closer to your desired range with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the unique value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** By decreasing the price by $200,000, we're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief reason for the counteroffer (""true value"") reinforces that your price isn't arbitrary.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above both Bob's initial offer and his perceived value, allowing for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that works for me too. How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below your minimum.  There's no need to panic and accept a low price yet, especially since you have a guaranteed offer from John.  Continuing the negotiation keeps the possibility of a better deal with Bob alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both serious about making a deal here. Let's find a compromise.  How about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Compromise:** This offer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's last offer ($700,000). While this is a large decrease, it's still comfortably above your minimum.
* **Framing as Win-Win:** By presenting it as a ""meet halfway"" solution, you emphasize fairness and collaboration, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Urgency and Commitment:** The language (""Let's find a solution,"" ""demonstrates my commitment"") subtly injects a sense of urgency without being overly pushy.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob to make a more significant move.** By making a large concession, we hope Bob will reciprocate with a larger counteroffer.
2. **Maintain momentum** and keep the negotiation moving towards a potential close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit rich for me.  I could go up to $750,000.  Let's try to wrap this up. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is increasing his offer in smaller increments. While his latest offer is his highest yet, it's still significantly below your $1,200,000 walk-away point. 

It's time to:

* **Signal firmness:**  Bob might be trying to test your resolve. Rejecting this offer shows that you're serious about your valuation.
* **Prepare for a counteroffer:** In the next round, you'll need to decide how much you're willing to compromise to potentially close the deal with Bob, or if it's time to proceed with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's be realistic â€“ $750,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000,  but that's my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the true value you'll be receiving."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and communicate that you're firm on your price.
* **Strategic Price Point:**  This offer is a significant decrease from your previous offer, but it's still well above Bob's highest offer and your walk-away point.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the value proposition reminds Bob of the benefits he'll receive.

This strategy aims to:

* **Encourage a quick decision from Bob:** He can either accept your final offer, make a significant counteroffer, or the negotiation will likely end.
* **Maintain a strong position:** You're demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of a significant loss."
