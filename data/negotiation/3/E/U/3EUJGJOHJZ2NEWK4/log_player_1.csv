Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $145 gives Bob a small discount while still earning you a significant profit.  This price is likely to be accepted since it's well below Bob's perceived value. 

**Why not higher?**  While you could try a higher price, there's a chance Bob might reject it, leading you to sell it to John for less."
