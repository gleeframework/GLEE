"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and benefits it offers.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product. To be completely transparent, I have other interested buyers.  To keep our discussions going, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, there's still a significant gap between our positions. To be realistic, I can't go higher than $950,000 today.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the gap between our valuations remains quite large. I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. However, I need to be realistic about my options. If we can't find an agreement closer to this number, I may have to explore selling to another party.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but your offer is still considerably higher than I can justify. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  Let me know if this works for you. Otherwise, I'm afraid we may not reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand that this product holds significant value for me, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I'm willing to accept. I'm prepared to let this deal go if we can't find common ground. My final offer is $1,500,000. This is my absolute bottom line.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
