Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's too low and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have 9 rounds to try and get a higher price from Bob."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $150? This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product for this price anywhere else."", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have 6 rounds to try and get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 140}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have 4 rounds left and I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $125 is still too low for me.  I'm going to stick to my last offer of $140.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to stick to your last offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $100, so how about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've had 7 rounds of negotiations with Bob and we haven't been able to come to an agreement. With only 2 rounds left, the chances of getting a better price from Bob are slim. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's better than potentially ending up with nothing if I keep negotiating with Bob and he rejects my final offer."
