"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm really looking to stay under $8000. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about $9000? It's a fair price for both of us and lets me stay within my spending limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. This is a great deal for both of us, and it lets me stay within my own financial needs.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is still just a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9000.  If that doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
