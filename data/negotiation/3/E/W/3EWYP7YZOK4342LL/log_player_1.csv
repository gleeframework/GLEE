Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a fair compromise between my minimum price of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $120.  I believe there's room for negotiation, so I'm not aiming for the highest price immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's counteroffer of $90 is a good deal.  It's above my minimum price of $80 and likely closer to what I can realistically expect to get.  I'd rather accept this offer than risk a longer negotiation or ending up selling to John for $80."
