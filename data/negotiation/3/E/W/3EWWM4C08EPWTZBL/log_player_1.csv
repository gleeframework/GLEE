Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $120 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start by aiming higher.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than $120.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting value for Bob without being overly aggressive. 
 
**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, with the information at hand, aiming higher initially gives me the best chance to maximize my profit."
