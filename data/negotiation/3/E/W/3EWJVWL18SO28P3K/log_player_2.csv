Round 2

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle on $95? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

I'm nudging the price closer to my target while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $102. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. At $102, the price is reasonable and saves me a decent amount compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
