"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $1100000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your interest,  $1100000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1125000.  This price still allows for a mutually beneficial outcome, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
