Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm confident it's still a profitable deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's the most I can realistically afford. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firm on his $12,000 offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum price. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
