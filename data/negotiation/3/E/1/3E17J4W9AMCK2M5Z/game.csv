"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $20,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned, and I'm confident it's still a profitable deal for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's the most I can realistically afford. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,4,
