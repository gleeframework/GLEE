,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than $110. How about we meet at $125? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really like the product!",125.0,Alice,3,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $121. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $118 and $121, so how about $120? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",120.0,Bob,8,
