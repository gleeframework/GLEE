"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at that price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
