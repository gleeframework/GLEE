Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a price that gives me some room to negotiate but is also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While $9,000 is better than $8,000, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and potentially ending up with a lower price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
