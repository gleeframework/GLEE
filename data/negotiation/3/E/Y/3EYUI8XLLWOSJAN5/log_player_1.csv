Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the market price, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
