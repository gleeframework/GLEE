"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the market price, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $1,100,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the long-term benefits it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,250,000. This would allow me to secure the product while staying within my financial limits. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
