"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than Alice's minimum desired price of $800,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. This counteroffer is a starting point that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum desired price. This makes the counteroffer reasonable and provides room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and it's closer to John's price of $1,000,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's still room to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  His previous offer of $850,000 was rejected, so he's increasing his offer slightly to $875,000. This is still significantly less than Alice's latest offer of $925,000 but shows that Bob is willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer allows for further discussion and potentially leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting progressively higher, and her latest offer of $950,000 is dangerously close to John's price of $1,000,000.  While it's still possible to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of getting stuck at a price very close to John's is too high. It's more prudent to cut the negotiation short and purchase the product from John."
