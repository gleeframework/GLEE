(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to come down a bit.  If she's willing to negotiate, this should be a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice has come down to $85, which is within my budget and a good deal. I'll take it!"
