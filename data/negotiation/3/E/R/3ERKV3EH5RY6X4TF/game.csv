"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This way we both get a fair deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $10,750 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet at $11,000. It's a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy.",11000.0,Alice,5,
