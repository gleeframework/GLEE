"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in.  My asking price is $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$11,000 is still a bit higher than I want to pay. I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? This way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $10,750 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet at $11,000. It's a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her price of $11,000, which is higher than I'm willing to pay.  I've already negotiated several rounds and it seems she's not going to budge.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  I can get the product for a price I'm comfortable with and avoid further negotiation."
