"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your expressed interest.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I need to stay even closer to my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I really need to get as close to my target as possible.",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that this is a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $960000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",960000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but I'm afraid I need to be even more aggressive with my offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $910000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you, but I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be aggressive with your offer, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $950000. I've already made several concessions, and I feel like this is the lowest price I can accept without losing value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $935000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",935000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I need to be even more aggressive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you, but I believe this is the best price I can offer given my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,10,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options, Bob. I've made several concessions, and I'm not comfortable going any lower than $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to feel confident that this is a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $912500. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",912500.0,Alice,11,
