"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we compromise at $17,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I can't go lower than $15,500.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",15500.0,Alice,5,
