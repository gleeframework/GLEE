I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:**  I know I won't accept anything less than $8,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's potentially attractive:** $10,000 might be a good deal for Bob if he values the product highly.

If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for $8,000."
