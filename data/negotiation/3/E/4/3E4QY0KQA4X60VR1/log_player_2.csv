You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. This gives Alice a clear signal that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her first one, it's still above my maximum.  I will continue to negotiate to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm raising my offer slightly to $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a price closer to my limit.  It's a middle ground that could be appealing to Alice while still giving me some potential savings."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating, but I'm starting to consider the option of buying from John if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying from Alice, but I'm still pushing for a price that's closer to my limit.  This offer is a compromise that might be more appealing to Alice while still giving me some potential savings."
