"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for potential negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price point before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm still within my minimum price range.  It demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're at round 6 and Bob is still offering below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, the time is running out. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $10,000."
