"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $950,000. How about we meet at $925,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, $925,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $937,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $937,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get a better deal. How about we try $927,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",927500.0,Bob,6,
