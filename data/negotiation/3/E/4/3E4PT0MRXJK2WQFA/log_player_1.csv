Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. Starting high allows room for negotiation and the potential to maximize profit. 
* **Justification:**  Simply stating a high price isn't enough. Alice's message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""unique value,"" and ""wise investment"" to make the price seem more palatable.
* **No ultimatum:** Alice avoids language like ""take it or leave it.""  This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:** This strategy assumes Alice has some knowledge about Bob's financial capacity and potential willingness to pay more than $800,000.
* **Negotiation skills:** Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate with Bob. This might involve lowering her asking price, but she should aim to stay above her minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
