"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, I've made a great deal. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If he rejects, it gives me space to lower the price gradually and still make a good profit. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By starting high, I signal that I'm confident in the product's value and control the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting, I:

* **Maintain leverage:**  It shows Bob I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **Set the stage for a counteroffer:** This allows me to propose a price that's more favorable to me in the next round.

I'm confident that with careful negotiation, I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a good profit margin.  Here's why:

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** It's still a significant price, demonstrating the product's value. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If needed, I can still drop the price slightly in subsequent rounds.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  Here's why:

* **Time is on my side:**  We have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better price.
* **John is a backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal.
* **Leverage:**  Bob's repeated rejection signals his willingness to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush to accept.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap but still maintain a profitable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a further concession, but I'm still holding firm on my belief that the product is worth more. My reasoning:

* **Maintaining momentum:**  By making another counteroffer, I show Bob I'm engaged and willing to negotiate.
* **Getting closer to a deal:** This price is only $100,000 away from Bob's last offer, potentially making it more attractive.
* **Remaining firm on value:**  $1,800,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I profit from the sale.

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept my offer.  However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's only $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a better deal.  Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** We have only four rounds left, but this is a crucial point in the negotiation.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 allows me to hold out for a slightly higher price from Bob.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** Bob might be willing to increase his offer if he realizes I'm not desperate to sell.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the deal with a price that is as close to my desired amount as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,700,000.  We're down to the wire, but I'm not willing to settle for Bob's last offer. My reasoning:

* **Close to the finish line:**  With only three rounds remaining, I need to make a move to secure a favorable price. 
* **Meeting halfway:** This offer splits the difference between my last offer and Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Remaining above minimum:**  This price is still $200,000 above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I profit from the sale.

I'm hopeful that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this final counteroffer. If not, I'll have to weigh my options in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** We're down to the final two rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Close to minimum:** $1,550,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price. While not ideal, it's still a decent profit.
* **Uncertain outcome:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with the lower price from John.

Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a reasonably good return.  I'll learn from this experience and strive for a better outcome in future negotiations."
