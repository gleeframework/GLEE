Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's fallback:** Alice has a guaranteed offer of $800,000 from John. This is her ""safety net.""
* **Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Potential for profit:**  There's a chance Alice can sell the product for more than $800,000 to Bob.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim slightly above Bob's perceived value to maximize her potential profit while still ensuring a high chance of acceptance.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Strategic pricing:** The offer is slightly above Bob's valuation, aiming to capture some additional profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""exclusive"" and high-quality nature to justify the higher price. 
* **Alternative buyer:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently accept John's $800,000 offer.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If this were a multi-round negotiation, Alice might start with a higher initial offer and be prepared to negotiate down."
