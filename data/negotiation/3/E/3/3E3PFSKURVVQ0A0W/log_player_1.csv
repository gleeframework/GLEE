"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer of $9,000 is higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but lower than the value I know the product has to Bob ($12,000). Since I'm trying to earn as much money as I can, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.
