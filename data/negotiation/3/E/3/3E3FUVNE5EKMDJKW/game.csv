"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
