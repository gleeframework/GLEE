"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget of $12,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000 either. I can meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $17,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is not willing to go down to Bob's maximum, and $17,000 is still significantly above his budget.  It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John."
