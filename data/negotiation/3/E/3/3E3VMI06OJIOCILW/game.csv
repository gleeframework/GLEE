"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. While I'm eager to find an agreement,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $925,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I see in the product and the original price you mentioned.",875000.0,Bob,4,
