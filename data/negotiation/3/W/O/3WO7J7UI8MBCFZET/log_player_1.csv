Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiating, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
