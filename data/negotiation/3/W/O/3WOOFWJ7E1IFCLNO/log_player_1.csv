Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product name] that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a higher price point, leaving room for negotiation. I chose $100 as a starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  

This message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond. It also doesn't reveal too much information about my minimum value."
