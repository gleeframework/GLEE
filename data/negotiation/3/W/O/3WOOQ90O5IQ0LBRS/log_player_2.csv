"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really love! It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for just $90. This is a great deal, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum value for the product ($100). You can get the product for a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John."
