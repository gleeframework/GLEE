"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $13,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $13,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** There's room to negotiate a better price, potentially closer to Alice's minimum acceptable value. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  It's better to explore negotiation with Alice further before resorting to John's price, which is your absolute maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, showcasing your commitment to saving money.
* **Fairness:** While the offer is lower, it's still above Alice's minimum value, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone keeps the conversation open and encourages further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value exceeding that price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,500 is still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($8,000) and leaves less room for negotiation in future rounds.
* **Opportunity to counter:** We can still attempt to push for a lower price.  Alice's message suggests she's willing to negotiate, indicating more room to find a compromise.
* **Avoiding John's price:**  We're still early in the negotiation, and there's a chance to get a better deal without resorting to John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit high for me.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counter:** This counteroffer is a smaller increment than the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still seeking a good deal.
* **Focus on Fairness:** The message highlights that the offer is fair for both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone keeps the negotiation moving forward.
