"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value exceeding that price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  It allows for a good deal while ensuring we both walk away feeling satisfied. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
