"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $900000. How about we try $925000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're close, but $925000 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $940000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $925000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $930000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",930000.0,Bob,6,
