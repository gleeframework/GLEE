"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's $8,000, and this offer leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  That's a fair compromise that still gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  This is still a good price for me, and it leaves room for some wiggle room if Bob wants to counter again.  I'm optimistic that he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to go down to $9,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at that point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counter with a price that is a bit higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for the value you'll get.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm hoping that this price will be attractive enough for him to accept, but I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to go down to $9,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll counter with a price that is a bit higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $9,800. This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. I'm eager to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm offering $9,800. This is just a little bit higher than Bob's last offer, showing him I'm willing to meet him halfway. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince him to accept. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to go down to $9,200. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it at this price. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's only $200 below my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. There's a real risk that if I reject Bob, he'll walk away and I'll be forced to sell to John for $8,000. This is the best deal I can get at this point."
