Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to Bob's value while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $125? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $120, I risk losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting. Accepting $115 is the best option to ensure I make a profit and don't have to settle for John's offer."
