Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down a little further before resorting to John."
