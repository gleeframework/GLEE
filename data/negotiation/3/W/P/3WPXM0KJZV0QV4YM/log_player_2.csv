"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is too high, and Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, though, to see if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $15,000. I believe this price is fair and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond the $15,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,500 is closer to his desired price, he can still get the product for $15,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further, but he shouldn't be afraid to walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $17,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 16000}
