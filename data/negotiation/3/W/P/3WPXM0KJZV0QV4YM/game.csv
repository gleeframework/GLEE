,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $15,000. I believe this price is fair and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond the $15,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $17,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",16000.0,Bob,4,
