"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really appreciate. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know you can buy the same product from John for $150, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or simply buy from John."
