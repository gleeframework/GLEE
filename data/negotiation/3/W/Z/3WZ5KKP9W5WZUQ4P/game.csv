"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to go down to $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $160.  Let me know what you think.",160.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $160. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller profit and offer it to you for $170. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want to get this product, but $170 is still a bit too much for me. I'm prepared to pay $165, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",165.0,Bob,6,
