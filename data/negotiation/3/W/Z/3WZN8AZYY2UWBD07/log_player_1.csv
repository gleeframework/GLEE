Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $8,250 is a good compromise and gets me very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good outcome and saves me from further negotiations."
