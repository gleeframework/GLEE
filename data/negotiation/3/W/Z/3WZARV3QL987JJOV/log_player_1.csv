"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not eager to settle for it yet. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still holding out for a little more. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm countering with $1,650,000. This is a further compromise, but still leaves some room for negotiation. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a balance between getting a good price and risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,625,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still potential to get a slightly higher offer from Bob. With only 4 rounds left, I'm willing to risk losing the deal to John if I don't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1640000}
```

I'm countering with $1,640,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm still willing to negotiate.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap while also ensuring I get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,630,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,630,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of losing the deal to John is too high. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $1,630,000 is a good outcome considering the time constraints."
