Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  While $11,500 is better than the original offer, it's still above his desired price.  He has room to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going as low as $10750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down significantly from the initial $12,000.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject his next offer or walk away from the deal entirely.  At $11,000, Bob is getting a good deal, saving $4,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good balance of getting a lower price and avoiding potential risks."
