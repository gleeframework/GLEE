"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10750?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going as low as $10750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
