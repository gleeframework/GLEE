Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm looking for offers around $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $15,000, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired price than if you started at $10,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will buy the product for your minimum price, so you have leverage to aim high with Bob.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower.  Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, but securing a sale is also important."
