"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than her own valuation of $8,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation to get a better price. While buying from John for $15,000 is an option, it's best to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening price but still a reasonable markup from her $8,000 valuation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** By starting lower, there's space to meet Alice somewhere in the middle if she's not immediately agreeable.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest in the product, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to a more reasonable price, but it's still above the halfway point between her valuation and my initial offer. There's still room for negotiation. It's worth making one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($9,000) and her current one ($10,500). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward and proposes a specific price without beating around the bush.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The language remains respectful and appreciative, aiming for a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. While $10,200 is slightly higher than I was aiming for, it's a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept and secure the product at a reasonable price."
