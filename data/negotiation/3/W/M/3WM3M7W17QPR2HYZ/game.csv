"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit above your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10200.0,Alice,5,
