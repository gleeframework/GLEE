Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. This is as close to your original offer as I'm willing to get.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000. It makes more sense to cut your losses and secure the product at the lower price from John rather than risking further negotiation with Alice."
