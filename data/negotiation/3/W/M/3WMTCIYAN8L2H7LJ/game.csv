"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit too far out of my budget.  Would you consider $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,175,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,190,000? I'm hoping we can finalize this soon.",1190000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1,190,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,215,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1215000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is it.  My final offer is $1,200,000.  I know that's the value it holds for you, and I believe it's more than fair considering I'm willing to take on the risk.  If we can't agree on this, then we'll have to walk away.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
