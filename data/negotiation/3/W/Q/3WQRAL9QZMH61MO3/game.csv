"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price was a bit high, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I believe this product would be valuable for me, $900,000 is still a bit too high.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still interested in the product, but $850,000 is pushing my budget.  My final offer is $775,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
