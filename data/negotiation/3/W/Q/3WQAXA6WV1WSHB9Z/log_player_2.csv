(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  I'll try to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to my maximum, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Hopefully, Alice will see that this is a fair price, considering the product is worth more to her than it is to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a price in the middle of Alice's last offer and my initial counteroffer.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get the best possible price."
