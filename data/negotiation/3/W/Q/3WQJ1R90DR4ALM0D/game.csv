"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $8,200 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to offer the product for $8,750. This price is closer to your target price, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,5,
