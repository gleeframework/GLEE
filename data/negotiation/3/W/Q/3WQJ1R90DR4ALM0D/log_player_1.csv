"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. It's still a great deal for me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John.  I have 8 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  We're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
