"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to jump at the first offer.  You can use the negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  By offering $100, you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying but also leaving room for compromise.  This is a significant enough drop to make her consider it, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $120. Accepting the offer secures the product at a fair price."
