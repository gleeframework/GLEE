,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $145. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $130?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
