Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll see what Bob's next offer is."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950000.

You have three options:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the chances of getting a price closer to my desired value are slim.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures a good profit and saves time."
