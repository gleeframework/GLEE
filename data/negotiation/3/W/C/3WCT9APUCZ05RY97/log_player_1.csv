"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively high price,  $12,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me a better starting point for potential counteroffers. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000 through the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob.  I'm confident that I can achieve a better price by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us while remaining as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $9,500, it's still far below my desired price point. I've already shown flexibility in lowering my offer, and with 6 rounds remaining, there's still room for further negotiation. I believe I can secure a better price than $9,500 by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but only slightly.  This is to demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise, but also to try and get closer to a price I'm happy with. Bob has shown he's willing to increase his offer, so I believe we can meet somewhere in the middle. I have 5 rounds left, and I'm still confident I can get a better price than $9,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still not enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating.  I have 4 rounds remaining and I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again lowering my price, but this time to $10,250, which is only a $250 difference from Bob's offer.  This demonstrates a significant willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a middle ground with Bob.  I'm hopeful this offer will be accepted, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 2 rounds remaining, there's a high risk that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.  He's only willing to increase his offer incrementally, and I'm hesitant to go much lower than $10,000.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a higher price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
