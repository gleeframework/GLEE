"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $97 isn't quite there yet for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
