Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $90 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start higher, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground seems fairer and may make Bob more agreeable.

It's important to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
