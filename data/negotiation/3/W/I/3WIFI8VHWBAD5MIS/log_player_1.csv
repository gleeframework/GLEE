Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing, you imply scarcity and value. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is as much about gauging Bob's interest as it is about securing the $150.  If he flat out rejects it, you can always come down in a subsequent offer, knowing John provides a safety net at $100."
