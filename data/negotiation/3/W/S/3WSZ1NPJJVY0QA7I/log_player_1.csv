"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm offering it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that it's worth $150 to him. This helps him see the potential benefit of accepting my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to respond and initiate a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  I want to try and push for a higher offer before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $90. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm sure we can both find that agreeable."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm proposing a price of $105, which is halfway between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's counteroffer of $90. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Appealing to Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise, using phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""find that agreeable,"" which can make Bob feel like we're working towards a solution together.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my ideal price point. It's also a good middle ground and shows that he's willing to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit, making it the best option at this stage."
