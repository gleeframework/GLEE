Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that is acceptable. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $120. It's better to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $120 from John."
