"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $155. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $152.50. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $152.50 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $145. If you can't come down to that, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",145.0,Bob,6,
