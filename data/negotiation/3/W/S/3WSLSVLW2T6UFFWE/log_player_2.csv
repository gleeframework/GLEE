"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm happy to make you a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great price, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both her value and John's offer. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, the price is a bit higher than I had in mind. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and professional tone throughout the negotiation is important for a successful outcome.
* **Targeting a Fair Price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value ($8,000) while still staying well below John's backup offer ($12,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to my offer, $9,000 is still significantly higher than her value ($8,000) and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **John as a Backstop:** I have the security of John's offer ($12,000), so there's less pressure to accept a price that's not ideal.
* **Strategic Counter-offering:** Continuing to counter-offer encourages Alice to move closer to a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Movement:**  I'm making a smaller counteroffer this time ($250 less) to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit. 
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" helps to maintain a collaborative atmosphere and encourages Alice to meet me in the middle.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still safely below John's price while inching closer to a potentially acceptable deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she is unwilling to go lower.
* **Unfavorable Movement:** Alice actually increased her offer from $9,000 to $9,200. This suggests she is not genuinely negotiating towards a fair price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** While John's offer is higher, the difference between $9,200 and $12,000 is now small enough that it's worth taking the guaranteed deal and avoiding further negotiation with Alice."
