Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $1,700,000. If that's not acceptable, I'll consider buying from John for $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:** Bob's latest offer is getting too far away from my minimum acceptable price. His threat to go with John for $1,500,000 signals he's unlikely to move significantly higher. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
