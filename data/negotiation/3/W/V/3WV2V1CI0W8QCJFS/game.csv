"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This shows my commitment to buying the product, but it's the absolute highest I can go. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1300000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this unique product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
