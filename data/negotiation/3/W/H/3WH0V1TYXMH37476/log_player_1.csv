Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low amount.  I'm going to counteroffer with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still not enough. I've already offered a significant discount, and I'm not sure how much lower I can go without losing too much.  I've also got a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to him.  It's the best way to ensure I get a good deal."
