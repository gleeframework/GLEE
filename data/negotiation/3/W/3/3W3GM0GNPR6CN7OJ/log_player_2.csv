# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product for $100 from John, so you want to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $105. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 107.50? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
You can get the product for $100 from John, so it's better to take that option than to pay $107.50."
