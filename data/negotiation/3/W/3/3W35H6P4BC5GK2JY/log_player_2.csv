# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair reflection of its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. It's in my best interest to try and get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I value the product at, but also takes into account the value you see in it. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can get a better price. There's still a gap between her price and what I'm willing to pay, and I think there's room for further compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. While I'd prefer a lower price,  it's a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,500,000. It's likely we won't get a lower price, and it's worth accepting this offer to avoid a lengthy negotiation."
