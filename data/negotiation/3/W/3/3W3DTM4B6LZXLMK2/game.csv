"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great price for the value you'll get from the product, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
