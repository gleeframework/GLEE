{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, giving you some profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $11,500 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, making it attractive for him to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This offer provides room for both you and Bob to negotiate if necessary, without needing to immediately go to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still room to negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a great price for the value you'll get from the product, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
