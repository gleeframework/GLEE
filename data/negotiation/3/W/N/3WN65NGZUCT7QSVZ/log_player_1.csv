"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so we begin significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Framing the price as reflecting the product's ""true worth"" and a ""fair starting point"" avoids immediately anchoring to Bob's lower valuation.
* **Leaving Room:** The high starting price allows us to make concessions throughout the negotiation while still aiming for a final price well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than what I had in mind.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and your opening offer.  While it's normal for initial offers to be far apart, accepting this would be a substantial loss. We'll counter in the next round, aiming to bring the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is significantly below the product's market value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the considerable value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly state it's too low.
* **Significant Step Down:**  While we don't want to appear overly eager, a $350,000 reduction signals we're open to negotiation.
* **Reframing Value:**  We re-emphasize the product's benefits to Bob's business, steering away from his low initial offer.
* **Maintaining High Ground:**  We're still considerably above both your minimum and Bob's offer, allowing room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need a price that works for me too.  How about $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, which is a positive sign, but $900,000 is still too far below your $1,500,000 minimum. We have room to negotiate and will aim for a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some progress here. Let's find a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,600,000? I'm confident this price allows both of us to benefit from this deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:**  We start with encouraging language to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Significant Concession:**  A drop to $1,600,000 shows flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  This framing emphasizes a win-win solution and encourages Bob to move closer to your target.
* **Above Minimum:**  Importantly, this counteroffer remains above your $1,500,000 minimum, preserving your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. I could go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,000,000 is his ""absolute limit."" This strongly suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer remains below your $1,500,000 minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed deal with John. While there's a chance Bob could slightly increase his offer, it's unlikely to reach a level that's significantly better than what John is offering."
