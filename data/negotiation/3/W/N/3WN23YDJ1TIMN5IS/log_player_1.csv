"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to see if he's willing to negotiate upwards. This strategy allows for potential profit while leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $10,000 before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still holding out for a better price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for less than $10,000 yet.  I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept the offer. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John at the same price."
