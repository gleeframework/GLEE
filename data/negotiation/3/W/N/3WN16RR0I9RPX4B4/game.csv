"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm only willing to go up to $775,000. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",825000.0,Alice,5,
