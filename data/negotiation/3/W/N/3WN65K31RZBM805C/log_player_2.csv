Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

Alice is clearly holding firm on not going much lower. Accepting $775,000 is a significant savings and a good deal.  It's not worth risking going another round and potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
