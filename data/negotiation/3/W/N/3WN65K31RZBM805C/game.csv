"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's worth $1,200,000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant. Could we settle on $750,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
