"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure will bring you great value. I believe our price of $1,800,000 is a fair and competitive offer. Would you like to accept or make a counteroffer?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product will bring to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,400,000?  It's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I need to see a bit more movement from your side. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package. I think this is a fair offer, considering the value you'll be getting. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
