"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $9,500. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is high enough to incentivize Bob to consider the offer, but low enough that he will be motivated to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, which gives me enough time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains a strong position that I'm confident I can get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not desperate to sell and have time to negotiate further.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again making a counteroffer, this time at $8,800.  This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I believe this is a reasonable price that Bob will likely accept, considering his value for the product. If he rejects this offer, I may consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's important to note that Bob's offer hasn't changed significantly.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed outcome, which is a more secure choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
