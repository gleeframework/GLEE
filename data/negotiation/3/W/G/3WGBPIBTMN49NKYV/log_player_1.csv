Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Not too aggressive:**  A price of $12,000 leaves some room for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away.
* **Protecting my value:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he's already shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial perceived value.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage and shows that I'm not desperate for a sale. This could encourage him to come closer to my desired price. 

**Next step:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,250. It's still a great price for a fantastic product, and I think we can both be happy with this solution.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** This counteroffer directly addresses Bob's concerns while still remaining within my acceptable range.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my value.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Clear price:**  The specific price point helps move the negotiation forward and provides Bob with a concrete proposal to consider.

This counteroffer is designed to encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $10800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited upside:** Bob's offer of $10,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a prolonged process with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Guaranteed value:** Selling to John immediately guarantees me my desired price of $15,000. 

By selling to John, I ensure a quick and certain sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's the most logical choice given the current situation."
