"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, $9,000. This is above Bob's value of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $8,000 as possible, but also want to see if Bob is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
