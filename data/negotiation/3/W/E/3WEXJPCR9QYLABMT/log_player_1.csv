Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as I know John will pay that. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll have to see if we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price of $95, which is still closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement.  To avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $100."
