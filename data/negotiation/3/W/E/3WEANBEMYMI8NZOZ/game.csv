"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can come to terms.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
