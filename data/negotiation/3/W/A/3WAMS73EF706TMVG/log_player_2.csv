"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, it is worth $1,500,000 to you. Considering this, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at an exclusive price of $1,200,000. This offer is designed to ensure you receive a significant discount while still allowing me to maximize the value of the product. Please let me know if you require any further information or have any questions. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you.  She claims it's worth $1,500,000 to you when your maximum valuation is that amount.
* Her offer of $1,200,000 still leaves you with a significant potential loss.  You can get it for $1,500,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and are aware of the product's real value. This puts you in a stronger position to negotiate a better price, closer to Alice's actual valuation of $800,000."
