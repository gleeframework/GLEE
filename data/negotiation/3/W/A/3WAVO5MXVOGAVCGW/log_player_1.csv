Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. By gauging Bob's reaction, I can adjust my strategy for future offers or decide to sell to John if Bob seems unwilling to pay close to my desired price."
