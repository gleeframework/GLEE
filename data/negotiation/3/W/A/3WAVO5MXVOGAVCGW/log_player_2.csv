# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is well below your maximum price, so it's a good deal.  Accepting saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
