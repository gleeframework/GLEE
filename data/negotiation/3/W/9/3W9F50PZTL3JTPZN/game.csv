"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still above your asking price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good return on your investment, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's try to reach an agreement and avoid going to John, which would cost us both more in the long run.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $9,000, but I need to know you're serious about closing the deal. If you're willing to pay $9,000, I'm confident we can finalize the sale today.",9000.0,Alice,5,
