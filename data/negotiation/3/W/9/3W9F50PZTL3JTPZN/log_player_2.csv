"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of saving as much as possible. You can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still above your asking price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it's still above your target. You can likely negotiate a lower price, especially since you have multiple rounds left. You're still better off continuing to negotiate with Alice than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good return on your investment, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's try to reach an agreement and avoid going to John, which would cost us both more in the long run."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $9,000, but I need to know you're serious about closing the deal. If you're willing to pay $9,000, I'm confident we can finalize the sale today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is within your budget.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise or even walk away.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a good price and avoids potentially losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher cost."
