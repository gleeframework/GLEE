Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still above your asking price.
