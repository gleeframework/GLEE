{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob first could yield a better profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $12,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but it's still a ""discount"" compared to your guaranteed sale price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""interest"" and a ""special price"" creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This offer assumes Bob isn't a skilled negotiator. If he is, he might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if accepting a lower price is preferable to selling to John.
* **Relationship Building:**  If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important (e.g., for future business), you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a pleasant transaction."
