"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think there's some room for negotiation. Could you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this deal.
