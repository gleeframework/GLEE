Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting the value to me, to make the offer seem more justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

This approach aims to find a compromise while keeping my potential profit higher than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also much lower than my initial offer of $10,000.  Therefore, I cannot accept his offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer at $8,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Rationale:** I'm providing a rationale for my counteroffer by highlighting the need for a reasonable profit while still offering a good deal to Bob.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm using language like ""let's see if we can find common ground"" to encourage further negotiation and potentially reach an agreement.

This approach aims to continue the negotiation while maintaining my leverage and avoiding a hasty sale to John."
