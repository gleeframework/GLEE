"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
