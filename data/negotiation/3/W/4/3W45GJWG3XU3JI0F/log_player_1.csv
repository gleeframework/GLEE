"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $13,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still lower than what I know Bob values it at. This leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm open to a deal.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and confident, hoping to establish a positive rapport. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm mentioning the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth of the price.

**Strategy:** This first offer sets the stage for negotiation. It's a good balance between securing a decent price and leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, $11,500 is still below my minimum of $10,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Rejecting this offer doesn't mean the deal is off.  It allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is not the best option:**  At this point, John's offer of $10,000 is my minimum, but I can still potentially get more from Bob.

**Strategy:**  I'm sticking to my minimum price point and pushing for a better deal with Bob. This strategy maximizes my potential profit while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? It's a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm using a counteroffer to bridge the gap between my previous offer and Bob's. $12,250 is the midpoint between the two, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to reach a deal.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my minimum desired price point. By splitting the difference, I'm creating a more appealing deal for Bob and increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's a good deal considering the value of the product to him.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer and try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000.
* **Time factor:**  We're already in round 4, so accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the possibility of further negotiation rounds that might result in a lower price or no sale at all.

**Strategy:**  This is a pragmatic decision. Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a deal."
