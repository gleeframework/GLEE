"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you in the middle at $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.5 is closer to your ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming for a price closer to $85. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference at $86.25? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86.25}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to give a bit more. How about we meet at $86.00? I'm getting a bit anxious to sell this product, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $86, which is very close to your counteroffer of $86.25.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price.  You're saving $4 compared to buying from John, and you've successfully negotiated a price you're comfortable with.  Accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
