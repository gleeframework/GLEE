Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, it's best to start with an offer closer to your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation or a counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""limited time"", ""great deal"") might make the offer more appealing.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering it slightly below your guaranteed price with John ($150), you increase the chances of Bob accepting while still maximizing your potential profit."
