Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not looking to break the bank. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $9,800 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's compromise at $10,200. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, which would be $10,000. Can you consider this offer?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
