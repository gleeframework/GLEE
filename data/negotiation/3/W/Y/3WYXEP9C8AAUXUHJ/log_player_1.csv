Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a one-of-a-kind item with [briefly describe the product's value proposition, but avoid revealing too much information]. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $20,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob is hesitant.  
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's unique value without revealing all its secrets sparks curiosity and encourages Bob to consider its worth.
* **Open-Ended:** The message ends with an open-ended question, giving Bob space to respond and start the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer.  You will need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your assessment of his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:** While Bob is interested, his initial offer is very low. There's potential for a better deal with a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000 gives you leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** 

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer. Consider a price that's closer to your desired price point while still being enticing enough to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. For example, you might offer $17,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? It's still a great deal considering the unique value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $16,000 is a compromise that is closer to your desired price point of $15,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reminding Bob about the product's unique value helps justify the price and encourages him to consider it more seriously.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking for Bob's opinion keeps the conversation open and encourages him to respond, allowing for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he has shown willingness to compromise, $13,500 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:**  Bob has already rejected two offers, and his counteroffers are getting closer to his initial price. It's likely further negotiation won't significantly improve the deal.
* **John offers a guaranteed sale:**  You have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is a better outcome than selling to Bob at $13,500.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John for $15,000 ensures you receive a price that meets your minimum requirements. While you could continue to negotiate with Bob, the potential gains are too low to risk losing the sale to John."
