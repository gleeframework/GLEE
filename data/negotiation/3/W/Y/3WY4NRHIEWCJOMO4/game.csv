"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $81? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice! I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we go with $79? It's the last bit of wiggle room I have, but I really want to make this deal work.",79.0,Bob,6,
