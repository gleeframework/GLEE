Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the details you provided. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. This would allow me to stay within my budget and still acquire this valuable product.  Let me know if you're open to this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
