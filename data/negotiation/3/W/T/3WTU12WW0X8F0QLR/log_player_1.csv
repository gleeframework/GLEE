"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly less than your own valuation."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000), Alice anchors the negotiation high. This leaves room for concessions while still aiming for a price significantly above her minimum ($800,000).
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the high price (""Given its value..."") makes it seem less arbitrary and more palatable to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language (""starting point for negotiation"") explicitly signals that Alice is willing to discuss the price further, encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the initial price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  Considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to benefit from a deal, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is above Alice's minimum, it's still a significant distance from her initial asking price and leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. Alice has room to negotiate and should try to meet somewhere in the middle.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a last resort option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the value this product holds.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the significant value the product offers while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** Alice needs to show she's willing to negotiate by reducing her price. However, the decrease is moderate ($50,000), indicating she's still aiming high.
* **Justification:**  Again, providing a reason for the price (""significant value..."") reinforces the product's worth and makes the concession seem more strategic than desperate.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The language (""find a middle ground"") explicitly states Alice's goal, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to her desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a more mutually beneficial deal.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you receive a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer only increased by $25,000. At this pace, it's unlikely they'll reach a price significantly above $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds.
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a solid backup offer from John ($800,000). This gives her leverage to push for a better deal with Bob. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  While there's a risk Bob might walk away, Alice is betting that his valuation of $1,200,000 will motivate him to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $975,000 undervalues the significant benefits this product offers. To move things along, I'm proposing $1,025,000.  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring I receive a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice is holding firm above the $1,000,000 mark, signaling she's serious about getting a strong price. 
* **Small Concession:**  A $25,000 decrease shows she's willing to move, but it's a calculated risk to see if Bob will make a significant jump in his next counter.
* **Time Pressure:**  As rounds progress, both parties become aware of the time constraint, potentially pushing them toward a deal. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While not mentioned directly, Alice's willingness to walk away is implied by her firm stance, reminding Bob she has alternatives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. To demonstrate my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price strikes a balance between our respective needs and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Expectations:**  Bob has reached Alice's psychological target of $1,000,000. This price provides a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, the difference is unlikely to be substantial enough to justify the risk of him walking away or further negotiation rounds.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially drawn-out negotiations and secures the profit."
