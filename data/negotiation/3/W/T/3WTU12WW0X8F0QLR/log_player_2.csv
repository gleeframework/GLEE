"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly less than your own valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is still too high.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is always an option, there's still potential to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the initial price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay.  Considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to benefit from a deal, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer but is still above her minimum desired price of $800,000.  It signals to Alice that Bob is serious about a deal, but he's also not willing to overpay.  This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the value this product holds.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the significant value the product offers while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal if he continues negotiating. While buying from John is always an option, the potential to save even more money by continuing with Alice makes rejecting the offer the best choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still aiming for a more mutually beneficial deal.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you receive a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate and reach a deal.  This counteroffer is still below Alice's current offer but is higher than his previous counteroffer, showing progress.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a faster deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. However, $975,000 undervalues the significant benefits this product offers. To move things along, I'm proposing $1,025,000.  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring I receive a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit lower, but Bob can likely still get a better deal. There's still room to negotiate, and he doesn't want to rush into a deal that's less than ideal.  While John remains an option, the potential for further savings with Alice outweighs the risk of waiting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. To demonstrate my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price strikes a balance between our respective needs and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating his commitment to finding a deal. This counteroffer is a significant increase from his previous offer but is still below Alice's current offer. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in the next few rounds."
