,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $115 for it, what do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
