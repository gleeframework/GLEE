This offer is a starting point. It is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a $10,000 limit. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm still not able to meet the $11,000 price point. Could you possibly lower it to $10,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $10,750?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still working within a strict budget, and I'm unable to meet the $10,750 price point. Could you consider lowering it to $10,600? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. Even though I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise any further. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $12,000, so that's what I'll do."
