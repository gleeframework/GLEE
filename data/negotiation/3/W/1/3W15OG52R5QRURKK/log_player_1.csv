"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if he's willing to pay this much right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer. I'm hoping this price will be enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm offering $10,200. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still within a reasonable range for both of us. I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Bob, as we are getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,900 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if we can finally close this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10050}
```

This time, I'm offering $10,050. This is a very slight increase from my previous offer, but it's important to remember that we're already in the latter half of the negotiations and I'm hoping this small bump will be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm also keeping in mind that I could always sell to John for $10,000 if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time. I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000 from John. I'm going to sell the product to John."
