"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1,000,000. It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
