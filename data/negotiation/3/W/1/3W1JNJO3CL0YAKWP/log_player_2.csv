"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing it's worth more to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option for $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, so it makes sense to reject her initial offer and see if she counter-offers."
