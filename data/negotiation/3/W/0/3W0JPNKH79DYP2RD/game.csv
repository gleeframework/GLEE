"I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $165. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140, but I'm willing to compromise at $155. That's the lowest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
