Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. It makes more sense to reject and counteroffer, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, appreciate you showing interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my limit, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'll reject and try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $125.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $125 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price range. While I could continue negotiating, I've already used several rounds and there's no guarantee she'll come down further. Buying from John for $100 guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids further negotiation."
