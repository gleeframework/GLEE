**Reasoning:**  $18,000 is way above your budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear boundary and signals my serious intent to buy. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal quickly."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $16,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price. There are still 7 rounds left."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $14,500 is a significant improvement from Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than my comfortable budget. I'm still optimistic about negotiating a lower price, and there's no need to rush into a decision. There are still 5 rounds left."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $12,000. This shows continued commitment to the negotiation while staying within a range that I'm comfortable with.  It's a significant discount from Alice's last offer, but hopefully, it's enough to encourage her to consider a deal."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is getting closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm committed to exploring further negotiation, and I believe there's still room for Alice to come down further. I have 3 rounds left, so there's time to find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to meet Alice halfway.  With only two rounds left, it's time to push for a final agreement. If Alice rejects this, I'll likely have to accept her next offer or go with John, as I'm nearing my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $13,750 is still above my preferred price, but it's the closest we've gotten. We're down to the final round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $13,000, I'm willing to accept this price to secure the product.  It's still cheaper than John's offer and a fair compromise given the time constraints."
