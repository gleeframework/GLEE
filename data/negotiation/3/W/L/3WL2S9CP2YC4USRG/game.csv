"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price closer to your budget while still reflecting the value of the product? My counteroffer is $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and you to still get a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
