"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how far he might be willing to go.
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the backup option of John at $800,000, so there's less risk in starting high. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it while still being a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own stated value ($800,000). This suggests he has room to move considerably.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** By not immediately accepting a low offer, you reinforce the product's worth.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upward:**  You can now steer the negotiation towards a more reasonable price range. 

While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob, and there's potential for a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you, even beyond the $800,000 you mentioned it's worth.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,000,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer goes slightly below the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's offer. This signals flexibility on your part while still aiming high.
* **Reinforcing Value:** By reiterating the product's potential to exceed even Bob's perceived value, you maintain a strong position. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  There's still a gap between your counteroffer and your minimum, but it creates space for Bob to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** While Bob increased his offer to $750,000, it remains below both your minimum ($800,000) and his own perceived value.
* **Negotiating Room:** Bob's incremental increase suggests he's willing to negotiate further. By rejecting, you encourage him to move closer to your desired price range.
* **John as Backup:** You still have the security of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price.

Continuing the negotiation keeps the potential for a more favorable outcome compared to accepting a below-value offer or selling to John prematurely."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be completely transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $800,000.  I'm willing to accept that if we can close the deal now. This offer reflects the true value of what I'm providing and my desire to work with you."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal Your Minimum (Strategically):** By revealing your minimum, you create a sense of transparency and urgency. This shows Bob you're serious about closing the deal but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Justify the Price:** You emphasize the product's value and your willingness to work with Bob. This helps justify your minimum price without seeming inflexible.
* **Prompt a Decision:** Offering your bottom line at this stage encourages Bob to make a decision â€“ either meet your price or risk losing the deal.

This approach aims to achieve a win-win outcome. Bob gets the product at a price he acknowledges is fair, and you secure your minimum acceptable return."
