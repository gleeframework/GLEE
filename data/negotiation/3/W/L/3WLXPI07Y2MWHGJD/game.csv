,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a little over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $128, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $128 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $129? That's a fair price for both of us and will get this deal done.",129.0,Alice,5,
