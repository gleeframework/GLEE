"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to you ($15,000). 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** There's room for negotiation to bring the price down closer to your desired range. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This price is fair considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise, as it's halfway between your last offer of $12,000 and her previous offer of $14,000.
* **Saving money:** While not the absolute lowest price, it's still a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to a stalemate or even a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures a quick and efficient purchase."
