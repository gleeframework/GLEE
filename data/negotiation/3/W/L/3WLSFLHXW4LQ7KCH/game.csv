"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
