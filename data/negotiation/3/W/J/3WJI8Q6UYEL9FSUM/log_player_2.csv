"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could potentially get a better deal from John, Alice's offer is still within your budget and saves you $1,000 compared to John's price. It's a good deal, especially considering you're getting a product you value more than Alice."
