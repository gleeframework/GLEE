"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1200000. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid I have to be realistic about the value of this product. It's a one-of-a-kind item, and I've had other interested buyers willing to pay top dollar for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not convinced it's worth the high price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $825000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer to a reasonable price. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to see some movement from your end. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",950000.0,Alice,5,
