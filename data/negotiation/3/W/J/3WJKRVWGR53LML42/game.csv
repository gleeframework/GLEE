"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your willingness to negotiate, $700000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This would still provide a good value for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $750000 is still not quite in the range I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which would be a significant compromise on my end. This offers a good value for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
