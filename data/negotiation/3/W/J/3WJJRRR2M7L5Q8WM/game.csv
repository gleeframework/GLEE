"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a significant price difference, and I'd like to discuss further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows you to get a great product at a price that's fair for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. How about we try $875,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your willingness to go up a bit. However, $875,000 is still too far below what I need.  Let's try $925,000. This compromise would allow me to get closer to my target while giving you a great deal on a valuable product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $925,000. How about $900,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,6,
