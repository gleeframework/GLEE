Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is higher than $800,000, giving Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation without sacrificing too much.
* **It's a clear and direct offer:**  The message is concise and gets straight to the point.

By offering this price, I'm aiming to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation open. I'm confident that I can negotiate a final price that benefits both of us."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a significant price difference, and I'd like to discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows you to get a great product at a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. How about we try $875,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe the product is worth more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your willingness to go up a bit. However, $875,000 is still too far below what I need.  Let's try $925,000. This compromise would allow me to get closer to my target while giving you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $925,000. How about $900,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good price, considering it's closer to my minimum of $1,000,000.  It's also a good compromise, as it's halfway between our last offers.  

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm confident that I can find other opportunities to make up for the difference in price."
