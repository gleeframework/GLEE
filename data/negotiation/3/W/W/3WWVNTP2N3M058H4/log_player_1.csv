Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $11,000. This is intentionally higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. There are a few reasons for this:

* **Negotiation leverage:**  Starting high gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Exploring Bob's interest:** By offering a higher price, I can gauge Bob's real interest in the product. If he's willing to accept a price close to my initial offer, it means he values the product more than I initially thought. 
* **Time constraint:**  While I can always sell to John for $10,000, this initial high offer allows me to quickly see if Bob is a serious buyer.

I'm open to negotiating further with Bob if he makes a counteroffer, but ultimately, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. My goal is to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and Bob's last offer of $9,000. It shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to sell for significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. This allows for further negotiation while keeping me closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still get a slightly higher price by making another counteroffer.
* **Time pressure:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, I want to explore if a better deal with Bob is possible. 

I'm going to make a counteroffer closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer of $10,250 is a compromise. It's still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it shows that I'm flexible and willing to meet halfway. This leaves room for further negotiation without being too far from my goal. 

I'm hoping that by making a reasonable counteroffer, I can encourage Bob to accept and close the deal, while still ensuring I receive a price that is fair to me."
