Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and still leaving some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. Here's why:

* **For you:** You're earning $95, which is closer to your minimum of $100 than selling to John for $100. 
* **For Bob:** He's getting the product for $15 less than his perceived value, which is a significant discount for him.

This strategy increases your chance of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a good price for you."
