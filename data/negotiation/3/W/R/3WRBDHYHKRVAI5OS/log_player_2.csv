"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer, hoping to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, considering the value you've expressed. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You can still potentially negotiate a lower price. Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows you to continue pushing for a price closer to your target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to move forward with this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than your budget.  While you could continue to counter-offer, it's getting risky. Further negotiation might not yield a satisfactory result, and the risk of Alice walking away entirely is increasing. It's more prudent to lock in the guaranteed price of $800,000 from John and avoid further uncertainty."
