"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and provides a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $10,000. Would that be acceptable?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your price limit, but I also need to be fair to the value of this product. Let's make this our final offer: $14,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I still can't justify that price. My absolute limit is $11,000. If that's not workable, I understand, but I hope we can make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
