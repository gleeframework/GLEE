Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and provides a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $10,000. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your price limit, but I also need to be fair to the value of this product. Let's make this our final offer: $14,000.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I still can't justify that price. My absolute limit is $11,000. If that's not workable, I understand, but I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's still far from our minimum acceptable price.  At this stage, the difference in our positions makes it unlikely we'll reach a deal that's significantly better than John's offer.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
