"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I believe the product is worth closer to my initial price, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This reflects the true value of what the product brings.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on your price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,375,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,337,500?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",1337500.0,Bob,4,
