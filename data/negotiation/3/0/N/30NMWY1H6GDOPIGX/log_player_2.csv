"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice. $110 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to meet in the middle of the difference between Alice's initial offer and my ideal price. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better, we're still aiming for a lower price. We'll continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're inching closer. Offering $95 keeps the negotiation moving and puts a firm but fair offer on the table. We're getting close to a point where I might consider John's offer if Alice doesn't budge."
