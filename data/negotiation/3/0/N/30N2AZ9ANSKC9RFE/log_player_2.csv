"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully nurtured and it's ready to be put to good use. I'm offering it to you for $11500.  I know it's worth more than that to you, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob.  Bob should reject the offer and buy from John to save $500."
