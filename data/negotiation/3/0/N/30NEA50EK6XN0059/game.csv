"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really like the product, but I'm only able to pay $105 for it right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $110?  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want this product, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107.50 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $109.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",109.0,Alice,5,
