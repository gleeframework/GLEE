"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $115 is a little higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you consider $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about $110?  That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for Bob, as it is still below his maximum price of $120. It's also a fair price for Alice, as she's willing to sell for $100.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice."
