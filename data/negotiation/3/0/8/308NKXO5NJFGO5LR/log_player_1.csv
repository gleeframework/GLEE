""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to negotiate a deal, accepting this would be a substantial loss. I believe there's room for a more favorable outcome in further rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I propose $900,000.  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. Considering the market value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between the initial asking price and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price, and while there might be a small opportunity for a higher price, it's getting close enough to my desired range to accept and avoid further risk of losing the deal."
