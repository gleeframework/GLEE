"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,200. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,800.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  Let's do $8,900.  I believe this is a fair price that will allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,950. It's a small increase, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8950.0,Alice,7,
