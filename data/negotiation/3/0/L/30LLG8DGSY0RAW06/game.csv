"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $1,125,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the value this product brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,562,500. This offer reflects my serious interest while respecting your bottom line.",1562500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the intrinsic value here. To be frank, selling for anything under $1,750,000 would be difficult for me to justify. I'm proposing we settle at that price. It's a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
