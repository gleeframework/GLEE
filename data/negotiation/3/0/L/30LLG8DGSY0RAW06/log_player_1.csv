Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,562,500. This offer reflects my serious interest while respecting your bottom line.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Explanation:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable point, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We're willing to walk away with John's offer, so we have leverage. Let's counter and see if we can push closer to $1,750,000 or higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the intrinsic value here. To be frank, selling for anything under $1,750,000 would be difficult for me to justify. I'm proposing we settle at that price. It's a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,625,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is a good deal at this point.  While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1,750,000, continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away. Accepting this offer ensures a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price and avoids the possibility of the deal falling through entirely."
