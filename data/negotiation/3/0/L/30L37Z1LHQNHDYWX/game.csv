"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate you highlighting the value, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,500.  I'm confident this would be a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $10,250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. $10,250 is getting closer, but I'm still stuck at my budget.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price considering we're both meeting in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'll go down to $9,750. It's a good price, and I think we can both be happy with it.",9750.0,Alice,7,
