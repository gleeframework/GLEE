"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the value. However, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from $12,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $9,500 makes the most sense strategically. It's a strong profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely."
