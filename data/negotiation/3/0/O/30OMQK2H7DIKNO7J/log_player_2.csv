"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and functionality, it's valued at $120 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I propose we find a fair middle ground. Would you be interested in acquiring this product for $100? This price allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is a discount from her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at your desired price."
