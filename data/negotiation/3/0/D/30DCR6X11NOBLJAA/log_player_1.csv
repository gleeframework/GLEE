Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To move forward, I could consider $1,100,000. This still allows you a substantial profit margin and reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We're making a concession by lowering the price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, signaling flexibility.
* **Justification:**  We're justifying our counteroffer by highlighting the product's value and the potential profit margin for Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us closer to our desired price range while encouraging Bob to engage in a more reasonable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be open to $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Trend:** Bob's offers are increasing, suggesting he's willing to pay more than his initial offer.
* **Potential for More:** We're still significantly above our minimum and within a range where Bob finds value.
* **Negotiation Power:** We have John as a backup offer, giving us leverage to push for a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures you acquire this valuable product at a fair price."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** We're making a substantial concession by dropping to $1,050,000, demonstrating our eagerness to close the deal.
* **Framing the Offer:** We're framing this counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we approach the halfway point in the negotiation, applying a subtle time pressure can encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This offer still keeps us well above our minimum acceptable price, securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  I think we can close the gap quickly. How about $1,010,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,010,000 is above our $1,000,000 minimum and provides a profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is unlikely to be substantial.  
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
