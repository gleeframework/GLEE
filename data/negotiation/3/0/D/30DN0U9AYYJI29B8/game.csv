"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and pay $1,050,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you're placing on the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
