Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a price that's higher than what it's worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still potentially earning a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up slightly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
``` 

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $112. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to risk going lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $120."
