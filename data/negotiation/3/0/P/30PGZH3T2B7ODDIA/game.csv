"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $520,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",520000.0,Alice,3,
