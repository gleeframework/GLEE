Round 4

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering prices below my minimum ($800,000). While he's showing willingness to negotiate, his increments are small. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob not meeting my price."
