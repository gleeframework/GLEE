"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $14,000?  This is a fair compromise for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know what you think!",15500.0,Alice,5,
