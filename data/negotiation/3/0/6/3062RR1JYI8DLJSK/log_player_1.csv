{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This price is a good starting point because it's closer to my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while setting a clear price expectation. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe I can't exceed $10,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,000?  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and highlights the fairness of the new price while emphasizing the value of the product. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe $10,000 is the maximum I can afford for this product. Could we possibly meet at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with selling it for that price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired value.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,250:** This offer is a final attempt to find a middle ground. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, and hopefully, it will be appealing enough for him to accept. 
* **Message:**  The message remains positive and highlights the fairness of the offer while showing a willingness to compromise. 

I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be successful.  If Bob rejects it, I will consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I really appreciate your efforts to meet my budget constraints. I'd like to propose $11,000 as a compromise. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $11,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $11,250.  This price is still below my ideal selling price of $12,000, but it is significantly better than his initial offer of $10,000.  

Given that Bob has been negotiating in good faith and has made a reasonable final offer, I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $11,000.  This will allow me to get a decent price for the product while also avoiding the hassle of further negotiations or selling to John."
