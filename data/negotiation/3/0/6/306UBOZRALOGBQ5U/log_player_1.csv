{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving you some room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's below your $120 minimum, leaving room to potentially lower the price if Bob rejects your offer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $100 is a fair price to ask initially, considering the product's value to you.

By offering this price, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear expectation for Bob. This approach will hopefully lead to a successful deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I'm not sure I can justify spending $100 on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum of $120 and even lower than your initial offer of $100.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a good price for a product like this, and it gives you a fair saving. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  Moving from $70 to $90 shows you're willing to negotiate but not give away the product at a huge loss.
* **It's closer to your desired price:** $90 is closer to your minimum of $120 than Bob's offer,  improving your potential profit.
* **It's still below your initial offer:**  By lowering the price from $100, you demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 

Hopefully, this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob to strike a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $85, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you do that for me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to your minimum of $120, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price even closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $85.  I'm still a bit away from that price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and my last offer of $90.  How about $87.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

This counteroffer is strategically designed:

* **It's a compromise:**  You're offering a price in the middle of Bob's offer and your previous one, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **It's closer to your desired price:** $87.50 is closer to your minimum of $120 than Bob's offer,  improving your potential profit.
* **It's still above Bob's offer:** By not accepting Bob's $85, you demonstrate that you're aiming for a higher price while also leaving room for one final negotiation round if needed.

This counteroffer is a strong move to try and close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $85. I'd like to make a final offer of $82.50. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $82.50 is closer to your minimum of $120 than Bob's previous offer, it's still below your desired price and you've already reached the end of the negotiation. Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $120,  selling to John is the best option to maximize your profit."
