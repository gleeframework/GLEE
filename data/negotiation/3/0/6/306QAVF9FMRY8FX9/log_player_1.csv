I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum value of $80, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm willing to come down slightly to $90. This is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is only slightly lower than my minimum desired price and significantly better than selling to John. I'll accept his offer to finalize the sale."
