While $11,500 is more than John's offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm willing to risk them for a better deal."

I'm still holding out for a better price. While I'm getting close to John's offer, I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,500. We have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a higher price with Bob."

I'm making a small concession here, but I'm still trying to get as close to $12,000 as possible.  With only three rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap."

Bob's offer is too low, and with only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better deal.  Selling to John ensures I get a fair price."
