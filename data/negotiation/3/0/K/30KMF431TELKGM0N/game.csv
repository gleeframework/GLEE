"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
