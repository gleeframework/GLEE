"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant savings for me, and it's closer to your asking price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I still need to reach a price that works for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,012,500? It's a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $990,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
