Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to him, I'll aim to maximize my earnings. I'll offer the product to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, which is $1,200,000.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $1,500,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
