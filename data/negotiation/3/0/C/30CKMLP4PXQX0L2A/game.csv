"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe the value you'll gain from it will far outweigh the investment.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
