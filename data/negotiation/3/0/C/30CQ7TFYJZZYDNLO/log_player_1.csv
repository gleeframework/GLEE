Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can offer. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have costs, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer. It's the most I can reasonably offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

We are getting closer, but I'm still willing to negotiate further since we are still below John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However,  $1,525,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. Let's try $1,450,000. This is a significant offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

We're getting very close to John's offer, but I believe I can still try to get a slightly better deal from Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's make this happen - how about $1,475,000? This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1475000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We are reaching the later rounds, and while we have time, dragging it out too long increases the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Finality:**  Presenting this as my ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic position:**  This offer is a very slight concession from my previous offer, signaling that I'm getting close to my limit. It leaves Bob with a tough choice: accept a slightly higher price or risk losing the deal altogether."
