Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000.  This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also a good starting point because I know I can always sell the product to John for $15,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and counter offer. I want to make sure I get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is a compromise, as it's still higher than what Bob offered but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is just below my minimum of $15,000, but it's still a good deal. I'm going to accept his offer, as it's better than selling to John for the same amount and saves me the time and energy of further negotiations."
