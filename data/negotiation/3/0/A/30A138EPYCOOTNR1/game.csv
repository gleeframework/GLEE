"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for this product.

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9000.
