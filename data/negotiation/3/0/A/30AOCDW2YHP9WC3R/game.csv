"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's try $850,000. That's a considerable discount from my initial offer and still a great deal for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. Would you be willing to settle at $725,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the current market.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still a bit below my expectations. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product for you, while also allowing me to make a profit. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
