"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively low offer to see how much bargaining power I have. There's a chance Alice might accept it, and even if she doesn't, it sets a lower point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Targeting Her Value:**  I know the product is worth $120 to Alice.  There's a chance she'll accept this to make a sale, even if it's at her minimum. 
* **John as Backup:**  If Alice rejects this, I'm getting close to my limit. I can always buy from John for $150, so I don't want to go much higher than this offer."
