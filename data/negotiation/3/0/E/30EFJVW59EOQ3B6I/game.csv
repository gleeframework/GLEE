"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product, considering its potential benefits for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's potential. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $2,000,000.  This takes into account its value while recognizing your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This represents a significant step closer to your desired price while still being within my budget.  Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, it's essential we find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  My final offer is $1,800,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the long-term benefits this product will bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us.  $1,800,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
