Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum allows for the possibility of Bob negotiating down, still landing you a profit.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
