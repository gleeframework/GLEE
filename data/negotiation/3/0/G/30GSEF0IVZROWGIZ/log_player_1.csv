Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and high demand, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows her to start significantly higher.
* **Justification for the price:**  By mentioning ""unique value"" and ""high demand,"" Alice creates a sense of scarcity and justifies the high price without explicitly revealing her minimum.
* **Time pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:** This offer assumes Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If Alice knows Bob is a very tough negotiator, she might need to start lower.
* **Risk tolerance:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. Alice needs to decide if the potential for higher profit outweighs the risk of going straight to her backup buyer."
