You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is way too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really want to make this deal work, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $85, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John."
