Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to accommodate them. In light of this, I am proposing a revised price of $90 for the product. This still reflects the value we place on it while being more aligned with your current budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit.  It's better to go with John's offer and secure the product at my target price."
