,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price better reflects the product's value and aligns with my budget. I'm excited about the potential of this product, and I'm willing to move forward at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can go as low as $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential benefits it offers you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,325,000?  This is my final offer.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,325,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
