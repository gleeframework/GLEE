"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price better reflects the product's value and aligns with my budget. I'm excited about the potential of this product, and I'm willing to move forward at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can go as low as $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential benefits it offers you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and has steadily increased his offer.  While $1,300,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. We are aiming for a win-win scenario, not just to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,325,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By stating this is my final offer, I am signaling to Bob that this is a take-it-or-leave-it situation. This can push him to accept if he truly values the product.  We are splitting the difference of his previous offer and my last offer, showing willingness to compromise but also firmness on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,325,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has shown he is willing to negotiate, but this is likely close to his maximum price. Accepting this offer secures a very good profit ($1,320,000) and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing further.  While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, it's not worth the potential loss of walking away with nothing if the deal falls through."
