"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity. While I see the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still represents a significant profit for you. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This still allows you a considerable return on your investment and reflects the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my ideal price point. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal quickly. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
