"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also aware that I can always go to John if the deal doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to go to $92.  If we can agree on that, I'll take the product today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn.  Accepting his offer will secure a good profit for me."
