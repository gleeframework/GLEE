"Alice, your product sounds promising, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still committed to getting closer to the value this product holds for you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business, and I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to facilitate a deal.  This price reflects the potential of this product and allows for a win-win situation for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price reflects the value we both see in the product, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
