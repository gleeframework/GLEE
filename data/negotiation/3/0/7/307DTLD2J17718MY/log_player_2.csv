"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1 million for you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $950,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds promising, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money. However, it's still above Alice's minimum value, leaving room for compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the shared value of the product helps build a collaborative tone, making it less likely Alice will feel pressured. 
* **Direct Approach:** A clear message and specific price make Bob's intention clear and avoids ambiguity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still committed to getting closer to the value this product holds for you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business, and I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to facilitate a deal.  This price reflects the potential of this product and allows for a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:**  While Alice has come down in price, $900,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility. This suggests further negotiation is possible. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John at $1,000,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice."

This price reflects the value we both see in the product, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
