"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product right now, I'm confident it holds significant value.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I believe it represents a compelling investment opportunity. Please consider this offer carefully. If you decline, I will be selling the product to another buyer for $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
