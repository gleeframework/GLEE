"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a good price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this work!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's make this final offer: $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product while still getting a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
