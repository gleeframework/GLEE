"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high ($15,000) and exceeds Bob's budget of $12,000.  It's better to reject and counter-offer to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about $13,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, $13,500 is still above Bob's budget. It's better to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Let's try $12,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $14,000 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for Bob, who is looking to spend no more than $12,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
