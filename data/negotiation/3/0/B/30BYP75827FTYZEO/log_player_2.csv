"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high value and potential impact on your projects, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $14,000. This represents a substantial savings compared to its market value of $15,000, while still ensuring a fair return for us. I am confident that this investment will pay off handsomely for you. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($14,000) is better than John's ($15,000), but still above your $15,000 limit. 
* There's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer is already below your maximum.
* By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about buying, but not at any price. This might encourage her to come down further."
