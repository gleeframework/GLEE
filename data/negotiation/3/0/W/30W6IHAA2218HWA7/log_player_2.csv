# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.

Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $180 is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $120. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still too high. Let's try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $110, and we can get the product for $100 from John.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
