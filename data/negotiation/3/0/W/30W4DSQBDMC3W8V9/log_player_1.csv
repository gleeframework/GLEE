Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the fact that others might be interested, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:** Even though Bob's perceived value is $8,000, there might be some wiggle room depending on his need for the product. This strategy aims to test that upper limit."
