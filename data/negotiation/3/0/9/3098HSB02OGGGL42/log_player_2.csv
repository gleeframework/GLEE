"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $140 is close to your maximum, but you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. 
* There are 10 rounds, so you have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My goal is to save as much money as possible.
*  $130 is a reasonable starting point for my counteroffer, as it's still above Alice's minimum value of $100.
*  It's also a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* I have 9 rounds left, giving us both room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise.
* I've already made a counteroffer and was rejected.  Further negotiation could take more time and may not result in a better price.
*  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will just lead to smaller price reductions and consume precious rounds.
* I can save $15 compared to buying from John."
