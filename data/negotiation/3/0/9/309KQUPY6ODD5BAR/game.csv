"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply not feasible. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. How about $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a touch high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,250 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to $8,000.  Let's try $7,750.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to benefit from the deal.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and so am I. How about $7,500? That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $7,600 to make this deal work for me.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",7600.0,Alice,7,
