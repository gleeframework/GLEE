"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I have to consider the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $18000 is still above my budget, and I'm not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to pay $16000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll counter with $9500. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
