Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're providing. I would like to propose a price of $13500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a little closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $13,750.  This would still give you a significant value for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me propose $13600 as my offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the full $14,000 I was hoping for, it's still a good deal, and I'm getting closer to my desired price.  There's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer, and then I might have to settle for the $10,000 from John."
