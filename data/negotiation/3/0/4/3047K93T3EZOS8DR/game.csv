"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach a fair agreement. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Would you consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still trying to figure out a way to make this work for both of us. $9,750 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,500.  Would you consider $10,000?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to move forward. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I don't think I can go any higher. This is my final offer. Can you meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
