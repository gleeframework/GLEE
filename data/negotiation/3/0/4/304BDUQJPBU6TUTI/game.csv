"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $100 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I am willing to consider your offer of $85 for the product. However, I must also consider my own valuation and costs. Therefore, I propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's worth.",90.0,Alice,3,
