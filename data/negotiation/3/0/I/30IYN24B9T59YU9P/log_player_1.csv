I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. While $80 is better than $60, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to sell to John for $150 yet, as I'm hopeful I can get more from Bob."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer for $90.  While I'd like to get more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm running the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for $150.  $90 is a good deal, and it's important to recognize when to take a profit."
