"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, and even if she doesn't, you can always buy from John for your target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still slightly above my maximum budget.  While it's a good deal compared to her initial offer, I can still save money by rejecting this offer and seeing if I can negotiate further. There's a chance she might be willing to come down even more, and if not, I can always buy from John for $8,000."
