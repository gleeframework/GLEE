"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8000.0,Bob,4,
