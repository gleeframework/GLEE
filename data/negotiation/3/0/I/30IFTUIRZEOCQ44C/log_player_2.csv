"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's more than fair.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let's discuss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's value to her ($1,000,000).
* While her offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much, potentially leading to a lower counter-offer. 
* You have the fallback option of buying from John at $1,200,000, so you're not at risk of losing the product entirely."
