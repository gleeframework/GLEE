{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $800,000. This is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it for even less. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm going to start by making a fairly aggressive counteroffer. I'm going to offer $600,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget. I'm hoping that she'll see that I'm serious about buying the product and will be willing to negotiate."

Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get her down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $650,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to meet her halfway. I'm hoping this will be enough to get her to accept the deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still above my ideal price, but I'm seeing some progress. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a good middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm going to offer $700,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, and it's closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping she'll accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is sticking to her price, and I'm running out of time. I've already made several counteroffers, and while I'd prefer a lower price, $725,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John.  I'll accept her offer."
