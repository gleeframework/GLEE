"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a fantastic opportunity to own a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $12000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $10500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price that still gives me a decent profit, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
