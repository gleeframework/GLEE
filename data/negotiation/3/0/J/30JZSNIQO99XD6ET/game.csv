"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1100000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $1250000? This would still leave you with a good deal while ensuring I can fairly compensate for the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1200000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while you get a solid price for your product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
