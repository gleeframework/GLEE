"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in the product, $18,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $15,000 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product, as I believe it's a reasonable price that reflects both our needs.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $15,000. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount. My revised offer is $14,500 for the product. This is the closest I can get to meeting your budget while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,500 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to bridge the gap further.  I'll offer $13,500, which is my absolute final offer. I believe it's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. If we can't reach an agreement on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",13500.0,Bob,6,
