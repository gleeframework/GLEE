Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum desired price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and see if I can reach a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm always keeping John in mind as a backup buyer at $120, ensuring I won't lose out on a decent profit."

While $125 is a decent price and better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I will counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident in the value of the product and don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
