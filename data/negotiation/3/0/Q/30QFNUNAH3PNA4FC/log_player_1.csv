"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $1,050,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  It's worth exploring further negotiations with him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,050,000 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,250,000.  This price still provides you with a good value, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle on $1,150,000? It seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
