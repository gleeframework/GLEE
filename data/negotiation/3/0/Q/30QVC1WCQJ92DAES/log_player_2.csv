"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment. However, I do have other interested buyers, and this offer stands for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering.  It makes no sense to accept her offer."
