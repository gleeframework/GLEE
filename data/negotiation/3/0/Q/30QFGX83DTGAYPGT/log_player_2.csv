"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  A counteroffer of $105 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable range, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** Offering $105 leaves some space for Alice to counter without feeling like she's being pressured too hard.  
* **Positivity:**  The message is polite and maintains a positive tone, which can help keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price point,  there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue haggling and potentially get an even better deal.  You might be able to convince Alice to drop her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $105. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet Alice halfway, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Specific number:**  Offering a specific price ($107.50) creates a sense of concreteness and shows a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains polite and emphasizes the benefit of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107.50 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's try $109. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:**  $109 is very close to your ideal price of $105. While you might prefer to push for a lower price, there's a good chance that further negotiation won't yield a significant difference.
* **Time constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's important to consider the potential cost of continuing to negotiate. If you don't reach an agreement soon, you'll have to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer, leaving you with less time and potentially a higher final price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal within your budget."
