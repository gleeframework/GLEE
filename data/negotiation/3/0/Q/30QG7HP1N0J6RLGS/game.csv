"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $140? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle on this.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle again at $155.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",155.0,Bob,4,
