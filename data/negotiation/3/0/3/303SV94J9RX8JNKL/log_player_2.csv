"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate while still staying well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further. $125 is still a significant markup from her $100 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $110 might be a bit low. How about $118? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 118
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential deal. By offering $118, we're showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but also holding our ground on getting a good price."
