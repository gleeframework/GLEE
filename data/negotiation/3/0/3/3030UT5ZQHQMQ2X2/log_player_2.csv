"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's always worth exploring negotiation first. Since you're willing to pay up to $150, a starting price of $120 is reasonable. Let's see if we can get it lower!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  $100 is a significant discount from her initial offer and still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

$110 is a good price, and I'm comfortable with it.  It's a good compromise and saves me $40 compared to John's offer."
