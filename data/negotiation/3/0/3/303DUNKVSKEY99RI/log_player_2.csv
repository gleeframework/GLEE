"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $120 by you, and I believe it's worth every penny. My initial offer is $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you're aiming to save as much money as possible. Since you're willing to pay $120, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal at this point.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, achieving your goal of saving money."
