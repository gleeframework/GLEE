It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:** $12,000 is a significant profit over your $8,000 minimum and a solid return.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob is firmly anchored at $12,000.  Further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation out risks losing Bob altogether. Accepting now secures the deal."
