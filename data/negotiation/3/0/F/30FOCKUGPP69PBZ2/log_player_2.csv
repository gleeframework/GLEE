"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You are willing to pay no more than $150, and Alice is asking for $120.  
* **Potential for a better price:**  It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  I've lowered the price by $20, which is a significant reduction. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also sets a clear expectation.
* **Be polite:**  Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $100 is still a bit above Alice's minimum, leaving space for her to counter if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $100 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $110 is less than your maximum of $150.
* **The price is good for both parties:** Alice is willing to come down from $120, and you're able to get a lower price than her initial offer. 
* **Continuing to negotiate may not be worth it:**  With only 7 rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price without risking losing the deal."
