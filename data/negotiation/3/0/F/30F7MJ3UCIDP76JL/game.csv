"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work for me. How about $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do better than $110, but I need to make a profit. How about $130? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $120.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $135? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",135.0,Alice,5,
