"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob (""great deal"") and building a positive tone.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"". 

This approach allows me to start strong while keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob a reason to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While selling to John guarantees $150, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm giving a reason for my price by mentioning the product's value.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to potentially counter-offer again.

This strategy balances my desire to earn as much as possible with the need to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. If I reject, I can counter-offer again and try to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a Safeguard:**  While John's offer guarantees $150, I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price from Bob.

This strategy maintains the possibility of a more profitable deal with Bob while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm not able to go as low as $130, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can offer right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm narrowing the gap between our positions by offering a price closer to Bob's.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise to emphasize fairness and encourage acceptance.
* **Limited Room for Further Reduction:**  I'm signaling that there's limited room for further price reductions, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

This strategy keeps the negotiation progressing and increases the likelihood of a successful deal while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'd be willing to meet you at $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $125 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that may ultimately result in a lower price.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of getting a lower price or failing to reach an agreement outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal."
