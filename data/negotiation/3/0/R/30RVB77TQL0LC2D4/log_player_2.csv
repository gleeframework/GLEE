"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, you're aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to go down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $110? That's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $150 and he wants to save as much money as possible.  Accepting the offer ensures a purchase and saves Bob $40 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice rejecting future offers or Bob running out of rounds."
