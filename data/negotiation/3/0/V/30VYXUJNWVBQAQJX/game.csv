"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $105.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but I'm not quite there yet at $110.  Let's try $108. It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about $109?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can close the deal at that price.",109.0,Alice,5,
