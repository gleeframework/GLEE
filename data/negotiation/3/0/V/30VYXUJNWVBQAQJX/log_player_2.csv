"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $115. It's a good starting point, but you can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and see if you can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $105.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter again and try to get even closer to your $105 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but I'm not quite there yet at $110.  Let's try $108. It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about $109?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can close the deal at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:**  $109 is only $4 above your ideal price of $105. 
* **Time is running out:** You've already had 4 rounds of negotiation, and you only have 6 rounds remaining.  Continuing to negotiate risks you reaching the 10-round limit and having to buy from John at $120.
* **Potential for future savings:**  Even though you're not getting your ideal price, you've managed to bring the price down significantly from Alice's initial $115 offer.

By accepting this offer, you secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product entirely."
