"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product would be valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budget constraints.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could potentially justify going up to $700,000 if we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
