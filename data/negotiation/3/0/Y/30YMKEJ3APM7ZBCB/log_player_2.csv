"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product would be valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counteroffer accomplishes a few things:

* **Polite and Professional:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and maintains a good negotiating tone.
* **Signals Budget:** By starting significantly lower, it signals to Alice that her initial price is way off the mark and that Bob is serious about a lower price point.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** It gives ample space for Alice to counter and for both parties to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budget constraints.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved her price down, it's still significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could potentially justify going up to $700,000 if we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Acknowledges Progress:** It recognizes Alice's willingness to negotiate by lowering her price.
* **Incremental Increase:**  The counteroffer doesn't jump too high from the previous offer, showing a willingness to move but within reason.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding a time constraint (""close the deal quickly"") might encourage Alice to make a decision sooner rather than later.
* **Still Below Budget:**  Importantly, the offer remains significantly below your $800,000 maximum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
