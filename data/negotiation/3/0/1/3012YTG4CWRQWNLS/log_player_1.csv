Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for both of us. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John open if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. 
* **John's Offer:** Keeping John's offer in mind, I'm not desperate to close with Bob immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a great price for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from the initial $1,000,000.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:** The message emphasizes the ""great price"" for Bob, which can make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintain a Margin:**  $950,000 is still a substantial profit for me, and it keeps me closer to my target value. 
* **Maintain Pressure:**  The message uses a question (""What do you say?"") to encourage a response and potentially move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $900,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price in the next round. 
* **John's Offer:** While John is offering $1,200,000,  it's important to note that it's not guaranteed.  Bob is a known buyer, and a deal with him is more concrete.

**Conclusion:** 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the best option. It secures a sale at a price that's close to my minimum and avoids the risk of a stalled negotiation or losing Bob as a buyer."
