"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this opportunity to you.  I'm offering the product at a premium price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential it holds. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price (""premium price,"" ""true value and potential"") makes it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone is collaborative, inviting Bob to share his thoughts and begin a dialogue. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** By starting high, we leave significant room to negotiate downwards while still staying above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,150,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still far below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a large gap to negotiate within. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price.
* **John as Backup:**  We have the security of John's offer, giving us leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its value to me. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a competitive offer considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but remain firm that it's too low. 
* **Significant Drop:** We decrease our asking price by $100,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  We reiterate the value proposition to justify the still-high price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This keeps us above John's offer while encouraging Bob to move closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $900,000 for the product. This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price for you considering your value and a good deal for me.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Gap Remains:** Bob increased his offer, which is positive. However, $900,000 is still significantly less than our $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Time for Leverage:** We have six rounds left, and it's crucial to leverage John's offer. Bob needs to understand we have other options.
* **Aiming Higher:** We've made substantial concessions, and now it's Bob's turn to make a more significant move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness and Transparency:** We're signaling that this is a serious offer and not open to much more negotiation. Introducing John's offer, without revealing the exact amount, adds leverage.
* **Finality:** By calling it our ""final offer,"" we create urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Price:** $975,000 is a strong compromise, still significantly above Bob's offer but leaving us a comfortable margin. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are past the halfway point of the negotiations; conveying urgency is important."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $975,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's counter-offer shows minimal movement from his previous position.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Strong Position:** We've negotiated strategically and given Bob ample opportunity to meet our price. We're walking away from the table with a very good deal. 

**It's time to capitalize on John's offer and secure the maximum profit.**"
