"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($80) but significantly lower than what it's worth to me ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Emphasize value:**  I mention that it's a ""great deal for both of us"" to subtly emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation space:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price. I believe I can convince Bob to pay more. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to work with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  
* **John's offer as backup:**  Having John's offer of $120 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This still gives you a great price, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I highlight the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and create a win-win scenario.
* **Urgency:**  I use the phrase ""Let's close this deal!"" to add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While $105 is still below my ideal price, it's a reasonable starting point for this round. The goal is to move closer to $120 while keeping Bob engaged. 
* **Understanding Bob's motivations:** I need to gauge if Bob is truly willing to walk away at $95 or if he's just trying to lowball me. His response will shape my next strategy."
