"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the unique nature of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit on this unique product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm still looking to keep the cost around $120 if possible. Could we possibly agree on $130 for the product? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still valuing the unique item you're offering.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going as high as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $132.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I still need to make a profit on this unique product. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $132.50, but I'm still concerned about staying within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $130? This would allow us both to reach an agreement that respects our respective positions.",130.0,Bob,6,
