"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get it for less. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $8,750 is a good deal for Bob.  It's still below his maximum budget and leaves room for a potential profit if he resells it. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly lower price, so accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
