"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is lower than your maximum budget, there's a chance you could get a better price.  You can try to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower the price after a rejection. You'll always have John's offer of $150 as a fallback."
