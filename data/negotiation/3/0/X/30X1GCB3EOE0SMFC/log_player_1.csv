"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation and still leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and get a sense of his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price in the next round.  I want to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where we can reach a deal.  I'm confident I can get more than $15,000, and this counteroffer is a step in that direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. Although I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is a further compromise, but still leaves some room for profit. I want to see if Bob is serious about getting a deal and if he's willing to meet me halfway.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is a good deal. It's above my minimum price and I'm starting to run out of time. I'd rather not risk selling to John for less, so I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
