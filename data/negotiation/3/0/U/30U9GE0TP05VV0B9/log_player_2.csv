"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth exactly that to you.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.  Alice is offering it for exactly that amount. While it's a fair price for you, it doesn't offer any savings. Since you have the option to buy from John for the same price, you might as well reject Alice's offer and keep your options open. There's a chance John might be willing to negotiate down the line."
