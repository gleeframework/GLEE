"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Could you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
