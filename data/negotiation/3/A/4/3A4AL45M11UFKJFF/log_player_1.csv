Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, securing a deal with Bob for even a bit less still results in a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,000 creates a sense of urgency (buying before others) and potential savings for Bob. This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for potential negotiation if he counter-offers. 
* **Alternative Guarantee:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have the security of selling to John at our minimum acceptable price."
