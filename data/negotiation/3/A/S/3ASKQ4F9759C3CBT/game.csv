"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $13,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you. Let me know what you think!",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my offer and coming down to $15,500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another offer. How about $14,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",14500.0,Bob,4,
