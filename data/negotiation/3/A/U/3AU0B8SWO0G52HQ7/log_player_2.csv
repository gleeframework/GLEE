"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe holds immense value for you. Given its worth to you is $12,000, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $11,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, as it represents a significant saving compared to its market value. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to facilitate this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($11,000) is less than your maximum budget ($12,000).** 
* **It's also less than buying from John ($12,000).**

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal. Accepting her current offer secures the product at the best price available."
