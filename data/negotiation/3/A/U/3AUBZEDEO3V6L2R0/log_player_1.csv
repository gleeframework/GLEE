"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but lower than what John is willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and positive message makes Bob feel valued and more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to close the deal, accepting his offer would be a substantial loss.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $175 to $160, showing flexibility. This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintain positive communication:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $140. Let's try to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to lose money on this deal, especially with John offering $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $140 is still a bit too low for me, but I want to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $150? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final offer, as it's my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing it as a fair solution for both of us. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:** Even though I'm not willing to go lower, I've made it clear that I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us."
