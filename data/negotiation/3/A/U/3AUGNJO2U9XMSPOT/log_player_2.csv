# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I have to make a profit, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** You're getting the product for $140, which is cheaper than John's $150 price.
* **You still save money compared to your maximum budget.**  Your maximum budget is $150, and you're paying $140, so you're saving $10."
