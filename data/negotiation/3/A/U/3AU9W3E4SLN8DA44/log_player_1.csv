Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum value of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're leaving room for potential negotiation and still leaving Bob with a profit.
* **It's a clear message:** You're stating your price and inviting Bob to respond. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent offer, it's still below your desired price and leaves less room for potential profit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go that high. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further. Accepting his offer of $105 ensures a sale and a profit that is significantly higher than what John is offering. It's important to balance potential gains with the risk of losing the sale altogether."
