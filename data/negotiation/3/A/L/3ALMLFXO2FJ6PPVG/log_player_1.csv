"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is a bold opening offer, but since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $950,000 is too low, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above the $1,000,000 floor I've set for myself. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of slowly working towards the $1,000,000 mark. This offer is a compromise, but it leaves room for further negotiation if needed. We're getting close to a deal, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in paying this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting very close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get $1,000,000 or more. It's worth risking another round to try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $1,000,000. It's my minimum acceptable price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the product's value to him. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finally close this deal."
