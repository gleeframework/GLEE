"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product.  I'm confident it holds immense value for you, and to kickstart our negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a ways away from what I can accept for this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,900,000, but that's still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate you coming up to $1,200,000. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is the highest I can go.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,300,000. I've tried to be flexible, but given the other offer on the table, I need to be realistic.  I'm willing to make one final concession and accept $1,450,000. This offer is only valid for 24 hours.  Let me know your decision.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
