"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than my value for the product and still leaves you with a substantial profit.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing your product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our values.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which still gives you a sizable profit. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, as I'm running out of time and I'm not sure I can keep this deal open much longer.  Think about it carefully.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
