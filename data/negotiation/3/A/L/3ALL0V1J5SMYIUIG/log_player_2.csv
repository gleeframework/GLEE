Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $10,200. That's the lowest I can go.

``` 

At this point, Alice is signaling that she's firm on her price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result. Accepting the $10,200 offer secures a savings of $1,800 compared to John's price."
