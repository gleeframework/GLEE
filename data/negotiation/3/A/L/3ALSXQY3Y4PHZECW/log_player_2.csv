"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal. Offering $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering Bob's willingness to pay up to $10,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting the offer saves Bob $800 compared to buying from John and is only $300 more than his initial counteroffer.  There's a chance Bob could get a lower price with further negotiation, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds makes accepting the offer the more pragmatic choice."
