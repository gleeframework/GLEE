Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.
