Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
