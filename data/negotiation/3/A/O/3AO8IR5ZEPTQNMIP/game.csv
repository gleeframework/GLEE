"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I agree this product could be very beneficial. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a significant investment for me. How about we settle around the middle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is still a great deal, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to move up slightly to $1,025,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us, given the value it provides.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is still a great deal, considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
