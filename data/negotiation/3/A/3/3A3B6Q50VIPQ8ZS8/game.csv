"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value to me and the opportunity for both of us to make a deal.  What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $14,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
