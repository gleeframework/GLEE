"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. This is a very competitive offer considering its true value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is still a bit too high. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting her initial offer and seeing if she's willing to come down to a price closer to $11,000.  You have John as a backup at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate."
