"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high.  It's significantly more than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worthwhile to try negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to discussing this."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value significantly exceeds that.  I could consider letting it go for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's closer, it's worth seeing if I can get her to come down further. I'll counter with a higher offer than my absolute maximum to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $13,000? This is a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
