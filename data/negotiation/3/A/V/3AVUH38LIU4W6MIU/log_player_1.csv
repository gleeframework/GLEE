Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get closer to that figure with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of time, and John is offering a guaranteed price that meets my minimum."
