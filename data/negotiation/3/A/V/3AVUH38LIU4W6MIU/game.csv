"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
