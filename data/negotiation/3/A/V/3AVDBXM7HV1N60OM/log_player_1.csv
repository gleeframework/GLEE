"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. My asking price is $120, which I believe is fair considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Show confidence:** My message is positive and expresses belief in the product's value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm clearly open to discussion by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also encouraging Bob to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my goal of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Focus on the value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, subtly pushing him towards accepting my offer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I keep the message friendly to avoid any animosity and maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $98? That's a good compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** $98 is very close to my desired price of $105 and only $2 away from my initial offer of $100. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely. 
* **Positive progress:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, and accepting this offer means I'll make a significant profit. 

While I'd love to push for a bit more, it's better to secure the deal now than risk losing Bob and ending up with John's lower offer."
