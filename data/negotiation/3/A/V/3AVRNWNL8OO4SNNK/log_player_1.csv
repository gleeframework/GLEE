{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  I'll keep John as a backup option, just in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $12,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, as it's above my minimum. However, I can still try to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $14,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
