"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $10,500. Would that be workable?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,500. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
