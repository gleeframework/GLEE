Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,000.  I know it's a valuable piece, and I think this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I provide a brief justification for the price to make it seem reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer based on his proposed price. 
* I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  I value the product at $12,000, and Bob's offer of $10,000 is below that.  
* **I have a better alternative:** I can sell the product to John for $12,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  I still have the option to negotiate further with Bob, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $12,000. 
* I'll be prepared to reject any offer below my minimum acceptable price and sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't produce a favorable outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my last offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Price:**  I reiterate that $11,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
* **Maintaining My Minimum:**  This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider whether to accept his next counteroffer, reject and make another counteroffer, or sell to John. 
* I'll continue to prioritize maximizing my profit while remaining aware of my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $10,500. Would that be workable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Close but No Cigar:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to justify selling the product below my minimum value.
* **Sell to John:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which is a better option than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price. If that fails, I will sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,500. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last chance to negotiate with Bob. This creates pressure and encourages him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer ($11,000), showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit.
* **Alternative Available:**  The message explicitly mentions that I have other buyers waiting, making it clear that I am not desperate for his deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price close to my desired value.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John for $12,000. I've reached the end of my negotiation with Bob and it's time to secure a sale."
