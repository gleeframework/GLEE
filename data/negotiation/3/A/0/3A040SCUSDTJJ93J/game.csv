"Alice, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only justify going as high as $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is lower than I anticipated, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still pushing my budget. I could consider going up to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $750,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $850,000? This would be a great opportunity for you, and it would also allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while respecting both of our budgets.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $775,000 is still significantly below what I need to move forward.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement.  I'm confident that this is a good deal for you, and I hope we can finalize it.",825000.0,Alice,7,
