"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept it, I will be paying $1,200,000, which is $300,000 more than what I am willing to pay. If I reject the offer, I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is still within my budget. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer.
