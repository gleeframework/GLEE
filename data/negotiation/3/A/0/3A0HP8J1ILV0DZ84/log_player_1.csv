Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic balance:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a large profit, but not pushing for the full value to Bob.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob a clear incentive to accept, as he'll still be getting a good deal.

By offering $1,200,000, you increase your chances of Bob accepting while still ensuring a substantial profit. If he rejects, you'll have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000."
