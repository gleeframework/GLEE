"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than you mentioned.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also takes into account your concerns about the price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'll offer you a revised price of $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $10000. I'll make a final offer of $10000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
