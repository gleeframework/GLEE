"Thanks for the offer Alice. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think the price is a bit high, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $950,000?  That's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
