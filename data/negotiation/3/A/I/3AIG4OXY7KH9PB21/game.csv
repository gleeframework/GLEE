"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I was initially asking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $14000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value it can bring to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000. If you're not able to come down to that, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
