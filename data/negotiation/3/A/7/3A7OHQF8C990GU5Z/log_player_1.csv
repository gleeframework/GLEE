Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and his own perceived value. It seems strategic.  I need to counter in a way that keeps him engaged but pushes the price higher.
