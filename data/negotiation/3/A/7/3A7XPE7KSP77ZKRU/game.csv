,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,500 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,500. This is a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product at that price.",9500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll be selling the product to someone else.",9250.0,Alice,7,
