"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
