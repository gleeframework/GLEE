"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $11,500 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope it's a reasonable price for you.",10500.0,Bob,4,
