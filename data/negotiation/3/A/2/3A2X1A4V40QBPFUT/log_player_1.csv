Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I believe it offers significant value at this price, and I'm keen to find it a good home. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a substantial markup from Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but it's still a ""deal"" compared to my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and eagerness, to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject $14,000. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $1,000."
