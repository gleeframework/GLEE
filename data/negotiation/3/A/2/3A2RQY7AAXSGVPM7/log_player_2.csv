"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while leaving room for a profitable partnership. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $700,000 if you're willing to negotiate further."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we seem to have different perspectives on the product's value.  I've adjusted my price significantly already, and to be frank,  $700,000  falls short of what I can accept. If you're serious about purchasing, I'm willing to consider  $1,500,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has come down significantly, but she's still way above your budget and seems firm on her ""final offer"". It's unlikely she'll go down to a price you're willing to pay.  You're better off taking John's offer and securing the product at your target price."
