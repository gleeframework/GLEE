"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The initial price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially close a deal quickly if he's highly motivated.
* **Below John's Offer:**  While starting high, the offer remains below John's guaranteed purchase price, providing a safety net.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" indicating your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own stated value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while leaving room for a profitable partnership."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Bob's Value:**  The counteroffer drastically reduces the price from the initial offer, showing flexibility. However, it remains intentionally above Bob's stated value to maintain a strong negotiating position. 
* **Still Below John's Offer:** The price remains below your guaranteed sale to John, preserving your safety net.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes partnership and finding a mutually profitable outcome, aiming to keep the negotiation collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $700,000 if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased only slightly, suggesting he's not making significant concessions.
* **Below Value:** The offer remains substantially below both his own perceived value and your minimum.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While John's offer is becoming more enticing, there's still time to explore if Bob is willing to move closer to a reasonable price. A firm rejection might prompt a more serious counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we seem to have different perspectives on the product's value.  I've adjusted my price significantly already, and to be frank,  $700,000  falls short of what I can accept. If you're serious about purchasing, I'm willing to consider  $1,500,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** The message establishes a firmer tone, indicating limited flexibility.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and emphasize the need for Bob to be realistic.
* **Meeting John's Price:**  You've now matched John's offer, signaling that you're prepared to walk away from the negotiation if Bob doesn't meet your minimum. 
* **Still Room for Acceptance:**  While firm, you leave the door slightly open by saying you're ""willing to consider"" the offer if Bob is ""serious."" This provides a small window for him to counter slightly above if he's highly motivated."
