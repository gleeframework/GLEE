Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You are aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $100 allows you to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that is significantly lower than his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $80 if Bob declines. This ensures you don't need to go below your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
