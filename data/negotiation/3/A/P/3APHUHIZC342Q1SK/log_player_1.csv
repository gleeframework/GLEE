Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **John's Value:**  John is willing to pay $1,000,000.
* **My Strategy:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'll aim for a price close to my value, but still appealing to Bob.  A price of $950,000 leaves room for Bob to make a profit ($50,000) while still getting a good deal.
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. This offer is calculated to entice Bob without risking a significant loss."
