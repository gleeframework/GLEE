Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) without pushing him away.
* **Knowing Your Bottom Line:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 (John), so any offer to Bob should be above that. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but not absurdly so (e.g., $1,499,999) leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, which could still land you a higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes value and exclusivity to make the offer more appealing."
