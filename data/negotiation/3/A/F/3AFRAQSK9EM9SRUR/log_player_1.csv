Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're ensuring you get more than your minimum desired value.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate but still leaves a profit margin for him.
* **It shows confidence:** This initial offer suggests you believe in the value of your product.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly less than what you were hoping for. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  You're still in a strong position because Bob is clearly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,350,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,400,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer on a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeps the deal alive:**  It's still a good price for Bob, making him more likely to continue negotiations.
* **Increases your profit:**  It moves closer to your desired price point without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am still not able to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose $1,375,000 as a compromise. This allows me to stay within my budget while still making a fair offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from your previous counteroffer and is getting close to your desired price.  At this point, it's likely that continued negotiation would take longer and might not result in a significantly better offer.  It's better to accept his offer and close the deal,  securing a good profit."
