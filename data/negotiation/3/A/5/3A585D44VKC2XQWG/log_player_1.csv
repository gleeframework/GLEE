{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice!  That price is a little steep for me, would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 might be a bit low.  Would you be willing to do $100 even? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is a good deal for me. It's more than my minimum of $80 and getting closer to my desired price. I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations or having to sell to John for less."
