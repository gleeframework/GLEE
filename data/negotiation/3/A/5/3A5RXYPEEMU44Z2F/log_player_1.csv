Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will pay $150 provides a strong fallback position, allowing Alice to confidently aim high with Bob.
* **Psychology:** Offering a slightly discounted price ($145) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob, increasing the likelihood of him accepting."
