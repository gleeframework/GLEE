Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, it's always good to aim higher initially. Bob might be willing to pay more than his estimated value, especially if you present the product well. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). However, without knowing Bob's negotiation tactics or how much he might be willing to overpay, it's best to start with a price that benefits you the most.

This strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit. If Bob accepts, you make a great sale. If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on your guaranteed sale to John at $150."
