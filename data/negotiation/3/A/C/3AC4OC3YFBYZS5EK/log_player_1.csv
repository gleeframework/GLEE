"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiations at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  I'm beginning significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""potential"" of the product, I aim to appeal to Bob's desire for a good investment, even if he sees its immediate value as lower.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While my initial offer is high, I'm aware that I have John as a guaranteed backup. This gives me the leverage to start strong and potentially secure a deal significantly higher than Bob's initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant jump from his perceived value, indicating strong interest. However, it's still below my minimum. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price but keeping it significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and avoid appearing overly eager to concede.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:**  This counteroffer will reveal how serious Bob is and whether he's willing to meet me closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming higher. Bob's consistently increasing his offers, showing he's invested in the negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can secure a more favorable deal.  I'm not overly concerned about time pressure yet, as I still have John as a guaranteed option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I've given this offer further thought, and to find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,850,000. I believe this price reflects its value while acknowledging your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between our previous positions, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Final Offer Tone:** By framing it as a result of ""further thought"" and a desire to ""find a middle ground,"" I'm subtly signaling this is my best offer, encouraging Bob to seriously consider it. 
* **Time Awareness:** While I'm not in a rush, I want to keep the negotiation moving. This offer keeps the door open for a deal with Bob while still leaving me with the option to turn to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. I think we're getting closer. Based on my budget and the value proposition, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** While slightly below my ideal target, $1,800,000 is a significant profit above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further haggling might only yield small incremental gains while risking Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital that I can put to use elsewhere. It's unlikely the additional rounds would justify the risk of losing Bob over a relatively small difference."
