"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer.  While I value our potential partnership, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This price still allows me some profit while recognizing the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and meeting me halfway. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for future collaboration. I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
