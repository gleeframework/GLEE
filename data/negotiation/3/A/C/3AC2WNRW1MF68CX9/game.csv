"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider.  To move this forward, how about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,900,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering both our valuations and would allow us to finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
