"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Can we discuss further?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm thinking of $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've compromised significantly, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $13000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this one last offer?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free warranty and a personalized setup service. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Can you consider this final offer?",14000.0,Alice,7,
