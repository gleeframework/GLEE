{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great opportunity for you, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling flexibility and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the potential benefit to Bob, making him think about the product's worth to him. 

This approach balances the need to get a good price with the importance of keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. There are 8 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a better price than Bob's initial offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher offers:** Bob's initial offer is my minimum. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher if I show firmness in my negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:** With multiple rounds left, I can explore different counteroffers and gauge Bob's true interest level.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and open the door for a potentially more favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a price in mind.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the value this product offers justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I show respect by acknowledging Bob's perspective and his offer.
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, subtly implying he might be undervaluing it.
* **Counteroffer with compromise:** I offer a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Emphasize fairness:**  The message focuses on a ""fair deal,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and mutual benefit.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maintaining my position and fostering continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,600,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's more room for negotiation, especially considering Bob's willingness to come up from $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher offers:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating he may be willing to go higher with a persuasive counteroffer.
* **Remaining rounds:** I still have 6 rounds left to explore further negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I continue to push for a price closer to my initial goal while maintaining a path to a successful negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're coming up in your offer, which shows you're serious about this. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go down to $1,650,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe this product is worth that value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's movement:** I emphasize Bob's willingness to negotiate, reinforcing the sense of progress.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 4 rounds left and believe I can secure a slightly better deal. I'm not eager to sell immediately, especially considering the potential for a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant difference:**  Bob's offer is only $50,000 higher than my minimum. There's a good chance he might be willing to go a little higher to secure the deal.
* **Remaining rounds:**  I have enough rounds left to explore further negotiations and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for my minimum if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and keep the negotiation open, hoping to squeeze out a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're hesitant.  However, I've already made significant compromises. I can't go lower than $1,575,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. It's a win-win for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's hesitation:**  Show understanding to build rapport and encourage continued negotiation.

* **Maximize potential profit:**  It aims to achieve a price slightly higher than your minimum while remaining attractive to Bob.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal. Can you consider $1525000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only two rounds left, the chances of getting a better deal from Bob are slim.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of a lower price:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer, there's a high risk that Bob will either reject my counteroffer or offer a price lower than my minimum in the final round.

It's a calculated risk to sell to John, but it minimizes the chance of losing money and ensures I receive a price that meets my minimum requirements."
