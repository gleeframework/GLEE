Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's more than your minimum of $8,000, but also significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation that could potentially get you closer to your ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is more than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer. It's a step closer to his perceived value, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
