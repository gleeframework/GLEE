Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's no harm in starting with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, we can adjust downwards. If he counters, we know he's serious and can negotiate from there.
* **Backup Plan:**  The key is we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This means we shouldn't accept anything less from Bob."
