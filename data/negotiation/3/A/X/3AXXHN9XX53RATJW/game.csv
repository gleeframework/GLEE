"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. This product is worth at least $1500000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to the right buyer. I'm confident this is an opportunity you won't want to miss.  My initial offer is $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1800000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the opportunity it presents.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1700000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1700000.  I'm willing to go down to $1850000, which is a substantial discount from my original offer.  This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal with you.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think about other options if we can't meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. However, $1600000 is a significant drop from my last proposal, and honestly, too low for me.  To bridge this gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1750000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our need to reach an agreement.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1750000 and $1600000, which is $1675000. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up this deal today.",1675000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your frustration, and I want to reach a deal as well. However, $1675000 is still too low for me. I am willing to come down to $1700000. This is a fair price given the value of the product and the potential it holds.  Let's close this deal and move forward. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1650000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm starting to get a bit tired of negotiating. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1650000.0,Bob,10,
