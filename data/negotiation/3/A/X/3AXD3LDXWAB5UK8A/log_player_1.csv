Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm looking to get $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately makes him walk away. I'm hoping to find a middle ground.  We'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. Can you meet me at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, $130 is still below it. I'm not willing to drop that low.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping we can reach a deal without having to go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference -  $135.  That way we both get a good deal and we can close this out."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $130, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting really close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking a deal falling apart.  I'll go ahead and sell to John.  He's guaranteed to pay my minimum price, and I can move on to other deals."
