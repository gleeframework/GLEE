"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1200000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go a bit higher than that. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1600000, so I'm offering $1400000. Can you consider that?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
