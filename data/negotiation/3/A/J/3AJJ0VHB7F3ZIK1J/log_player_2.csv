"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's offer. This establishes a lower baseline for negotiation and forces Alice to consider if she wants to continue negotiating. While Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000, starting lower puts pressure on Alice to make concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $820,000, which is only $20,000 over Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth accepting this offer as there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price, and continuing could lead to Alice becoming less flexible or Bob potentially losing the deal to John."
