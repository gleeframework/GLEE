"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to propose a compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we settle somewhere around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $13,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that price is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $11,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a price of $12,800, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the $1,300 difference from your last offer.",12800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy. How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,150?",12150.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you a price of $12,500, which is just $50 more than your last offer. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",12500.0,Alice,9,
