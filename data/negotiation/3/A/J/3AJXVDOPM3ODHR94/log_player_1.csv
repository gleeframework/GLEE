"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your desired profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price ($120).  You have room to negotiate and there's a chance to secure a better deal. Selling to John for $120 is a last resort if negotiations with Bob completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to come down to $150. This product is truly high-quality, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By lowering your price, you demonstrate to Bob that you're willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Justify the Price:** Briefly reiterating the product's value can help sway Bob towards accepting a higher price. 
* **Strategic Movement:** This counteroffer still keeps you above your minimum acceptable price but moves closer to Bob's range.  You're aiming for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $120. While you could try to negotiate for a bit more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale to Bob entirely."
