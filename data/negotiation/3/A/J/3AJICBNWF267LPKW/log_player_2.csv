"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $900,000.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to Bob's target price of $800,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away and Bob would then have to pay $800,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $25,000 compared to buying from John."
