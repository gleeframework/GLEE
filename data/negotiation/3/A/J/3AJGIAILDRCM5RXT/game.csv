,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90? It's a great deal for a product worth $100 to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go up to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $87.50 just doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $88.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my goal.",88.5,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $86? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stick to my budget.",86.0,Bob,6,
