"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, and $7,500 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,000.  That's my absolute maximum, and I'd be really disappointed if we couldn't reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll sell it to you for $8,250. This is as low as I can go.",8250.0,Alice,5,
