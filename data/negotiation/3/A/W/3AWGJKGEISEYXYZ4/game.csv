"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1050000 to make this work.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from your target. Can we meet at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $1000000. It's a fair price for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
