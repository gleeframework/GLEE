"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my usual asking price and still leaves you with a significant profit margin.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 simply isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,200 for this. If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to make a final concession. I can accept $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,7,
