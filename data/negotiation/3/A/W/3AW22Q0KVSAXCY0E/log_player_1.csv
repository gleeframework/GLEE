Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my usual asking price and still leaves you with a significant profit margin.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than his first offer, it's still significantly less than what I need to make.  I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 simply isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm hoping I can get closer to $10,500 in the next round.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,200 for this.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to make a final concession. I can accept $10,000 for the product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,950.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm close to a deal with Bob, it's getting very time-consuming and I'm running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to my price, and I don't want to risk losing out on the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
