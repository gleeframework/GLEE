Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $12000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'd like to propose $11000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
