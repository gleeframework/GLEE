"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which I believe holds immense value for you. My asking price is $2000000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1500000 is a respectable offer, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price still allows me to make a good profit while offering you a competitive deal. Let's work together to find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1375000. Can you consider this price?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1375000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1625000, which is a significant compromise.  I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1625000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1625000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1250000, which is my absolute maximum budget. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
