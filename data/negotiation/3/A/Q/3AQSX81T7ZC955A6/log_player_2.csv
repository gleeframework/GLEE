"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within the range that Alice might be willing to accept.  This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $8,000. Bob has already made a counteroffer, and he's likely to be able to get a lower price if he continues negotiating.  It's also worth noting that Bob can always buy from John for $8,000 if he doesn't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price while still leaving some room for negotiation.  He's emphasizing the value of the product to him and Alice's need to sell, which could help persuade her to accept a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at her minimum price, and Bob is unlikely to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's already rejected her previous offers, and his counteroffers have been rejected.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a worse deal, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $8,000.  This guarantees him the best price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
