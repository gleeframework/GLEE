"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $13000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  You have more rounds to negotiate, and you can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $12000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to your desired price, and you only have 6 rounds left.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price, and it's likely you won't be able to get significantly more in the remaining rounds."
