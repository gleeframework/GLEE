Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $110. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing that I can adjust it. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and I'm not comfortable going below my minimum.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John, so I'll sell to him."
