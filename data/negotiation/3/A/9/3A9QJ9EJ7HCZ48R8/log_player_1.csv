Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product will bring to my business.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what I would get from John.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially since I'm already at my minimum acceptable price."
