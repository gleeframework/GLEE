"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
