"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference – I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again – how about $1,075,000? This price reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that.  How about we settle at $1,060,000 and call it a deal?",1060000.0,Bob,6,
