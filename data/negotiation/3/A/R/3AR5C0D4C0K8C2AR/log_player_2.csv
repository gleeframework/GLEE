"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $800000 to you, and it represents a significant investment for me. After careful consideration, I propose that we engage in a transaction where you would purchase this product for $1200000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its intrinsic value and my asking price, aiming to satisfy both our interests. I believe this offer presents an excellent chance for you to secure a valuable asset while also allowing me to recover a substantial portion of my investment. I look forward to discussing this further with you.
