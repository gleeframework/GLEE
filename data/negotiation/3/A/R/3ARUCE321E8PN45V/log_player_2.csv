"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price.  He can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  It's a risk, but it could potentially save Bob a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $1,200,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it, but also tests the waters to see how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer means Bob saves $400,000 compared to buying from John. While there is always a chance Alice might come down further, the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings. It's more likely that Alice will not budge further, and Bob could end up with the product for a higher price or even lose the deal altogether."
