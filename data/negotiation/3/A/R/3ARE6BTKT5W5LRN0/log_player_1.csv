{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Positive and enthusiastic message:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher final price.

I'll be ready to assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not immediately accepting Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob clearly sees value in the product, evidenced by his willingness to pay at least $12,000. This suggests there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I haven't been given any information about time constraints.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore other options and possibly get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer closer to my initial price point, aiming to reach a compromise that satisfies both parties. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000.  This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $15,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows willingness to compromise while still earning a decent profit. 
* **Positive Message:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the value of the product, aiming to maintain a friendly tone throughout the negotiation. 
* **Call to Action:** I explicitly suggest a compromise and encourage Bob to reach an agreement. This keeps the conversation moving forward.

I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $15000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12000. If you're not able to accept that, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This situation presents a crossroads. Bob is firm on his $12,000 offer, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price.  I have three options:

1. **Accept Bob's Offer:** This would secure a sale at my minimum, but I would be leaving money on the table.
2. **Reject Bob's Offer and Counteroffer:** This risks a deadlock, potentially leading to a loss of the deal and the need to find another buyer.
3. **Sell to John:** This is the most secure option. John is guaranteed to purchase at my minimum price of $12,000, providing a definite sale and guaranteeing my minimum desired profit.

**Decision:**

Given the current situation, I'm choosing to **Sell to John** to guarantee a sale at my minimum price point. While I'd prefer a higher price, securing the deal is more important than potentially wasting time on further negotiations with Bob."
