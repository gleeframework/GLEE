"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering me. However, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, which I think is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $160. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $140, which is a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",150.0,Alice,5,
