"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the possibility of working together. Our initial offer for the product is $1000000. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above your desired price point of $800,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a more favorable price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to work with us. However, we're not quite ready to accept $850000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. We believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering its value to you and the benefits it can bring to your business.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $875,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. This offer represents a significant step toward a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand that you're looking for a fair price, and we're willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, we're not quite ready to accept $875000. We're willing to make another concession and offer $920000 for the product. We believe this is a reasonable compromise considering its value to you and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much and keeps offering prices above my budget. The deal is taking longer than I anticipated, and it's starting to feel like I might be stuck in a negotiation loop.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees I get the product within my price range and saves me further negotiation time."
