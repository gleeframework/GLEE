**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's price:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $950,000, you are getting the product for less than its value to you ($1,200,000). This means you can potentially resell it or use it in a way that generates more value. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money and still acquire the product."
