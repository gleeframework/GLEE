"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While I value your perspective, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to walk away happy with the outcome. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
