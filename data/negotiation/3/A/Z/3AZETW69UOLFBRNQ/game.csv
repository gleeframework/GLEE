"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $200 is far too high for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 represents its true value, I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $160? ",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. It's the absolute most I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm confident this product is worth more than your offer, but I'd like to find a solution. If I lower the price to $130, would that be acceptable?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $130 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it, or we can continue discussing.",100.0,Bob,6,
