"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the market, I'd be willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer. There are still 8 rounds left to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the current market.  Let's meet in the middle at $850000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good compromise and allows me to make a profit while also ensuring the sale.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing out on the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
