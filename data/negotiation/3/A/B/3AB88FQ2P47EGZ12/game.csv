,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the market, I'd be willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the current market.  Let's meet in the middle at $850000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",850000.0,Bob,4,
