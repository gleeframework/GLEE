I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get more than my minimum price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject it.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $9,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me, closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price, but I'm going to sell to John. There's no further room for negotiation, and John is a sure thing. I'm willing to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
