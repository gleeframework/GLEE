Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a strong offer that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000). It leaves room for negotiation but still secures you a good profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slight discount from John's offer, might be preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale."
