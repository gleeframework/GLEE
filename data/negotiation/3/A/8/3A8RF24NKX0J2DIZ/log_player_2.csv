Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  how about $130?  It's still a great price for a product you'll love!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $100 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go up to $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
Explanation:  Alice is very unlikely to go below $120. It's better to secure the product at the known $100 price from John rather than risk getting stuck with no deal and having to settle for a higher price later."
