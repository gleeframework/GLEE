"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by emphasizing the value of the product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I do appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  how about $130?  It's still a great price for a product you'll love! "", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for some negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product again to reiterate its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $100 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go up to $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob, trying to inch closer to my desired price point.  I'm still offering a discount, but it's a smaller one, showing I'm willing to be flexible but also holding firm on my expectations."
