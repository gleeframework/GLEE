Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a win-win scenario. The offer is above Bob's value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I secure a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal, his offer doesn't even cover my minimum value for the product.  I'll counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while remaining above my minimum value."
