"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your asking price. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1150000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to consider the value the product holds for me, and I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1225000. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I appreciate the effort to find common ground, I still feel that my budget is best served by a lower price. I am proposing a counteroffer of $1175000. I hope this figure will be more suitable for discussion.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not sure how much longer I can negotiate on this price, so I'm making a firm offer at $1200000. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
