Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a midpoint between my minimum price ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible without risking him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which might result in a lower price or selling to John for $80."
