"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This price gives Bob room to negotiate, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly less than my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not desperate to sell at his price. I believe this price is fair, considering the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough one! While I would love to get more than $1,200,000, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value. Given that I can get the same from John, there's no reason to risk further negotiation and potential rejection, especially since I have limited rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a secure sale at my minimum, and I can always try to negotiate higher with another buyer in the future."
