Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $100.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Finding a middle ground:** While you value the product at $120 and Bob values it at $80, aiming for a price of $100 potentially creates a win-win situation. 
* **Limited-time offer:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Backup plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below your minimum."
