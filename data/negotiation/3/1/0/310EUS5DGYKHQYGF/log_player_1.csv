Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11000 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10750. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. At this point, I'm not confident I can reach a better deal with Bob, and I'm running out of rounds. It's safer to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
