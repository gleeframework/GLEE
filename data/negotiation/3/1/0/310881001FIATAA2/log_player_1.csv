Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value for Bob can make him more inclined to consider the offer.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's still a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has expressed interest and is willing to pay more than his initial value. There's room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a strong fallback:** Selling to John guarantees a good profit. However, I'm willing to try and get a better price from Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Value Again:**  I reiterate the value Bob will receive from the product to encourage him to consider the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive tone (""appreciate your interest,"" ""fair price"") keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12500. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $12,500 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has indicated this is his maximum, so further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks losing the deal entirely, as he may walk away.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing the negotiation could drag on and potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or a loss of interest.

While I'd prefer $15,000,  accepting Bob's offer secures a sale close to my minimum and minimizes the risk of losing a deal."
