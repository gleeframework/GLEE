"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, hinting at the potential profit he can make.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer gives Bob an incentive to counter and allows us to work towards a mutually beneficial price. 

**Next Steps:**

*  If Bob accepts: I've secured a great deal!
* If Bob rejects:  I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind the 10-round limit and the potential of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Not My Minimum:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Selling to John would be a better outcome at this point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** However,  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  He's clearly interested, and his offer shows he's willing to come closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and close the gap.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point, aiming to reach an agreement with Bob before the 10-round limit expires."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,075,000?  I think that's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes that this price is a win-win situation for both parties.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, which ensures I'm not losing out on too much profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a decent deal.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.  I'm starting to run out of rounds, so I'll need to be strategic."
