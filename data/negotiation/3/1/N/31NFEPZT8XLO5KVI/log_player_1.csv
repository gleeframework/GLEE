"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to compromise a little and offer $9,000.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm going to go down to $8,800.  This is very close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm getting close to my minimum and Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  It's better to accept his offer and close the deal, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
