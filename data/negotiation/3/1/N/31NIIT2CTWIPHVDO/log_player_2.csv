"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows his serious intent to negotiate but also demonstrates that he's willing to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:** $8,500 is halfway between Alice's ideal price ($8,000) and Bob's maximum budget ($12,000).  This gives Alice some room to counter, but still keeps the negotiation moving towards a deal.
* **Message:**  The message is polite and conveys Bob's genuine interest in the product while being clear about his financial limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $9,250. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** While Alice has come down in price, the $9,250 offer is still above Bob's ideal price.  He's not desperate and can continue to negotiate for a lower price.
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still room for Alice to lower the price without significantly hurting her profit margin.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.
* **Goal:**  Bob's goal is to get the price as close to his maximum budget ($12,000) as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway between their last offer and his counteroffer.  This signals a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Reasonable Price:**  $9,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a decent profit margin for Alice.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits of a deal for both parties, increasing the chances of Alice accepting."
