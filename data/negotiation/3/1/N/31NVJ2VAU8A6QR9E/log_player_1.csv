"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but not outrageously so. This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and highlighting the value of the product to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The price is not my absolute bottom line, giving space for counteroffers.

**Important Note:** While I'm aiming for the highest price, I'm aware of my own minimum ($1,500,000) and the potential of selling to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially push for a higher price in subsequent rounds.  
* **The ""Sell to John"" option is always available:** This gives me a strong fallback option if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but it reflects my desire to work with you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:**  The tone remains positive and constructive, encouraging continued negotiation.
* **Strategic positioning:**  This price point allows for more potential negotiation rounds without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While Bob has stated his maximum, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **""Sell to John"" is a safe option:** This option remains viable, providing a guaranteed outcome if the negotiation with Bob fails.
* **Strategic maneuvering:**  By rejecting the offer, I can potentially push Bob closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. To be honest, I'm surprised you're not willing to go a little higher considering how valuable this is. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. If you're truly interested, let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair counter:** I'm making a counteroffer that is only slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing flexibility but also maintaining my minimum price.
* **Adding pressure:** I'm subtly adding pressure by expressing surprise at Bob's low offer and hinting at potentially ending the negotiation if he doesn't budge.
* **Finality:** By stating it's my ""absolute bottom line"", I'm signaling that this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Balancing act:** This counteroffer strikes a balance between pushing for a higher price and maintaining a realistic chance of securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, but I'll throw in a $20,000 bonus if you accept the offer. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,300,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, even with the bonus.
* **Negotiation is at a standstill:** Bob has stated his final offer, and there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Time is running out:** We are halfway through the negotiation rounds.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids risking further negotiation rounds that may not yield a better outcome. 

While I would prefer to earn more, selling to John provides a secure solution and ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
