Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit for you. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, aiming for the maximum profit immediately might make Bob less willing to negotiate or accept the offer. This approach balances profit with the likelihood of a successful sale."
