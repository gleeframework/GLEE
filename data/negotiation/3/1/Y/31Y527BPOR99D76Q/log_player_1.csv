""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows us to potentially maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,500 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), but it's close enough to our minimum that it might entice him if he's particularly interested in the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation if Bob counters. We can always go down slightly, but we never want to go below our guaranteed sale price."
