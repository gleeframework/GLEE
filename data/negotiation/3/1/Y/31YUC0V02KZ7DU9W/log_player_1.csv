Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding your ""backup plan."" You *know* John will buy the product for $12,000. This means you have no incentive to accept any offer below that price from Bob.  Therefore, your best bet is to aim for a price slightly below Bob's perceived value to increase your chances of a quick sale.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,900. This is a great deal on a product I know you're interested in. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11900} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** Offering the product at $11,900 is just below Bob's $12,000 valuation. This gives him a small incentive to buy it from you, while still securing a profit for yourself.
* **Message:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the ""opportunity"" and describing the price as a ""great deal"". This helps nudge Bob towards accepting.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price.  You'll need to decide if you're willing to negotiate or walk away knowing you have John's offer."
