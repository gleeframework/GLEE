I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point.  I'm also being friendly and trying to emphasize the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm really hoping to get closer to $100 for it.  Would you be willing to go up to $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to get closer to $100, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm not sure how much more negotiating room I have, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $92.50."
