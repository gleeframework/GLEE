"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's potential impact for a business like yours.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
