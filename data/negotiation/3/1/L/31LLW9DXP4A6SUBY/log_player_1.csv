"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your business. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:**  My message exudes confidence in the product's value, aiming to subtly influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting price"" and ""proposing,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor high:**  Starting high can influence Bob's counteroffers to be higher than if I started low.
2. **Gather information:**  Bob's reaction to this initial price will reveal a lot about his potential willingness to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and my initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his offer is low, it confirms he's interested.  I'll counter in the next round, aiming to bring the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's potential impact for a business like yours."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Firm:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective to maintain a positive negotiation environment. However, I clearly state it's too low and reiterate my awareness of the product's value.
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** My counteroffer of $1,800,000 is a $200,000 drop from my initial price. This substantial reduction shows flexibility but keeps me well above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm continuing to subtly reinforce the product's benefits, hoping to gently steer Bob's perception of its worth.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Signal seriousness:** The significant price drop demonstrates I'm serious about negotiating a deal.
2. **Maintain a strong position:** By staying well above Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation anchored in a range favorable to me.
3. **Encourage a counter:**  This counteroffer prompts Bob to reveal more about his willingness to pay and move closer to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiation could stall. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
