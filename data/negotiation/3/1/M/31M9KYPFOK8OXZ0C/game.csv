"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $900,000 is a significant way off from what I'm looking for. Could you consider $1,300,000?  I'm confident this product will deliver exceptional value for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and what other sellers are offering. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
