"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It's not even close to your value for the product ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price or buy from John for your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my value for it."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $17,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $12,000. You can still try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John at your preferred price."
