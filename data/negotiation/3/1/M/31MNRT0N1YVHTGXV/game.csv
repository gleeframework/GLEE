"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially offering it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my value for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
