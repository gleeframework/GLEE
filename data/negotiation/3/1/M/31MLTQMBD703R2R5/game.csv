"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $105 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? ",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle again? Can you do $107.50?,107.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer! How about we compromise and go with $109?  That's only a dollar away from your last offer and gets us a bit closer to where I need to be.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $109. How about we try to get a bit closer to my original target of $105? Can you do $108?,108.0,Bob,6,
