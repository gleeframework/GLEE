Alice's starting price is fairly close to your maximum, but there's still room for negotiation to potentially save some money. Let's see if we can get it for a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $105, which is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's see if we can nudge her down a little further."

Alice seems to be negotiating in very small increments. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get a price significantly lower than $108.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation, especially since John offers a guaranteed price of $120."
