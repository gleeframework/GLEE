Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this item that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering the product at $180, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer with a price higher than $150, which is your minimum. 
* **Knowing Your Alternatives:** You know John will buy the product for $150, ensuring you won't make a loss. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in the negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, a slightly lower initial offer could increase the chances of a quick sale, especially if you want to avoid the negotiation process."
