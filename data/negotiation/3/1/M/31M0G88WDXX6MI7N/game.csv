"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to reflect your budget concerns, but this is my final offer.  This product has significant potential for you, and I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
