"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be open to considering that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate.  Could you consider $17,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference at $14,000?  That feels like a good compromise that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
