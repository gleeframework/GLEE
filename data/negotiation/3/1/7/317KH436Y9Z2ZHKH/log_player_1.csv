We're getting closer, but I still think we can get a better price from Bob.  We'll counter again in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While we could continue negotiating, $950,000 is a strong offer and significantly above our minimum. Accepting now ensures we close the deal and don't risk losing Bob over a relatively small difference in price."
