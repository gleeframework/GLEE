Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first before I list it publicly.  I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for Bob to feel like he's getting a special deal (""offering it to you first""). 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This offer allows Alice to see how interested Bob is. If he flat out rejects the offer, she knows he's likely not willing to go much higher than $8,000, and she can move on to John."
