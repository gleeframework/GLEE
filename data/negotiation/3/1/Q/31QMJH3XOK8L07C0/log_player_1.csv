Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than what John is willing to pay.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to consider a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and even lower than what John is willing to pay. It's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to pay a price that reflects the value of the product.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me a minimum acceptable profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
