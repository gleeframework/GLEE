I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and decide whether to lower my price or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $15,000. While it's closer to my minimum than his initial valuation, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $13,500. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation, showing my willingness to compromise. I hope this will incentivize Bob to accept, as it's a decent price for him and still profitable for me."
