"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob responds before deciding whether to engage further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to maximize my profit and selling to John for $12,000 is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $12,500. This is still above my minimum price of $12,000, and hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay. I want to keep the negotiations going, but also want to make sure I'm not selling at a huge loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price point.  While I'd ideally like to get more, it's better to take the offer now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale to John."
