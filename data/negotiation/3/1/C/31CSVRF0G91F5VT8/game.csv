"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for your business and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you. My initial offer is $900,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $650,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still significantly below the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits for your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $725,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $725,000 is still too far below the product's true value. To make a deal work, I'm proposing $775,000. This reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from this product, and it's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $775,000 is getting closer, but I need to stay within a certain range for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment and the offer of $750,000.  To bridge the gap and finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $760,000. This represents a significant investment for you and a fair price for me, considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal.",760000.0,Alice,7,
