"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $105. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $108, which is within your budget and a good deal considering you're willing to pay $120 for it. Accepting her offer saves you $12 compared to buying from John."
