Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** It's not a hardball opening, showing you're open to discussion. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can come to a better agreement. How about if I offer to purchase the product for $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired price point. It's better to see if you can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This would still leave you with a substantial profit margin. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer. I would like to stick to $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been firm on his $1,350,000 offer, and there's a risk of the negotiations dragging on.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,200,000, it's safer to sell to him now.  You can always try to negotiate with Bob again in the future if the opportunity arises."
