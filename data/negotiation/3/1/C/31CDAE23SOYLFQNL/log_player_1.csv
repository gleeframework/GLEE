Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too greedy could make Bob reject the offer. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  We're highlighting the product's exclusivity and value while positioning the price as an investment.
* **The Price:** $1,400,000 leaves a good profit margin for you while still being significantly below Bob's perceived value.  

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down slightly, but stand firm closer to $1,300,000.
* **Confidence:** Project confidence in your offer. Don't reveal your minimum price or desperation to sell. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have John as a backup, avoid using him as leverage. It weakens your position with Bob."
