"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $9,500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance package. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
