"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my absolute maximum. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $11750? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $11750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but I think that's a fair price. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $13500? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'd like to make a serious offer of $11000, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",11000.0,Bob,8,
