Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product even more than $1,200,000 and might be willing to pay a premium.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. However, setting the price too high could lead to Bob rejecting the offer outright.  It's a balancing act between ambition and realism."
