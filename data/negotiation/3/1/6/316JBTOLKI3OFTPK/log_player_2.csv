"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a unique item that I'm confident you'll find valuable, and I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, you can potentially save even more money by negotiating with Alice. You know the product is worth $800,000 to her, so there's room for a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still potential for further negotiation. You know the product is worth $800,000 to her, and Alice is clearly willing to compromise. Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure an even lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is a bit higher than your latest offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and is a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $1,050,000 is within your budget and a reasonable price.  It's likely that you won't be able to get her much lower, and further negotiation might risk her walking away or you losing the product to John."
