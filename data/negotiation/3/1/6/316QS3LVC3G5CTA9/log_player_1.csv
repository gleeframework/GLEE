I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  I'm aiming for the best possible outcome, and a higher price means a larger profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I've left some room for negotiation if Bob is interested but needs a lower price.
* **John as Safety Net:** I know I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob rejects my offer. This gives me confidence to ask for a higher price.

It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's the best strategy to maximize my earnings."
