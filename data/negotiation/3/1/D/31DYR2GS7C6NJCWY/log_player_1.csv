Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Higher than your minimum:** $11,500 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Lower than Bob's value:**  $11,500 is still lower than the product's value to Bob ($12,000), making it likely he'll accept the offer. 
* **Risk mitigation:**  While there's a chance Bob will reject the offer, you're still guaranteed to sell the product to John for $10,000 if that happens.

By offering a slightly higher price, you increase your chances of getting a better deal with Bob, but still have a backup plan if he declines."
