"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This still gives you a significant profit margin and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000? Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go a little lower but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000?  This way we both get a fair price.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to go down to $1,225,000? I'm getting close to my limit, but I really want to make this deal happen.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a compromise.  Let's try $1,250,000. This is a fair middle ground, and it's a price I'm willing to accept to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,8,
