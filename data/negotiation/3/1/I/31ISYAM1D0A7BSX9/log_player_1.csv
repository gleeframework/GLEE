Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest by his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I also have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I am hoping to get closer to my asking price of $20,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $17,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's more than what John is offering.  I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
