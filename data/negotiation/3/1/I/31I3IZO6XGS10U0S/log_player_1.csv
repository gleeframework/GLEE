{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I am willing to negotiate, but I still aim to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. While I can't accept $9,500, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500. Would you consider selling the product to me for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm happy Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer of $10,000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  Since John is willing to pay my full price, I will sell to him to maximize my profit."
