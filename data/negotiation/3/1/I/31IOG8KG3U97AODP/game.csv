"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's close the deal now.",850000.0,Alice,5,
