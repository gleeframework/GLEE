"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  While $1,200,000 is better than the $1,000,000 I'd get from John, I have 8 more rounds to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000, so I'm offering $1275000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

I'm still aiming for a higher price and I think I can get it. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  $1,275,000 is getting more reasonable.  To make this work, I'll need to come down to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer for now, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $1275000, but I think I can do better than $1300000. Can you meet me at $1275000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take the $1,275,000, I'm still aiming for a higher price, and we have a few more rounds left. I believe I can convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."

We've been through several rounds, and while Bob is willing to negotiate, it seems he's unlikely to go higher than $1,275,000. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. I'll sell to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale, and I still make a profit."
