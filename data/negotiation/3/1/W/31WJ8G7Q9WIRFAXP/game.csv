"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you and is a reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
