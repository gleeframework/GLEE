"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for a product worth significantly more to me. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1500000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting and matches the value I'd receive from John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can try to push for a better deal with Bob.  I'm not in a rush to sell, and I can leverage the threat of selling to John to push for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to settle for that price. The product is worth significantly more to me than that. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering the product for $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you will gain from it. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1600000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1450000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm tempted to take the $1,450,000 offer, it's still lower than what I could get from John. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price by counteroffering. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. It's a unique opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will deliver significant returns.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,550,000, but I believe this is the lowest I can go while still getting fair value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1550000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1400000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor price, but it's still not at a level I'm completely comfortable with. I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob might get stubborn and refuse to budge further.  At this point, it's safer to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  I'm willing to sacrifice some potential profit to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of a stalemate."
