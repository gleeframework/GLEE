"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm thinking closer to $500,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I have to say that $500,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'd like to counteroffer at $750,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's worth. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  To be honest, $750,000 is pushing it for me.  My absolute best offer is $700,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and understand that $700,000 is your absolute best offer. However, I have to consider my own minimum requirements. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $700,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $725,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,7,
