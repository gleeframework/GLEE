"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I have to say that $500,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'd like to counteroffer at $750,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty and understand that $700,000 is your absolute best offer. However, I have to consider my own minimum requirements. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $700,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $725,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between her offer and your absolute best is relatively small. Accepting avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
