{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you would be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic while clearly stating the price. This sets the tone for a positive negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a higher price to maximize my potential earnings. I am aware that I can always lower the price later if Bob counteroffers.  If Bob rejects, I can use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy. Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to accept $17000 for the product?  It's a good starting point for us to work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $17,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable accepting it right now.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** This demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to continue negotiating.
* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'll aim to bridge the gap and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer. $17,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial price. Would you consider $18,500?  I believe this is still a fair price for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Product Price:**  $18,500 represents a compromise.  It's lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum.  This shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to drop my price too quickly.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a compromise that is fair for both of us. By counteroffering with a price in the middle ground, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to meet me halfway and potentially seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but $18500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go up to $18000.  This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $18,000 is very close to my desired price point, and it's a fair compromise. While I might have hoped for a slightly higher price, accepting this offer will result in a quick sale and a good profit.  

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** This avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection.
* **Profit:** $18,000 is a good profit, especially since it's above my minimum value and leaves room for potential future earnings. 

**Conclusion:**

While it's tempting to try to squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting Bob's offer at this point ensures a successful deal and reduces the risk of a failed negotiation."
