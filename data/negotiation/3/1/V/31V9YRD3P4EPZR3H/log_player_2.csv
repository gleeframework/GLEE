{""product_price"": 400000}

Alice is still too high, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John."

Alice is not budging from her price. I've only got three rounds left and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's time to go with John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still within my budget and I'm not confident I can get a lower price from Alice."
