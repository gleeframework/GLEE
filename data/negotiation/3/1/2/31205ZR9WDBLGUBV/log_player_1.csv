Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your recommendation. I would like to counter with an offer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $110?  This is a great product, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I am willing to pay $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe $105 is a fair price for the product. I am willing to stick to this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob seem to be stalled. He's unwilling to budge further, and I'm running out of time.  It's better for me to sell to John for $120 than to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
