"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
