Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000) to leave some room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more for the product since it's worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to get the best price, I'm not willing to sell for less than what it's worth to me. I will counter-offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1180000} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below the minimum I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum.  It's also likely that we'll continue to go back and forth, and I risk getting a lower price or losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is also an option, but this is a quick and clean sale, and I'm happy with the price."
