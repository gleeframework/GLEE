Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1,000,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, and it's a fair price for me considering its value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?

Alice is meeting your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting or going to John, as you won't get a better deal."
