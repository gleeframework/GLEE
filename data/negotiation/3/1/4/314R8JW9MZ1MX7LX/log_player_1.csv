Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your fallback.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 to be made if you sell to Bob.

**Negotiation Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while still maximizing your gain.  You don't want to start too high and scare him off, but you also don't want to lowball yourself.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why this Offer?**

* **Strong Opening:** It's closer to Bob's perceived value than your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, but you're still securing a substantial profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value, making it clear you're not desperate to sell.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
