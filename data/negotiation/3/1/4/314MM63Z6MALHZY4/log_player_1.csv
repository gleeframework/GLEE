Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're essentially playing with ""house money"". This allows you to aim high with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000), you set an anchor in Bob's mind.  Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your minimum.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes exclusivity and value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price outweighs the risk of going straight to your backup buyer."
