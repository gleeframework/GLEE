"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm going to start high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us a lot of room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still high enough to encourage Bob to continue negotiations."
