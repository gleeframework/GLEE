Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Considering my budget, I can offer $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still above my budget. How about $12000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to acquire this unique product.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $13500 is closer to my budget, I can only go as high as $12500. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. It's the minimum price I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I can offer it to you for $13000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
