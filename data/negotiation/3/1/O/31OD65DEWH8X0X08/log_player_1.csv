"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm going to start high, aiming for a price that's closer to my value.  While Bob might balk at this price, it sets a strong starting point for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can use his counteroffer to gauge his seriousness and adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to his value, it's still significantly below what I need to get.  I'm going to try and get closer to my target price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,600,000. This is still a good amount above Bob's offer, but closer to his value.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal before having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I need to be more aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This is my last chance to try and close a deal with Bob. I'm dropping my price significantly, but I'm still confident that it's a fair value for both of us. If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm worried that he's just trying to stall or drive the price down even further. It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John and move on."
