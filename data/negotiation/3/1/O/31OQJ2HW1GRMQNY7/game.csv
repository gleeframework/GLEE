"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's make this happen!",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $960,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $965,000 as a final offer.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",965000.0,Alice,7,
