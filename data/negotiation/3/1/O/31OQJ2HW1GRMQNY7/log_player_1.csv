Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping for. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is getting closer, it's still a long way from my minimum price. I'll see if I can push for a better deal in the next round before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $960,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $960,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not yet ready to give up. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $960,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $965,000 as a final offer.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 965000}
