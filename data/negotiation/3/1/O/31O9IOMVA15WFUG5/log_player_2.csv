Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her first offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for a guaranteed $800,000."

Bob should buy from John. Alice is willing to go down to $1,025,000, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $800,000.  It's likely the negotiation will continue to go back and forth.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's target price, it's the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation."
