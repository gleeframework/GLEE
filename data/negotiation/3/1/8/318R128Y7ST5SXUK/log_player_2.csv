"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true market value. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident you'll find this offer highly attractive. Let's discuss the details and I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly using sales tactics to make the offer seem more appealing than it is. While she doesn't state the actual price in her message, her offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than your fallback option of buying from John for $1,200,000. 

By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
