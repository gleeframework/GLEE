"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value and framing the offer as a ""starting point"" implies flexibility without seeming desperate.
* **Open to Discussion:** Encouraging Bob's feedback keeps the negotiation moving forward and allows you to gauge his interest and potential counteroffers. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial ask.  You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table.  Rejecting Bob's offer signals that you believe the product is worth more, setting the stage for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and confirming your interest in the product.  While I recognize you see its value, $1,700,000 falls short of what I believe it's worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Interest:** You want to keep the negotiation moving positively and acknowledge Bob's engagement.
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, you reinforce your position that the price is warranted. 
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** Coming down $200,000 is a substantial move that demonstrates willingness to negotiate, but it's not a drastic drop. This keeps the price well above your minimum and leaves room for further adjustments in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $2,100,000, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a significant amount below your initial ask and what you can get from John. Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the negotiation. You have ample rounds left to try and close the gap further. By rejecting, you signal that you believe the product holds more value while keeping the door open for a more favorable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to negotiate shows you clearly see the value this product offers. To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm proposing $2,000,000. This price reflects a significant concession on my part while still recognizing the true worth of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  You want to continue acknowledging Bob's engagement in the negotiation to maintain a good atmosphere.
* **Justification:**  Framing your concession as recognizing the ""true worth"" reiterates the product's value without directly disagreeing with Bob's assessment.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down to $2,000,000 is a smaller step than previous rounds. This signals that you're reaching the higher end of your acceptable range. 
* **Encouraging a Deal:**  This offer might be tempting enough for Bob to accept, given it's a significant price reduction from your initial ask. However, if he rejects it, you still have room to negotiate further or consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me and the concessions you've made so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is persistently negotiating, but his offer of $1,800,000 is still considerably below your target and what John offers. While you've made concessions, it's important to hold firm for a higher amount.  You have four rounds left, giving you space to:

* **Gauge Bob's Limit:**  Rejecting might prompt Bob to reveal how much further he's willing to go.
* **Propose a Smaller Concession:** You could offer a smaller price reduction than in previous rounds, signaling your price floor.

You risk Bob walking away, but your guaranteed offer from John provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find a price that works for both of us. I've given this offer serious consideration, and to be completely transparent, $1,800,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,950,000.  This reflects the significant value this product offers and represents my absolute bottom line."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Finality:**  You're signaling to Bob that this is your best offer.  By being transparent about your limits, you aim to encourage a decision without completely walking away from the negotiation.
* **Small Concession:**  The smaller concession ($50,000) reinforces the message that you're close to your bottom line.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This price offers a compromise, meeting Bob closer to his last offer while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.

This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. If he rejects it, you may have to decide between accepting a lower offer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, and that's my final offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me and the concessions I've made so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,800,000 is his absolute limit.  While you could continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely you'll bridge the gap of $150,000 at this point. Accepting Bob's offer would net you $300,000 above your minimum, but you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  

In this scenario, it's more strategically sound to cut your losses and sell to John:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer guarantees you reach your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a stalemate and a lower final offer, leaving you with less than John is offering.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal with John now allows you to move forward and potentially pursue other opportunities."
