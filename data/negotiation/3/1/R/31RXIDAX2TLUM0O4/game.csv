"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $850000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us. This is my final offer before I consider other options. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go to $925000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering your value and my budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925000 is still not enough. I'm willing to come down to $975000, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm prepared to offer $950000 for the product.  This is my final offer before I explore other options.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
