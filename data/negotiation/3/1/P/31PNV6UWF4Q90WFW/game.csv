"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product, while still allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
