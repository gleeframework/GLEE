{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to me to make it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Room for counter-offers:** I'm not setting a hard price, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me leverage if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting it would be a major loss for me. 
* **Counter-offer potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's a possibility of finding a middle ground through a counter-offer. 
* **John as leverage:**  John's offer of $10,000 gives me a safety net. I can afford to be firm with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed alternative."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:**  I'm not going too far down from my initial offer, but I'm showing flexibility to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob of the potential savings.
* **Setting a clear price:**  I'm providing a specific counter-offer to avoid going back and forth on vague terms.
* **Optimistic tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $8,750 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. While it's closer than before, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile for me.
* **Potential for counter-offer:**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, which indicates he's interested. There's still a possibility of a mutually agreeable price through another counter-offer.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,750 is still a bit low for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and is a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm making a smaller concession than Bob's last offer, showing him I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum value of $10,000, but it shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Clear next step:** I'm presenting this as a potential final offer to encourage Bob to accept."
