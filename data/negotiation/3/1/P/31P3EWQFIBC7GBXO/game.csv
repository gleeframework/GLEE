"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,750 is still a bit low for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This represents a significant discount from my initial price and is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
