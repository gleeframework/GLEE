"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is too expensive at $170. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down on her price.  We can always buy from John for $120 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, but I am interested. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 maximum. It's a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $140 is closer to our range, it's still above our $120 limit. Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, so we'll continue the back-and-forth.  We'll try to edge closer to our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a deal!  This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($100) and her current price ($140). It keeps the negotiation moving and shows we're willing to compromise if she is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount and sell it to you for $130. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we're still holding strong.  We are only $10 away from our ideal price, and there's still room for negotiation. There's no rush to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to offer $115 to make this work.  That's a very fair price for this product."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're inching our offer up, demonstrating we're serious about buying but holding firm to get the best possible deal. This offer is a strong signal that we're reaching the upper limit of what we're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115. I'll offer it to you for $122.50. It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is a great deal! Alice has met us almost exactly in the middle. While we could try to haggle another $2.50 off, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  This price is well below her initial offer and only slightly above our absolute best-case scenario from John.  It's time to accept and secure the product."
