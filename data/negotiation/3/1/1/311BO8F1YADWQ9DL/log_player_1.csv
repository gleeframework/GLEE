{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $1,000,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate if he counter-offers.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond.

Remember, I'm playing the role of Alice, and my goal is to maximize my profits.  We'll see how Bob reacts and then adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is lower than our initial offer of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, we're still aiming for a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, we can make a counter-offer, potentially pushing the price closer to our desired range. It's risky because we might lose Bob completely, but the potential gain of a higher sale justifies the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a good price.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  We're meeting Bob halfway by coming down from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000.
* **Maintaining a profit:** This offer still allows us to make a profit while being more flexible. 
* **Staying firm:** While we're willing to negotiate, we're not giving away our product for a significant discount. 

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable price. Let's see how Bob responds to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,125,000 for your product. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is very close to our last offer of $1,150,000. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely. It's likely Bob won't budge much further, and we might end up with a worse deal.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale for $1,125,000, which is still a significant profit for us.  While it's not our ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation process."
