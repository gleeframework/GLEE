Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe its fair market value is around $20,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted rate of $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** By mentioning a ""fair market value"" of $20,000, Alice sets a high starting point for the negotiation. This makes the offer of $18,000 seem more appealing.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Telling Bob about another buyer (John) introduces a fear of missing out and encourages a quicker decision.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than John's $15,000 offer.

**Important Note:** Alice needs to balance her desire for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If she starts too high, Bob might not even consider it."
