"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price.  He'll aim to get closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, given your value for it. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a good price for Bob.  He is still saving money compared to buying from John ($1,500,000), and getting closer to his goal of saving as much as possible.  While there is still room for negotiation, accepting this offer is a smart move."
