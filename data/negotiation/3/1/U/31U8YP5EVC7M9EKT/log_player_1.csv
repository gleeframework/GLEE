``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're guaranteed to make more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is likely to be motivated to accept since he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, given your value for it. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below your ideal price. You have more leverage since Bob is clearly interested in the product.  Rejecting his offer allows you to potentially get closer to your target price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
