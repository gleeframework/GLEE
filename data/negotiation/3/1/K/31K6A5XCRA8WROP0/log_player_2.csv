It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** $680,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price.
* **Alice is Firm:** She's stated this is her final offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the 10-round limit.  Continuing to push for a lower price risks Alice walking away or us running out of time and being forced to buy from John."
