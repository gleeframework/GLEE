"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but the  $600,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a significant reduction and I believe a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  While I appreciate your willingness to move up, the value of this product is truly  substantial.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,400,000. This is my bottom line, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the unique nature of what I'm offering.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to make one final offer of $750,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
