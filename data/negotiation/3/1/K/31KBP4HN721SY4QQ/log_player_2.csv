"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $900000.  It's a steal considering its true value, and I know you'll find it highly beneficial.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at full value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's product is valuable, Bob can get it for $800,000 from John. Accepting Alice's offer at $900,000 would cost Bob an extra $100,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice to achieve Bob's goal."
