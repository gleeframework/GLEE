I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
