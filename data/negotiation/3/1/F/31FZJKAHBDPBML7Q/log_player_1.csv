I'm going to try to get a bit more from Bob.  $14,000 is a good starting point, but I think I can push for a higher price."

I'm going to stick to my guns and try to get closer to my initial offer. $14,000 is still a good price for Bob, and it's a fair compromise considering our back-and-forth."

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting lower. At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting an even lower offer from Bob."
