# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's always good to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have room to go lower before reaching your maximum price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

You can still do better than $1,100,000. Reject the offer and counter with a price closer to your initial offer to see if Alice will budge further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1080000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to finalizing the deal.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While you can still try to negotiate, the risk is that she might walk away and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the $1,080,000 offer is a good compromise."
