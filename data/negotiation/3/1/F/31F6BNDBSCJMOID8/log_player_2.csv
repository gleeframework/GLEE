"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still too high.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I believe the product is worth significantly more, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. At $900,000, you're still saving $100,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
