"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While it does sound interesting, $180 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $140?  I'm very interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
