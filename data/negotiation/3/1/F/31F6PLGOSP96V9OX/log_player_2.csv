"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but that price is cutting it too close for me. I can go down to $999,000 – it's my final offer. This is a great deal on a product you won't regret owning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000.

``` 

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price.  Since John is offering the product for $800,000, it's the most cost-effective option for Bob.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a further counteroffer, and Bob could end up paying more than he wants.  Buying from John guarantees the lowest price and a secure purchase within Bob's budget."
