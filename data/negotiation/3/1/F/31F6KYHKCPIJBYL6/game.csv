"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which reflects a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair compromise considering my financial constraints.  I'm confident this offer allows you to make a profitable sale while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank,  $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable accepting. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This offer reflects the product's true value and my willingness to find middle ground. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
