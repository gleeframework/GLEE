"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but your price is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is fair given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the product from John for $10,000, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product to me and your profit margin. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
