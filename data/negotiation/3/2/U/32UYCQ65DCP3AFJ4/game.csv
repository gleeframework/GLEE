"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I think $160 is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $160, which is $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $100.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",100.0,Bob,6,,
