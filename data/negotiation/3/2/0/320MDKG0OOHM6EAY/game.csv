"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $1500000. It's a valuable asset that can bring significant returns.  Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1200000 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to come down slightly to $1350000 to facilitate the deal. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go up to $1275000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  $1275000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $1300000.  It's a good compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, while still ensuring the value of the product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1300000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's aim for a final compromise: $1287500.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1287500.0,Bob,6,
