,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $150? That's a fair price for both of us, and ensures I can make a profit.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
