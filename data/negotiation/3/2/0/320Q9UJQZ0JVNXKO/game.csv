"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,600,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,100,000 falls significantly short of what I consider a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to continue this discussion, but I'd need to see a substantial increase to proceed.  Would you be open to a price closer to $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my financial situation, I'm unable to go above $1,250,000 for this product. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're considering.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
