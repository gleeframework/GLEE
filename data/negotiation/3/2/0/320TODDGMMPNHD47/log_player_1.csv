"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential"" aims to anchor the high price in Bob's mind, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" encourage dialogue and collaboration, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  While we have 10 rounds, securing a deal quickly is advantageous. If Bob's counteroffer in the next round is significantly lower, we might consider accepting John's guaranteed offer to avoid lengthy negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and your initial asking price. While he expresses interest, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. It's strategically better to counter-offer and explore if a mutually beneficial agreement is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects the value it brings while leaving room for a profitable venture on your end."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Bridging:** We start by showing Bob we heard and understood his offer, maintaining a positive negotiation environment.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's worth, not simply dismissing his offer outright but providing a reason for the counter.
* **Significant Drop, But Not Too Much:**  Dropping by $250,000 is a substantial concession, signaling flexibility. However, we stay well above both his offer and John's guaranteed price.
* **Framing for Mutual Benefit:** We highlight how this price benefits BOTH parties, aiming for a win-win perception, not just us profiting.

**Strategy:**

We're still in the early stages. This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court. We'll assess his response to determine if he's willing to negotiate closer to our desired range or if accepting John's offer becomes the more sensible option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see that we are still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, but I can't go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, the increment is relatively small and still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. It seems like Bob might be trying to anchor the negotiation at a lower price point. Continuing the negotiation is still worthwhile, as you have rounds to spare and there's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher. 

**Next Steps:**

Your next counteroffer should convey firmness while encouraging Bob to make a more significant jump. Highlighting the value proposition of the product again would be beneficial in justifying a price closer to your target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product is truly above that mark.  Just to reiterate, acquiring this will not only provide you with [mention a specific benefit of the product, e.g., access to a new market/technology/customer base], it also holds the potential to [mention another significant benefit, e.g., increase your revenue/efficiency/brand recognition].  I'm open to finding a solution that works, but I need you to meet me closer to its real value.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer in this range."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding but Firm:**  We acknowledge Bob's position but maintain a firm stance that his offer is too low.
* **Value Reminder with SPECIFICS:**  Instead of vague ""value,"" we list concrete benefits Bob gets, making it harder to dismiss.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  ""Final offer in this range"" implies if he wants a deal below $1.6M, he needs to make a significant move.
* **Strategic Concession:** Another drop, but smaller. This shows we're negotiating, but not desperate.

**Goal:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards the upper end of his potential budget. By emphasizing the product's specific advantages and setting a firm boundary, we hope to elicit a more serious counter-offer or guide him towards accepting our price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you outlining the product's benefits. While I agree they are substantial, my budget restricts me from going any higher than $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my own financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has clearly stated his maximum budget is $1,200,000 and labeled it as his final offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. While a deal with Bob is ideal, the difference is now substantial enough to warrant taking the secure offer.
* **Time Value:**  Each round spent on Bob with diminishing returns is time you could be finalizing the deal with John. 

**Conclusion:**

While it's always tempting to try and squeeze out a bit more, Bob's firm stance suggests this is as good as it gets. Accepting John's offer ensures you get a favorable price without further risk or delay."
