"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
