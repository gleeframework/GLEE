"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is still a little high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
