Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, knowing that John is willing to pay this amount.  This sets a strong baseline for the negotiation and gives me the option to walk away if Bob doesn't come close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'll reject it. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
