Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,900. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price, as I know it's something you're interested in.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 11900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it slightly below $12,000 creates a perceived bargain for Bob while maximizing Alice's potential profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $12,000. This gives her leverage in negotiations with Bob."
