Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a good strategy. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to consider it.  This allows for potential further negotiation if Alice rejects the counteroffer."
