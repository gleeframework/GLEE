{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate, while I leave some room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150. Although it's getting closer, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, so it's the best option for me at this point."
