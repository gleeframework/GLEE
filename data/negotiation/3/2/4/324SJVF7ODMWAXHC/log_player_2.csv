"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is better than John's $15,000, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, but it gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price and can afford to reject Alice's offer of $11,000.  He wants to see if he can get closer to his desired $10,000 price point.  While $11,000 is a good price, rejecting allows him to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. How about we settle on $10,500?  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground with Alice. $10,500 is a compromise that's halfway between his last offer of $10,000 and Alice's counteroffer of $11,000. This shows a willingness to work together and hopefully get a deal done before he has to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob, as he's managed to get the price down from Alice's initial $12,000 to $10,750.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer and the price will go back up.  Accepting at this point secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
