"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
