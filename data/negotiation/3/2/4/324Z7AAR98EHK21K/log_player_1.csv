Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he's not, I'm prepared to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering a price of $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $16,000. This is a good outcome as it is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I initially hoped for a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with the same price from John."
