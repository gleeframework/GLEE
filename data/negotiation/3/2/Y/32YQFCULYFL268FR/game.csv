"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $125? This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $125 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $95? That's a significant jump from my last offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
