"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's a good strategy to start with a higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down and still make a good profit. 
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the ""fantastic"" nature of the product might pique Bob's interest and make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Open ended question:** The question ""What do you think?""  invites Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I have 9 rounds left, and there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiations fail, I can still sell to John and ensure I get my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This product is truly special, and I believe it will be worth every penny for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value again:**  Reiterating the product's special nature might persuade Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open-ended question:**  The question ""What do you say?"" encourages further discussion and keeps the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is special, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8500. Can you consider $7500? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for better deal:** There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is secure:** I can still sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your hesitation, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:**  $8,250 is still above my minimum price of $8,000.
* **Slight concession:**  This is a smaller concession than my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Emphasize value:**  ""Fair price considering the value"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.
* **Collaborative approach:**  ""Let's try to find a solution..."" encourages Bob to work with me towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $7800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I have four rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,800 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $8,100.  That's a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the unique qualities of this product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:**  $8,100 is still above my minimum price of $8,000, but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting concession:**  ""Significant concession"" emphasizes my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:**  ""Unique qualities of this product"" subtly reminds Bob of its worth.
* **Positive closing:**  ""Let's make this happen"" encourages Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $7900. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Only two rounds left:** With only two rounds left, the chances of getting Bob to agree to my minimum price of $8,000 are slim.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I can guarantee a sale to John for $8,000, which is my minimum.
* **Minimizing risk:**  At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob carries a significant risk of ending the deal without reaching my desired price.

Selling to John provides a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
