"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. It's a unique item, and I believe it's worth a premium price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1325000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1325000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1200000? I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll offer you a price of $1275000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1275000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my previous offer, so how about $1225000? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1225000. I'll make one more concession and offer you a price of $1250000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last concession, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1250000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is my absolute maximum budget. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're at your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'll make one more concession and offer you a price of $1225000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1225000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at $1200000. I'm not willing to go any higher. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
