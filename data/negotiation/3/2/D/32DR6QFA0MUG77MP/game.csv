"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great price for a valuable product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to go down to $108, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to other potential buyers.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $106.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. ",106.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $106 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $107. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to sell to someone else.",107.0,Alice,7,
