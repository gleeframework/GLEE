"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's asking price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $950,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a bold counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets a strong negotiation position and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer by stating he values the product at $950,000. This adds legitimacy to his proposal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even at $950,000, Bob is still willing to pay more than John's offer, leaving room for a compromise that would benefit both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Alice has lowered her price, which shows willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's target price and not a significant enough discount. 
* **Potential for Further Reduction:** Bob can likely secure a better price by continuing to negotiate. He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for Alice to come down further.
* **Maintain Momentum:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to make a more attractive offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob is proposing his absolute final price, which is also John's price. This shows Alice that there's no further room for negotiation from Bob's side. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob frames his offer as a compromise, emphasizing that he's willing to meet Alice halfway between their previous offers.
* **Urgency:** This is the 4th round, and Bob wants to secure the deal quickly. His final offer might encourage Alice to accept to avoid potentially losing the deal to John."
