"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $950,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* It leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* It's still less than the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000), making it potentially attractive to him.

By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, I believe I can still secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $875,000. This is still significantly higher than his offer, but it's a concession from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 

This price is also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, while still leaving some room for negotiation. It aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, I'm only four rounds into the negotiation, and there's still room to try and get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a slight concession in this counteroffer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, potentially pushing Bob closer to my desired price.  I'm aiming for a price that's more appealing to Bob while ensuring I'm not sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I've been through 6 rounds of negotiation already.  I'm concerned that I might not be able to secure a higher price with Bob, especially considering the limited number of rounds remaining.  John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement, and I'm confident it's the best option at this point to avoid potentially losing out on a sale altogether."
