"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable paying $9,000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $10,500? I'm really hoping to make this deal work, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500. I can offer you the product for $11,250. This is the best I can do, considering the value it holds for me.",11250.0,Alice,5,
