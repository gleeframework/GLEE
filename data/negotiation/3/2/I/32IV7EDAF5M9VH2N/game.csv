"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still looking to make a significant profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $820,000. This is a fair compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $820,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $790,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll find it acceptable.",790000.0,Alice,5,
