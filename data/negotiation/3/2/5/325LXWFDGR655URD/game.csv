"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 undervalues it.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This offer represents a compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that $950,000 reflects a fair value considering its potential.  I'm hopeful we can reach a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While the product is very valuable, I understand your budget constraints. My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than reasonable considering what you're getting.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
