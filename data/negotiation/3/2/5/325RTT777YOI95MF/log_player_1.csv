Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you an advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position to push for a higher price.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Strong Price:** $1,350,000 is a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while still leaving you with a considerable profit margin above your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down if he's inclined, potentially leading to a final price above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. You could choose to start even higher and be willing to negotiate down. The key is to balance confidence with a realistic assessment of Bob's potential counter-offers."
