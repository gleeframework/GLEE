Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I've done my research and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value is unknown to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
