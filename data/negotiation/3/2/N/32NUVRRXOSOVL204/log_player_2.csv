"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds to go, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a modest counteroffer. He's offering $1,000 less than Alice's initial price, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal, but also indicates that he's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a value you'll appreciate.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's target price, he's confident that he can get it even lower. With 7 rounds remaining, there's still room for further negotiation, so rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer is the better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $9,250. This would be a good deal for both of us and get us closer to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now making a more aggressive counteroffer, but he's still being reasonable.  He's only asking for a $250 reduction from Alice's previous offer, which is a relatively small amount. This shows Alice that he's serious about reaching an agreement, but he's not willing to overpay. With 6 rounds remaining, Bob has a good chance of getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about $9,400? That's just a small step from your last offer, and it's still a great value for you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,400, which is only $150 away from Bob's last offer.  Considering there are only 5 rounds left, it's a good time to accept.  While Bob might be able to get an even lower price, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price is increasing. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for Bob and avoids potential future complications."
