"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob recognizes its value.  This opening offer also allows room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product is worth more.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and secure a higher price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
