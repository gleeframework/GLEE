Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and it's close enough to Bob's ideal price of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a price that is within his budget and saves him a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
