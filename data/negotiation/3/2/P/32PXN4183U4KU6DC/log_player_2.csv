"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay from John. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to gauge Alice's flexibility. This is a good starting point to see if she's willing to negotiate. If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate downwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my initial counteroffer, but it's still a bit high. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000 before considering buying from John.  I will continue negotiating to try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be willing to consider this offer? I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this purchase."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm still staying below my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good price.  If Alice rejects this offer, I might start considering John's offer, as we are getting close to the number of rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000, which is my absolute minimum. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is closer to my target price.  While I would still prefer a lower price, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the product to another seller. I will accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
