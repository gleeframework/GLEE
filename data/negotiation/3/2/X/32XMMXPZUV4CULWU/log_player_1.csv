Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $108. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. I'm also running out of rounds, and selling to John would mean a significant loss compared to this offer."
