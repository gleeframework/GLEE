"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm starting with a price of $200, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $200 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I still have 9 rounds to try and get a better price. I'm not in a rush and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob, but $150 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice.  $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $165.  Let's split the difference. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $165, which is only $10 below my desired price. It's a good compromise and with only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking getting a lower price.  It's also a significant improvement over John's offer."
