"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price of $11,500. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a high-value item at a great price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $11,000 is less than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **It's a good deal compared to John:** Buying from Alice saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rounds and a higher final price, potentially exceeding Bob's budget.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice given the current situation."
