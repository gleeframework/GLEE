Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects its significance. Would you consider purchasing it for $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price but still provides a substantial profit margin over Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
