# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While you could reject her offer hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll come down further. Accepting this offer secures the product at a significant saving compared to buying from John."
