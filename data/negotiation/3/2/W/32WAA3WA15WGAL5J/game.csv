"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some flexibility on my end.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate that you're willing to come up in price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit low for me considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair price given the benefits it offers. Let's try to meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to close the deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate that you're increasing your bid.  However, $13,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for some flexibility on my end.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",14500.0,Alice,7,
