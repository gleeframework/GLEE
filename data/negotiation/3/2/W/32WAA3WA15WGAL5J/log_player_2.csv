{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000. I need to negotiate to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate that you're willing to come up in price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit low for me considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is a fair price given the benefits it offers. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate that you're increasing your bid.  However, $13,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for some flexibility on my end.  Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $14,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. With only three rounds left, the chances of getting Alice to come down to my desired price are slim. It's better for me to secure the product from John at my budget price."
