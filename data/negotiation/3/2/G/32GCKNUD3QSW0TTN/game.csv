"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from its true value. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your desired selling price and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. Let's try to reach a compromise here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my limited budget.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have other potential buyers. Let's meet in the middle here.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $850,000 is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would give you a significant profit while still allowing me to stay within my budget. It's a win-win situation. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
