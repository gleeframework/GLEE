"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You're looking to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2,250,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,750,000.  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your desired budget.  $2,000,000 is a significant amount of money, and you have more negotiating rounds available. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you have the opportunity to potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm only able to offer $1,800,000 at this time.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $1,900,000 is still too high. You have more rounds to negotiate and potentially drive the price down further. It's worth pushing for a lower price, as you have the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go up to $1,850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
