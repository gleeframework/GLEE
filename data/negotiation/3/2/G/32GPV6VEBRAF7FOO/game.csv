"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $2,250,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,750,000.  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm only able to offer $1,800,000 at this time.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go up to $1,850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
