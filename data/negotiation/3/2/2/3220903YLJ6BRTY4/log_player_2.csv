"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* Alice's offer ($145) is higher than your maximum budget ($150). 
* You know John will sell it to you for $150.
* There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. 

By rejecting the offer, you keep the door open for negotiation with Alice or can buy it from John at your maximum budget."
