Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated the price down to $925,000, saving you $275,000 from Alice's initial offer.
* **John's Price:** John's offer is only $75,000 less.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks her raising the price or you running out of rounds.
* **Time Value:** Every round spent negotiating is time you could be using the product.  

While you might be able to get the price slightly lower, the risk likely outweighs the potential reward at this point."
