"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this compromise?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is closer, but still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we settle on $1,025,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's close this deal!",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $975,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $998,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this final offer?",998000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit off on the price.  While I understand your limits, I can't go below $1,000,000.  This is a fair compromise given the value you place on the product.  Let's end this negotiation on a good note and close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
