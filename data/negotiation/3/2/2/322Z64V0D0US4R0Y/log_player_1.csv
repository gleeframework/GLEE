{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,200,000 is his absolute limit.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. Accepting his offer would mean a $300,000 loss compared to John's standing offer.  Therefore, the most profitable decision is to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
