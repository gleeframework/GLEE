Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $10,000 offer isn't excessively high, leaving space for Bob to potentially negotiate down if he finds it slightly steep. This increases the chance of a sale above your minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer."
