{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where you're aiming for a higher price than your minimum, while still being reasonable for Bob. It leaves room for potential counteroffers and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $750,000? I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $750,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.
