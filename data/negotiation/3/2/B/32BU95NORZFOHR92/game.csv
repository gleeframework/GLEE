"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $8,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11,000, and we can go from there.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one?  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $12,000, which is my minimum. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
