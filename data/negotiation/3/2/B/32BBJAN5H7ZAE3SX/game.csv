"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a fair offer, considering I'm already going above my initial budget, and it's closer to your desired price than my previous offer. I hope we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
