"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your own minimum. Let's work towards a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
