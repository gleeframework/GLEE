Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) gives me space to potentially negotiate down, but still secure a price higher than my minimum. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How I proceed will depend on Bob's response. If he outright rejects the price, I might counter with a lower offer, gradually moving closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
