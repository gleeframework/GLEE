"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility.
* **Within My Budget:** The offer is well below my $1,000,000 maximum, ensuring I have room to increase if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This aggressive counteroffer will help me understand how eager Alice is to sell and how much lower she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,400,000 is better than her initial offer, but it's still significantly above my $1,000,000 limit and John's alternative offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move down suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  I'll use the remaining rounds to try and get Alice closer to my budget, keeping John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have another offer for $1,000,000. To make this work for me, I'd need you to come down significantly. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning the other offer (without revealing John's name), I'm creating a sense of urgency and giving Alice an incentive to lower her price.
* **Significant Jump, But Reasonable:** The offer of $900,000 is a substantial increase from my previous one, signaling a willingness to compromise, but it's still well within my budget and a significant saving over her last offer.
* **Direct and Honest:**  Being transparent about my constraints can help move the negotiation forward more efficiently."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty. It seems like we're both aiming for a deal here. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Limit:** Alice explicitly stated this is her final offer and the lowest she can go. 
* **Above Budget:**  $1,200,000 is still $200,000 above my maximum budget.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John offers the product at $1,000,000, guaranteeing a saving of $200,000 compared to Alice's ""final"" offer.

Since further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay, it's more strategic to cut my losses and secure the product from John at a price I know works."
