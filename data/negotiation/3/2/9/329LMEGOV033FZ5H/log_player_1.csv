Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have another offer for $1,000,000. To make this work for me, I'd need you to come down significantly. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a much lower price, and his latest offer is still significantly below my minimum. While selling to John is always an option, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty. It seems like we're both aiming for a deal here. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  In this round, I'm holding firm at my absolute minimum price.  I'm making it clear this is my best and final offer, conveying a sense of urgency. This leaves the ball in Bob's court and gives him a final chance to accept a price that works for both of us."
