"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $20,000, we are setting a high anchor. Even if this price is rejected, it might influence Bob's counteroffer to be higher than it would have been otherwise.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a significant gap between Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and our minimum ($15,000).  A high starting price allows for exploration of that gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 matches our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to negotiate for more, there's no guarantee of success. Accepting this offer secures a profitable deal and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
