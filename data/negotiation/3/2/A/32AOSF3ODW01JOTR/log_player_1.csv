"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the benefit to Bob, framing it as a ""great deal"" for him.
* **Room for Compromise:** The offer leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Maintaining My Value:**  I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) to ensure I don't undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is $12,000:**  My goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's not my ideal outcome.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. This means there's potential to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 10 rounds, I can't afford to settle too early, especially since selling to John is a guaranteed $12,000. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round, I can continue to leverage the negotiation process to my advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but I can't go any lower. This product is truly unique and offers you significant value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not by a significant amount. This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but also sets a clear limit. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to Bob, reminding him that even at $9,500, it's still a good deal.
* **Setting a Limit:** By stating ""I can't go any lower"", I'm making it clear that this is my final offer.  This puts the ball back in Bob's court and motivates him to make a decision.
* **Positioning for Success:** This counteroffer allows me to potentially close the deal in this round or set the stage for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** While $9,200 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my $12,000 goal.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to push for a higher price and potentially get a better deal in the remaining rounds. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any point, making it a secure fallback. This allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and ensure I'm making progress towards my target price. 
* **Counteroffer in Round 5:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round, potentially securing a price closer to $9,500 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand your position, $9,200 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,400. This is my final offer before I explore other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Finality:** I'm establishing a sense of urgency by stating it's my ""final offer."" This creates pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Potential for Success:** $9,400 is a reasonable compromise, potentially leading to a deal in this round.
* **Preparing for Next Steps:** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to either make a final counteroffer in the next round or sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Short:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low, even considering his ""final offer"" statement.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the potential for a better deal is dwindling, and the risk of losing time is high. 
* **Guaranteed $12,000:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my desired outcome. This eliminates the uncertainty and potential for further negotiation with Bob.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd like to achieve a higher price, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential benefits of further negotiation.

I'm confident that selling to John is the best decision in this situation. It maximizes my profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price than desired."
