"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there.  $1,450,000 is too low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
