Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there.  $1,450,000 is too low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of our negotiations and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  I'm confident that John will buy the product at my minimum price, so I'll go ahead and sell it to him."
