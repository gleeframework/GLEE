"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is quite a bit below my asking price.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still too high for me. How about we settle at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
