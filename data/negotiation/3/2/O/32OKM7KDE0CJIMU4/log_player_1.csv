Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $10,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $10,000.

By offering $11,500, I am:

* **Maximizing My Profit:** I am aiming for a higher profit than what John would offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob may be willing to pay a bit more, so there is room for negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I still have a guaranteed sale with John."
