"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $6,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers you a lot of value, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be transparent.  I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. I'm willing to make one final offer to you because I think this product would be a good fit. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000. She's introduced the pressure of another buyer, and you can save $1,000 by going with your alternative option (John)."
