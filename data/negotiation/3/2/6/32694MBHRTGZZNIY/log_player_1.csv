Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, so I'll offer $14,500. That's as high as I'm willing to go.

Explanation: Bob is very unlikely to go above $15,000. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting a worse deal from Bob."
