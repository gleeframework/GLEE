"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice since you can get the product for a lower price from John."
