Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and a great deal for you. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the discount, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $10,000 is a fair price and ensures I don't miss out on a sale. It's also a better deal than selling to John for the same price."
