Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a bit higher than what it's worth to him, but I'm hoping to get a good price. If he rejects, we can negotiate further.  I'm willing to walk away and sell to John for $80 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still a bit higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to my minimum price and leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly higher than what John is offering, it's still a good deal for me. It's more profitable than selling to John, and continuing to negotiate with Bob might risk him walking away entirely."
