"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum.  I believe this is a strong starting point, giving Bob a good incentive to negotiate but leaving me a good amount of room to potentially drop the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good amount, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but still maintains a healthy profit for me.  I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to secure a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. It demonstrates a continued willingness to negotiate while still keeping my earnings above my minimum threshold. This should hopefully push Bob closer to accepting a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher number in the next round. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing flexibility and that I'm getting closer to accepting a deal.  With only a few rounds left, I want to see if we can finalize this negotiation without risking selling to John for the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. It's getting late in the negotiation, but there's still room for me to counter and push for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decisive move. I'm counter-offering with $925,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. It's a risk, but I believe this is the best chance to close a deal without risking selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and unfortunately, Bob's offer is now equal to what John is offering. Since I've already negotiated with Bob for several rounds, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal completely. I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. Although it's not the ideal price, it's still above my minimum and ensures I don't walk away with nothing."
