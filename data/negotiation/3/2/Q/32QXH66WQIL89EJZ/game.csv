"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a good compromise, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go a bit higher, how about $96?",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. I'm going to make one last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.  How about $99? That's a great price for you, and it gets me just a little closer to my target price. ",99.0,Alice,7,
