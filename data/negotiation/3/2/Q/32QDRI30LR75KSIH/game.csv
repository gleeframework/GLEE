"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $925,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is certainly attractive, I believe this product's value justifies a higher price point.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $890,000. This reflects the product's unique value while recognizing your initial investment.",890000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. Considering the value I'll get from the product, I'd like to make another counteroffer of $860,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between your initial offer and my initial budget.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I've tried to find a price that acknowledges the true value of this product while also making it attainable for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your latest one. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $835,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",835000.0,Bob,6,
