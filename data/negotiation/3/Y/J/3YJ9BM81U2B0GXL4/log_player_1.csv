"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's important to show confidence in the product's value and leave some wiggle room for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I'm confident that I can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and strike a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. I'm trying to find a balance between a reasonable price for Bob and a profitable price for me. This feels like a fair middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial before the time runs out. Given the risk, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure a guaranteed profit."
