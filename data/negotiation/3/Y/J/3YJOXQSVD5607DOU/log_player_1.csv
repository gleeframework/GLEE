Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $85 is still a bit low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $87?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $87 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's better to accept his offer than to risk a lower offer in the next round or to have to sell to John for $80."
