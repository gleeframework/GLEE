"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits and potential for you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $925,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your budgetary considerations, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about this: I'll come down to $1,000,000, and that's my final offer. This price reflects the true value of this product and the significant return on investment you'll see. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $950,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
