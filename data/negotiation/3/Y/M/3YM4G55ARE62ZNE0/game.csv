"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $150. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $110 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $110, so I'm counteroffering at $92.50. It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with it!",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  $92.50 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $80? That's the most I can justify spending right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $95. It's a good price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",95.0,Alice,7,
