"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to consider the value of the product and the time I've invested in it. I can see you're serious about the purchase, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $1300000.

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000. I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal, though. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which is a $50000 value.

"I understand you're not willing to go any higher, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000. I'm willing to give you an additional concession, though. I'll throw in a 10% discount on the initial purchase price, which would bring the price down to $1170000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1170000.0,Alice,9,
