"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob.  He can get the product for $800,000 from John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This reflects its true value to me and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $975000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've acknowledged it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Since Bob can get the product for $800,000 from John, rejecting the offer gives him a chance to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, considering the product's true value to me is $1200000, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is the best compromise I can make, considering the value I've invested in the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Since Bob can get the product for $800,000 from John, he should take that option and end the negotiations with Alice.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice if Bob can get a better price elsewhere."
