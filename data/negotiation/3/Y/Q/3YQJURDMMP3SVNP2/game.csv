"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $900,000? This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,
