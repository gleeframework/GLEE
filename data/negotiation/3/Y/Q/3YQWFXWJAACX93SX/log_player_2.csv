**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is full of salesmanship, her offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer opens up the possibility of a better deal. If Alice really wants to sell to you, she might come back with a lower price. If not, you can always buy from John at the same price."
