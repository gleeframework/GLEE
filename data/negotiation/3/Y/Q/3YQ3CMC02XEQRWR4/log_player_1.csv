Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to make this transaction particularly smooth for you with a price of $1,150,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,150,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. It's a price that earns you a significant profit above Bob's perceived value while still being enticing to him. 
* **Positive Messaging:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and Bob's ""insights"" adds perceived value and encourages him to consider the offer seriously."
