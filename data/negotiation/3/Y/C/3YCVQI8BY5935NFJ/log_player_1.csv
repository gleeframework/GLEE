"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob's counteroffers less aggressive.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the high price (""value and potential"") makes it appear less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording implies willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in multi-round bargaining.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and a strong alternative with John. Rejecting this offer signals that you're aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to move down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the unique value this product offers and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:**  The significant decrease from $2,300,000 to $2,000,000 signals flexibility. However, it remains comfortably above your minimum and projects seriousness about the product's value. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the ""unique value"" reinforces your position that this product is worth more than Bob's initial assessment.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims to nudge the negotiation towards a price point closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and the price John is willing to pay.  

* **No Further Gain:**  It's unlikely Bob will go higher, and you risk him walking away in further rounds.
* **Equal to Alternative:** Accepting this offer secures you the same profit as selling to John.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty and potential delays of continued negotiation."
