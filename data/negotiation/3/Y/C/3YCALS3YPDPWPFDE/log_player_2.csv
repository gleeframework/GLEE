"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product at a special price. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value. Would you like to buy it from me for $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.**  You would pay $9,500 from Alice versus $12,000 from John.
* **You are still saving money.** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($8,000), it's still lower than your maximum budget ($12,000)."
