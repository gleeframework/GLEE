"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $160. How about we meet in the middle at $180? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $170. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $150, but I'd like to get closer to that price.",170.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to compromise further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $170. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $165, which is the closest I can get to $150 without going over. Can you consider that?",165.0,Bob,6,
