"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? That's a fair price for both of us and avoids the risk of either of us losing out.",100.0,Alice,5,
