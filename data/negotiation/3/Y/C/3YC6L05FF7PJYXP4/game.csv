"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1750000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering it's worth less to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is still below what the product is worth to me. This would be a great deal for you, and we can finalize the sale.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1500000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1250000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $1250000 is a fair offer, I need to get closer to $1500000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1375000.  This would be a significant benefit to you, and we can finalize the sale quickly. Let me know if you're interested.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1375000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a very fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1300000 is a good offer for you, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1350000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale quickly. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close.  $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1325000. This is a great compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly. What do you say?",1325000.0,Bob,8,
