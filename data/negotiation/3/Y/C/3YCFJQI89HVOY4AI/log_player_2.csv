"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, meaning there's no potential for saving money by accepting. Buying from John is essentially the same outcome, but it avoids the uncertainty of negotiating with Alice."
