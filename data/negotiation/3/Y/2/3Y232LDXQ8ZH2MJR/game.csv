"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this price reflects its true value.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is closer to my maximum.  I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than I could get elsewhere.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,250,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows you to make a profit while still staying within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to go down to $1,285,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",1285000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,285,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
