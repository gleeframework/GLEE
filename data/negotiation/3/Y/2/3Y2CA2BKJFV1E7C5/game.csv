"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000?  This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, which would be $1,112,500. Would you be open to considering this price?",1112500.0,Bob,4,
