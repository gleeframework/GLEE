"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? This still represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal!",10750.0,Alice,5,
