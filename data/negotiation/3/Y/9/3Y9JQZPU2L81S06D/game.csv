"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we settle on $10500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer you $9800. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will allow you to turn a profit while staying within my price range. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet in the middle from my previous offer at $10750?",10750.0,Alice,7,
