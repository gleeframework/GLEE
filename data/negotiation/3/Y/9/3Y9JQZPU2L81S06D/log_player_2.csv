"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we settle on $10500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,500 is still more than his maximum budget, and he has a few more rounds to try and get closer to his goal.  He should try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer you $9,800. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will allow you to turn a profit while staying within my price range. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet in the middle from my previous offer at $10750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice is not budging much further, and Bob has only three rounds left.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially ending up with nothing.  John's price is within Bob's budget, so it's the best option."
