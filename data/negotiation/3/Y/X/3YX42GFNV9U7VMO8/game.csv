"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product is good, but not quite at that price point. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  It's a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This way, we can both benefit from the deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I can do $1,125,000.  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,262,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1262500.0,Alice,5,
