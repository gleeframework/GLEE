"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you.  This price allows me a little more profit than my minimum, but I'm confident it's still fair given the value you place on the product.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000 if you decline.
