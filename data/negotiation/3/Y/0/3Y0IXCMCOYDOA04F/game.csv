"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to recoup some of my investment. How about $13500?  This would allow me to sell and still make a reasonable profit. ",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? That way, we can both feel comfortable with the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
