"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring if a better deal can be reached. There's no need to rush into buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This aims to gauge Alice's seriousness and see how much wiggle room there is in her asking price.  It's a bold move, but Bob is willing to risk losing the deal to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate aggressively, so it's worth continuing to try and push for a lower price. There's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's budget, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying but still trying to get a better deal.  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer while still aiming to keep the price under $650,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, and there are only five rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better deal, but there's a risk of losing the deal altogether or running out of time. At this point, accepting the offer is a good compromise, securing the product at a price within Bob's budget and leaving some room for negotiation with John in the future."
