"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product, which is fair given its value to me. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows us to both get a good deal.",160.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $165, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",165.0,Alice,5,
