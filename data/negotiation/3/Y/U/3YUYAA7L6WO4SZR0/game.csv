"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations. Let me know if you're interested!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1300000, so I'll counter with $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $800000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $900000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $1000000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
