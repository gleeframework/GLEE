,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $107.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $107.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $107? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",107.0,Bob,6,
