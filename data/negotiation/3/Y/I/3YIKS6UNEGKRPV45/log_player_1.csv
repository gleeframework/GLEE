Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Just Below Guarantee:** Offering the product slightly below John's offer ($145 vs. $150) might entice Bob while still securing a near-optimal profit for Alice.

**Important Note:**  This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value of $80."
