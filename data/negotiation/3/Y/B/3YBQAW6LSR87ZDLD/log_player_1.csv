"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is above Bob's perceived value of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  A lower starting price increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer in the early rounds. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $150 is tempting, I want to maximize my profits and see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm willing to explore further. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I'm not desperate to sell at that price. I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($100). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Price:** $125 is still above Bob's perceived value of $120, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not going much lower than this, but I'm open to further negotiation."
