"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also shows that I value the product and am not just looking to get rid of it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $60 is far too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth at least $100 to me. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer.  I hope this will encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price. I hope this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I won't settle for anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is higher than his previous offers, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price. I don't want to sell to John yet as I think I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95. This is my final offer, as I'm getting closer to my minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's previous offers and my own minimum value for the product. If Bob rejects this, I will sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John.  Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and we've reached the point where I'm risking a deal falling apart.  It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer."
