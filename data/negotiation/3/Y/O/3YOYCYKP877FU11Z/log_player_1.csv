"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept such a low offer yet. I have 8 rounds left to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}
