Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives him a reason to negotiate but doesn't completely eliminate his interest.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for potential negotiation and a profitable outcome for you.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** This makes you appear more flexible and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than your initial offer of $12,000.  It's important to stand your ground and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is still below your ideal price, it's getting closer to your minimum. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer at this point secures a reasonable sale and avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
