"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $850,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm happy to discuss the product further, but I'd like to start with a counteroffer of $750,000. This would give us both room to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $760,000. This would be a fair price for me, and it would still allow you to make a good profit.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $760,000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this price.",765000.0,Alice,5,
