"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal that works for both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is grossly overvaluing the product to try and pressure you into a bad deal. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is your maximum price."
