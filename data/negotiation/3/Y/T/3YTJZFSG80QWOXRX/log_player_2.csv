Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest. However, $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.  Let's make this happen!

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $12000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen!
