"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest. However, $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $12000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen! ",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll need to seriously consider purchasing from another seller.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your offer. However, $10500 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $11500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let's close this deal! ",11500.0,Alice,7,
