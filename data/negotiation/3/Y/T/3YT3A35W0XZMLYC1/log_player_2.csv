Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to make $13,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in between 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is sticking close to her original price.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll go below $12,000 and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Better to secure the price with John."
