"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $150 to you, and John is willing to sell it for $150, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
