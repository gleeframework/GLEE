"Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be extremely valuable to you, given its potential to [briefly explain the product's value to Bob].  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the significant benefits this product can offer your business, and it's a good starting point for us to continue our discussion.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while also giving you a good return on your investment. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm eager to reach an agreement. However, $950,000 still falls short of my minimum requirements. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $975,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
