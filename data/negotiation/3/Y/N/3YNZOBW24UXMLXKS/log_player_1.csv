Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be extremely valuable to you, given its potential to [briefly explain the product's value to Bob].  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which still represents a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.**
* **I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I can always sell to John for $800,000.** This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the significant benefits this product can offer your business, and it's a good starting point for us to continue our discussion."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while also giving you a good return on your investment. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.**
* **I have 6 rounds left.** I'm confident I can continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price from Bob, or at least reach my minimum threshold. 
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I'm aiming for a better outcome.**  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm eager to reach an agreement. However, $950,000 still falls short of my minimum requirements. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $975,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
