"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your serious offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping you'll consider this.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is still a bit below my target, but I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1150000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
