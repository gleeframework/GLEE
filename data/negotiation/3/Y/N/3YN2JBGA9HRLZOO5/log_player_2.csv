# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your serious offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price again, but you're getting closer to John's price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping you'll consider this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1050000 is still a bit below my target, but I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1150000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,150,000, which is still above your budget. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it's better to buy from John to save money."
