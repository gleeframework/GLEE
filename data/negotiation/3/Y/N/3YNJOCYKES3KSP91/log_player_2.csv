{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You have a significant margin to work with.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($900,000) is a good tactic. This sets the tone for negotiation and allows for potential compromise. You have a good amount of room to move up if Alice counters."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is increasing her offer, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's too early to go to John, as you haven't exhausted your negotiating options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

You've made a significant concession from your previous offer, so you want to show Alice that you're serious about a deal. You're also acknowledging that Alice is unlikely to sell for $700,000. This counteroffer is a good compromise point, considering both your goal and Alice's potential profit."
