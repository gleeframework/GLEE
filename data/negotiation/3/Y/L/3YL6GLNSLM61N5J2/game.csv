"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe  $1,100,000 is a fair price that reflects that.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
