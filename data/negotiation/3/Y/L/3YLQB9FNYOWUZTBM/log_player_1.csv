Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a profit if he accepts the initial price.
* **Time Value:** Even though John offers $120, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable to waiting for John's purchase. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
