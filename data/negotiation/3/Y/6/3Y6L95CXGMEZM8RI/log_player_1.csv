"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's value to me ($8,000), hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also trying to be friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for your product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still potentially get a better deal with Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still looking for a slightly better price. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows him I'm willing to compromise while still hoping to get a better price than what he offered.  I'm also reinforcing the value of the product in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,200 for your product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is closer to my desired price than the previous offers.  Since we're only on round 4, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too inflexible.  Accepting this offer allows me to make a small profit, and there's a good chance I'll get a better deal in future negotiations with other buyers."
