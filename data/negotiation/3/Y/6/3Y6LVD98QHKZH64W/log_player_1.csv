"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is a good start, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1675000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,675,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair given the value of the product and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, accepting this offer secures a sale above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for my minimum."
