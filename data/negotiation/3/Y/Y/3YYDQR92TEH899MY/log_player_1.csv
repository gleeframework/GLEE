Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still fair considering the value the product provides. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. If we can meet in the middle here, I'm confident we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly lower than my initial goal, $15,500 is a good deal. It's a fair compromise, and it avoids the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
