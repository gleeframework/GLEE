Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider that?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we're getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can negotiate a better deal than John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has countered below my minimum acceptable price and appears to be anchoring firmly around $825,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Selling to John for $800,000 is the best option at this point to ensure I don't lose a guaranteed sale."
