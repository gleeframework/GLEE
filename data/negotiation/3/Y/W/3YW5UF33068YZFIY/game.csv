"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1000000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'd be willing to pay $750000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $750000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the potential value of the product. Let's keep talking!",900000.0,Alice,3,
