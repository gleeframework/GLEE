Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  It's a great deal for a high-quality item."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) and my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""high-quality"" and ""great deal,"" I'm aiming to create the perception of value that might justify the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy the product at my minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. My ultimate goal is to maximize my profit while ensuring the deal happens."
