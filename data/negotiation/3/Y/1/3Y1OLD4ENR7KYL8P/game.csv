"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,200,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
