Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This price is still a good value for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
