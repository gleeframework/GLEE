Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  A starting price of $15,000 leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue the product.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  Mentioning openness to negotiation signals that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at such a drastic drop in price.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob or, in the worst case, sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,000.
* **Value Justification:**  I highlight the product's quality to emphasize the value I'm offering.
* **Openness:**  I continue to express a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Balanced Approach:** I'm not giving away too much, but also not being overly stubborn, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down.  $13000 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $10000.  If you can't go lower, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go below $12,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees a $12,000 profit, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob holds the risk of further lowering my price or wasting time, while John offers a certain and satisfactory outcome."
