"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, so it's not worthwhile to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $10000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. He's willing to pay up to $10,000, so $13,000 is still too high. He'll continue negotiating."
