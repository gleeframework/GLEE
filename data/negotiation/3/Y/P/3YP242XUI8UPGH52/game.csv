"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves room for a very profitable venture for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could meet you halfway at $950,000.  Do you think that would work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 just isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $975,000.  This is a very fair offer that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
