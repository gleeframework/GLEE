{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, hoping to make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiating, encouraging Bob to counter if he feels the price is too high.
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Although Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product.  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to $11,000. Would you be open to discussing that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product, hoping to emphasize that $11,000 is still a fair price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm using language that encourages further negotiation, leaving the door open for Bob to counter again. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping John in mind, ensuring that I have a solid backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider selling the product to me for $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** While $10,750 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation room:** I believe there's still some room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he's showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **John's guaranteed sale:** I have a secure sale with John for $12,000, providing me with the flexibility to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm looking for something closer to $11,250.  If you're willing to meet me halfway between our last two offers, I think we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm holding firm on my minimum price, demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the idea of compromise and meeting halfway, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to make a final move.
* **Open to Finality:**  I'm suggesting that $11,250 could be a final offer, subtly pushing Bob towards a decision.
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I can walk away if Bob doesn't meet my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, as you suggested. Would you consider selling the product to me for $10,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for further negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $10,875 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John's Guaranteed Sale:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could drag on and potentially lead to no deal.  It's more efficient to accept John's offer and secure a profitable sale."
