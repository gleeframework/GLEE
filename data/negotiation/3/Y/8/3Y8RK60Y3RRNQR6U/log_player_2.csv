"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations. Let's aim for a fair price. How about $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $140 is better than $150, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.  He's still $20 below his maximum price, and a counteroffer could lead to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about $135 for the product? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $135, he's still saving $15 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his offer, and he'll have fewer rounds to work with.  It's a reasonable price for both parties and a good outcome."
