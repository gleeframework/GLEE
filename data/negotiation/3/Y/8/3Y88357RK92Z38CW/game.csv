"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $9000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's still a great deal considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $9500 is a more reasonable price. I'd be happy to accept that offer. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. It's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
