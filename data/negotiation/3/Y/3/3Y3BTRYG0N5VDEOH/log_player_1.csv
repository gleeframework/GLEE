Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's start with $1,100,000. This is a fair price given the value to me and the market.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I can't go as low as $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's worth.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's still less than what John is offering. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale at a higher price."
