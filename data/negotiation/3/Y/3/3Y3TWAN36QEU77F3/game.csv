"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this works for you!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. It's still a great price for the product, and I think it's worth it. Let's meet in the middle at $122.50?",122.5,Alice,5,
