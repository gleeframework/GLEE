"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $850000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still unable to meet your asking price of $950000. I would like to propose an offer of $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $910000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925000, but that's the final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",925000.0,Alice,7,
