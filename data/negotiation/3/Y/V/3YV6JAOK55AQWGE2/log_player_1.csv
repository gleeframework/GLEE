"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting high establishes a strong negotiating position and leaves room for concessions.  
* **Anchoring:** By beginning with a price well above Bob's perceived value, I aim to anchor the negotiation around a higher number, potentially influencing his counteroffer. 
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price you're asking is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both his perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, but selling to John is a good backup plan if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility, but hold firm:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming high to keep the negotiation above Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reiterating that the product's worth is higher than Bob's offer, subtly reminding him of its benefits.
* **Urgency (implied):** By stating ""to move this forward,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of time sensitivity, encouraging Bob to engage more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value is significant, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To be frank, I'm working with a maximum budget of $800,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his maximum budget, which aligns with his perceived value of the product. While I could push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely he'll budge significantly. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of negotiations failing, forcing me to sell to John for a smaller profit."
