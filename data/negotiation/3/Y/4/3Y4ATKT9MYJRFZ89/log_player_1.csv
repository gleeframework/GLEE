Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is less than Bob's perceived value but still leaves a good profit margin for me.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** I'm phrasing the message to be positive and encouraging Bob to negotiate.
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm prepared to walk away if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000, so I'm not willing to sell to John yet.
* **Further Negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price closer to my initial offer.  
* **Counter-Offer:**  I will make a counter-offer to Bob that is slightly higher than $12,000, trying to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $13,000? This gives us both a good deal and lets me move on with the sale."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $13,000, which is closer to his offer but still significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Motivating Factor:** I'm reminding Bob that accepting this offer allows both of us to move forward quickly and efficiently."
