Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my ideal price.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and the value I think he places on the product before deciding how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a good starting point. It's closer to my value than $1,000,000, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my floor price, but it's still not enough. The risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential gain, especially since selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable amount."
