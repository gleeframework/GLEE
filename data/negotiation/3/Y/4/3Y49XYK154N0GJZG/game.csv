,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $140? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I can do right now. Would you consider $155? This is my final offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $165. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",165.0,Alice,5,
