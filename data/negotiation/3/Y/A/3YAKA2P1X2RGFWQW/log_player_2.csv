"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and you can try to get a better price. You can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price is still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is within my budget and closer to my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical decision in this situation."
