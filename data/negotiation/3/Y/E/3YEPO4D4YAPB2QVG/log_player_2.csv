"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find it especially valuable.  I'm asking for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $110. You can potentially get a better deal, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You still have room to negotiate.  While $102 is better than $110, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer will give you a better chance of getting a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $102 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $98? That's a fair compromise and gets us both closer to our desired price."", ""product_price"": 98}
