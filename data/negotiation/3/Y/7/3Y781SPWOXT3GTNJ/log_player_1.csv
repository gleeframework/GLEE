Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum if he accepts outright.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Why not...**

* **$150 or higher:**  Bob will definitely reject this, knowing he can get it from John for the same price.
* **$120 or lower:** This is below my minimum acceptable price and I'm better off selling to John."
