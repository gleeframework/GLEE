"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we do $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
