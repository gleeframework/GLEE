"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $9,500 is more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering me.  However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand it's a bit more than you initially wanted to pay.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is still above his budget of $8,000, and he has a solid option to purchase the product from John for that price. There's no need to risk paying more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still really interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $8,500.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm at $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750.  This is a good deal for both of us and allows us to close this transaction.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down significantly, the price is still higher than what John is offering.  Bob has reached his limit and doesn't want to risk going over budget.  It's a better decision to accept the guaranteed lower price from John."
