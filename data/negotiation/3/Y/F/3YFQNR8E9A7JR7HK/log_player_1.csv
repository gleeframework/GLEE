"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also emphasizes the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating but am also aware that I can sell to John for my minimum.  I'll see if we can reach a deal, but I'm prepared to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering a price of $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, but I'm still maintaining a healthy profit margin.  I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm concerned that we're going to spend several more rounds back and forth.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John. He's already offered my minimum, and I'm not willing to risk losing that certainty."
