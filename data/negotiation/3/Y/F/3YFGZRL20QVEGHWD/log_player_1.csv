"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not convinced this is the best I can get.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  This should encourage Bob to come closer to my target without pushing him away completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come down to $14,200, which is close enough to my desired price.  It's important to remember that I have only 10 rounds and could potentially end up selling to John for $10,000. I think accepting this offer is the best option in this situation."
