"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Opening with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This high initial offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his valuation of the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your fallback option with John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob meeting you ""halfway"" from your inflated initial offer suggests he's quite interested and potentially willing to go higher. Rejecting now keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that price is appealing, I'm still confident this product can bring you significant value beyond that. How about we settle at $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're coming down significantly from your initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to move closer to your desired range.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The $1,700,000 price point keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price while still being a potentially enticing offer for Bob, given his initial counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he rejects this, you can reassess your strategy and decide whether to push further or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a substantial profit over your minimum acceptable price and significantly better than your fallback option with John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you might be able to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, the potential gains are relatively small compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids prolonging the negotiation and allows you to allocate your time and resources to other opportunities."
