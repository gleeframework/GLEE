Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that John is willing to pay that amount. This gives me a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it above Bob's offer.  This counteroffer shows I'm open to negotiating, but I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting further away from my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go any lower, and since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to sell the product to him for $10,000."
