"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. It's a great value considering its worth of $120 to you. Let me know if this works for you!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to sell the product for $108, which is higher than your offer but still below its perceived value to you. This allows us to reach a fair agreement. Please let me know if this proposal suits you.",108.0,Alice,3,
