# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it could significantly benefit your business, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, but I'm offering it for $1,250,000. This allows for a substantial profit for you while ensuring a fair deal for me. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
