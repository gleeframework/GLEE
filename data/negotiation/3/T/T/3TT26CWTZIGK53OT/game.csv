"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it once you have it.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $11,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be happy with the deal.  Let's close this out.",11500.0,Bob,4,
