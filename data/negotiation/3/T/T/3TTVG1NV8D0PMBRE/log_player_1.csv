Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob is a good starting point. It allows for some negotiation room without immediately being unreasonable.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  A $1,000 difference leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and still get a good deal, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Plan B:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails. This sets a minimum price I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  I can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding selling to John at a loss:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a better option than accepting Bob's offer, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous offers. How about $10,000 for the product?  It's a fair price considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Firm stance:** I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Staying focused on the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject and counteroffer, there's a risk he'll either reject again or continue to lower the price.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a good deal and avoids the potential for a lower offer from Bob. While it's not the highest possible price, it's a safe and reliable option."
