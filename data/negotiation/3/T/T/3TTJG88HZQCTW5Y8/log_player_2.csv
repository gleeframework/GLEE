"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know this product is worth significantly more to you.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,150,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer represents a savings of $50,000 compared to your alternative."
