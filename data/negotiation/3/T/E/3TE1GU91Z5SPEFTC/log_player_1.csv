{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down slightly. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $11,999 price point feels significantly less than $12,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, there's always a chance he could back out.  It's generally good to secure a deal with the most profit as soon as possible, rather than relying solely on backup options."
