Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. After careful consideration, I am willing to consider your offer of $85. However, I must respectfully request that you reconsider this amount as it is still slightly above the product's perceived value to you. I propose we settle on $87 for the product. This price allows for a fair transaction between us, considering the product's worth and my need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.
