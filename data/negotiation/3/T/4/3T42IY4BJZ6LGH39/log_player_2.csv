"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is significantly more than your target of $800,000.  By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price would still leave you with a considerable profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?

While $1,025,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your preferred price point.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to try and push for a lower price."

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to your target, it's still too high.  You're determined to save as much as possible.
