"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer.  There's a chance she might be willing to negotiate lower, especially since you have the option to walk away and buy from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it signals that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It's a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to try to squeeze out a bit more.  Rejecting her offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.  If Alice isn't willing to budge further, I can always buy from John for my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. $11,500 is a good middle ground between my last offer and Alice's most recent one. This shows good faith while still leaving room for Alice to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is only $1,000 more than my last counteroffer. Given that I have a backup option with John, I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a lower price and having Alice walk away.  At this point, it's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I've gotten the best possible price from Alice."
