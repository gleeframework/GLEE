"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8000 to you, and I know you'll get good use out of it. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above what the product is worth to me and leaves you with a decent profit.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle and I'll do $10000. That's a great price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good middle ground. Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9000, but I'm still not there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $9500 for this product.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
