Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still above what the product is worth to me and leaves you with a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good middle ground. Let's finalize this deal.
