"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Since John is offering the product for $120, Bob can secure the product at the best possible price by buying it from John."
