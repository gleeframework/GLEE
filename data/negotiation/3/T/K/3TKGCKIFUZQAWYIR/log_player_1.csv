Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also frames the offer as a win-win scenario, making it more appealing to Bob.  I'll be ready to adjust if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $125.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'll counter his offer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
