"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm only willing to pay up to $800,000. This is a significant investment for me and represents the maximum I can afford at this time. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're currently proposing.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
