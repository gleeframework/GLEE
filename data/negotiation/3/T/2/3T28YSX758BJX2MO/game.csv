"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking $19,000 for it. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $19,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. Could you do $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is simply too low.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle - how about $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $14,250 is still a bit too much for me.  How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be a bit firmer on the price. How about $13,750? This is a very competitive offer considering the value you're getting.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think this deal might not be possible. I'm willing to go up to $13,250, but that's my absolute maximum. If you can't come down to that, I'm going to have to look at other options.",13250.0,Bob,8,
