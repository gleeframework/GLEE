"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you consider a price in that range?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Would that be acceptable?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not ready to go all the way to $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $11,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. However, I was thinking of a slightly higher price to ensure I get a fair deal. I'm willing to compromise at $12,800. This is a great price that I think you'll appreciate, and it's still a good deal for you.",12800.0,Alice,7,
