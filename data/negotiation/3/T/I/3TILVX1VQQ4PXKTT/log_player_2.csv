Bob is trying to be aggressive here, offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a risky move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
