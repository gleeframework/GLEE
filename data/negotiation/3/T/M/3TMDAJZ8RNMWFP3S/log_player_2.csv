{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  $70 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $65?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 65}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $65. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $72. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $68. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can do $73. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really close to your target price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can do $74. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $74. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $74
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where you're very close to your desired price, but Alice is being stubborn.  At this point, it's likely that you won't be able to get the price lower than $74 with Alice.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it's more efficient to go with John at this point to avoid further negotiation with Alice."
