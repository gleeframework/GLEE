"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $5,000?  That feels like a fair price considering its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is the lowest I can go.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about we settle at $6,500?  That's a significant compromise for me.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $6,500 is still too far below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,750?  This is a fair compromise for both of us.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $7,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",7000.0,Bob,6,
