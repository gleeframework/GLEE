Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While I appreciate your offer,  $900000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?  That's still a fantastic price for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $1050000.
