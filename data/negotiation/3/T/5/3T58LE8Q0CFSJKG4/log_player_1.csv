Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a decent profit. Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, and it's even lower than his own perceived value. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with him before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? It's still a great price for you, and a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below your initial target, it's very close to his perceived value of $10,000 and significantly higher than his initial offer.  Accepting this offer guarantees you a sale and a decent profit, avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to Bob altogether."
