"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. While I think it's a great product, $150 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about $115?  I'm really hoping to make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $120. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I really think this product would be a great fit for you. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
