"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and what John is offering. You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
