"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can likely get a better price through negotiation or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll counteroffer at $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating, aiming to bring the price down further. He should also keep the option of buying from John in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer $12,500. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  There are still rounds left, and he should try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,500, but I'm not going any lower. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. He's already been through several rounds of negotiation with Alice, and it's clear that she's not willing to go lower than $11,500. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and save $3,500."
