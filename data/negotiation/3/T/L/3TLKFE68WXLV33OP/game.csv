"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. While I see the value in the product, I can only offer $500000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500000 is significantly below the value I'm looking for.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $700000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is still significantly lower than the product's value.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower the price to $850000. This is a fair price considering the value and my need to move this product quickly. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a solution, but $850000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $820000, which is very close to my limit.  This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this final offer.",820000.0,Bob,6,
