"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allows us to close the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
