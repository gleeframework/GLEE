"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  I have a few more rounds to work with before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob before I have to decide whether to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a price a little closer to $9,250.  Would you be willing to go to $9,100?  It's just a small increase, and it would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $9,100 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,250, which is $9,125. Can you accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,125. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John would be better, but it's risky to wait and risk losing Bob completely."
