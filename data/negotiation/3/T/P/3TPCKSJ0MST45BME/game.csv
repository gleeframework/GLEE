"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my budget, I'd be willing to offer $900000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still a bit out of my comfort zone at $1050000.  I'm prepared to offer $950000, which is closer to my initial offer and represents a significant savings for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1025000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. I'm confident that you'll find it's a great investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1037500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1075000.
