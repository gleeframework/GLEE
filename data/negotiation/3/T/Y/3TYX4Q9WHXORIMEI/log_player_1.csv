"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you at $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a high anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial price gives me ample room to negotiate down while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum.
* **Projecting Value:** The high initial price also reinforces the idea of the product's high value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to buy the product for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value for the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me. It's clear we have a lot of ground to cover in negotiation. 

While I could take the immediate offer from John, I believe there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob that would still net me a higher profit than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, the new price is still well above both my minimum and his initial offer.
* **Signaling Value:** I'm reiterating the product's inherent value to justify the higher price point.
* **Aiming for Mutual Benefit:**  I'm striving for a price that acknowledges Bob's budget limitations while ensuring I receive fair compensation for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now above his own perceived value of the product and represents a reasonable compromise. While it's less than I was initially aiming for, it's still a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. 

Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching a stalemate. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale at a favorable price."
