"Dear Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
