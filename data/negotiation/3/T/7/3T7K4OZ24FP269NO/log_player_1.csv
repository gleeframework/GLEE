"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question to invite Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have 10 rounds, and there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** While $15,000 is a guaranteed sale, there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to get a reasonable price for the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $17,000 to $14,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob by framing the price as a ""good deal"" for him.
* **Reiterating my value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $12,000 to me. This helps justify my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 6 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate further. I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing to counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's getting us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering to split the difference between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Progress towards a deal:** I'm emphasizing the progress towards a deal, making Bob feel closer to a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the new offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of getting a better price from Bob is diminishing. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential gain.  Selling to John is the most secure and efficient way to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
