Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's a bit more than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but also a significant portion of Bob's perceived value. This should encourage Bob to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I still have room for negotiation with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a smaller step down from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still holding onto a good portion of the potential profit."
