Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent amount of money, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  I'd rather secure a sale now than risk losing out entirely."
