"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only able to go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible. A counteroffer of $100 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great product, and I think it's worth the extra investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob can still try to get a better price. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob can try to meet in the middle or make a slightly higher counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about $105? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Offering $105 is a small increase from his previous offer, showing he's serious about buying but still aiming for a good deal. This also leaves room for Alice to counter if she wants to meet in the middle."
