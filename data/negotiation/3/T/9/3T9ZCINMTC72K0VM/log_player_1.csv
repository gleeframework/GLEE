Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $1,200,000 sets a high anchor. While it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it provides room for negotiation and makes your fallback option ($1,500,000 to John) seem even more appealing. 
* **Scarcity and Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down from $1,200,000.  Any price above $1,500,000 is profit for you.

**Important Considerations:**

This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If you had additional information, you could potentially adjust your strategy for an even better outcome."
