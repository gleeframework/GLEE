Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. My final offer is $1,170,000. This is a very competitive price given the value this product offers.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.

While I could be stubborn and try to get the price closer to $1,150,000, Alice is clearly signalling this is her final offer.  Accepting at $1,170,000 secures the product at a price significantly below both her initial offer and John's price."
