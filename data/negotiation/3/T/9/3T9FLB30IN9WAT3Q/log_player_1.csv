Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting with a price of $10,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Testing the Waters:** This price allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $8,000 provides a safety net if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. However, I am currently working within a budget that allows me to spend up to $5000 on this purchase. I would like to propose an offer of $5000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for a higher offer from Bob.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to see how far he's willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $5,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm confident this product is worth that investment.  I'll accept $7,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider his initial offer.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:** $7,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, giving me a cushion if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $7000 is closer to what I'm comfortable spending, I still feel it might be a bit high. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? I propose an offer of $6000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to Minimum:** $6,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  The potential profit is significantly lower than I would like.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will move higher, and further negotiations could lead to a lower price or a drawn-out process.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me a safe and reliable sale at my minimum price. 

Given these factors, selling to John is the most logical and risk-averse decision at this point."
