"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is better than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit higher than I'd hoped.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This would still leave you with a good deal, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $120, and Alice's offer of $110 is within that range.
* **Savings:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll end up paying John $120.
* **Compromise:** $110 represents a compromise, and Bob can save $10 compared to buying from John."
