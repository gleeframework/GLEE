"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000, given its incredible value.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500? That's a significant offer on my end.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? That's a significant price drop on my end and shows how motivated I am to make this deal work.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  However, $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer $12,000. This is my final offer, as I can always buy the product from another seller for that price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
