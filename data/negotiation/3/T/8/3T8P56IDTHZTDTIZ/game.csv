"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product just as much at this price.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
