"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $17,000.  What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product, and I'm willing to offer $11,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a step in the right direction, but I still need to be sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $12,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to receive a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $12,000 is still stretching my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?  I'm confident this price would be fair for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,
