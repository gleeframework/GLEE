"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product but $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can do $750,000, but that's as low as I can go.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking that I could do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $725,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a bit more profitable for me.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to come up slightly, but $725,000 is pushing it.  Would you consider $710,000?  That's a very strong offer.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! $710,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $715,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can shake on it.",715000.0,Alice,7,
