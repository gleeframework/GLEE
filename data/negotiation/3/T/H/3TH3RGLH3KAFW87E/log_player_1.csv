"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me. This will give me some room to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer.  I'll see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could accept it and make a small profit, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can counter with a more appealing price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's $15 more than what he offered. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit more, but I'm also not willing to go too low.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm still confident I can get at least $100 if I need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. While I'd prefer to get $100, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of a further negotiation."
