"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price? I'm thinking something closer to $650,000 would be more reasonable.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $700,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price point closer to $675,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $675,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $690,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",690000.0,Alice,5,
