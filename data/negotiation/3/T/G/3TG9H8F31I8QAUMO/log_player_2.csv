"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase my product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price? I'm thinking something closer to $650,000 would be more reasonable."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Acknowledge Alice's offer and express interest:**  Building rapport is important in negotiation.
* **Establish a lower target price:** Starting with a significant counteroffer helps create room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Provide a reason for the counteroffer:** This helps justify the lower price and makes the negotiation feel more collaborative."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice is moving closer to my desired price range, but I think there's still some room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer a bit closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $700,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price point closer to $675,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"",
""product_price"": 675000
}
``` 

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledging Progress:** It's important to recognize Alice's willingness to negotiate and move down on the price. 
* **Incremental Approach:** By proposing a smaller price reduction this round ($25,000 instead of $50,000), I signal that I'm getting closer to my limit while still aiming for a better deal.
* **Clear Target:**  Stating my desired price range directly ($675,000) helps guide the negotiation towards a mutually acceptable outcome."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, $675,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $690,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While I could push for a slightly lower price, $690,000 is a good deal and significantly less than my $800,000 alternative with John. It's time to accept and secure the product."
