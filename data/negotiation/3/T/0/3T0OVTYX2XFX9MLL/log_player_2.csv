"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good price, there's potential to get it even lower. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $7,000 is a substantial step down from Alice's initial price of $7,500, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, and Bob can adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $7,200 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for improvement.  Bob is determined to get the best deal possible and has already shown he's willing to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price but wants to test Alice's willingness to compromise. A $7,100 offer is a slight increase from his previous counteroffer, showing that he's willing to meet Alice halfway while still aiming for a lower price. This might encourage Alice to accept before Bob decides to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has shown some flexibility. While he'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $7,150 is very close to his ideal price and represents a significant discount from the initial offer.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a good deal."
