"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $120. I'm willing to pay up to $80, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with my maximum offer of $80. This is the price I'd be willing to pay to buy the product from John, so it's a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not willing to pay $100. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'll offer $85. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing some willingness to compromise, but still well within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to pay $95. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm going to reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'll offer $90. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept. We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still hesitant to pay more than $90."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further, and while $92 is tempting, I'm not sure I can convince her to go lower. It's better to lock in a deal with John at $80 than risk running out of time and getting stuck with a higher price."
