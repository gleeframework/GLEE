Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer more attractive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counteroffer again.
* If negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not getting close to my minimum, I'll move on to John and sell for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still protect my interests. 
* **Evaluate Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction to my counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counteroffer again.
* **If negotiations stall:**  If I feel like I'm not getting close to my minimum, I'll  move on to John and sell for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm emphasizing the idea of a fair price for both of us.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm making it clear that I'm motivated to reach a deal.

**Next steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction to my counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counteroffer again.
* **John as backup:** I'll keep in mind that I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, giving me leverage in the negotiations.
* **Be flexible:** I'll be open to further negotiation if needed, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable paying $875,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000, and that's my final offer. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is unacceptable:** Bob is refusing to budge on his price of $850,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **No further negotiation:**  I've already made concessions and reached a point where further negotiation seems futile.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's final offer.

**Next steps:**

* **Sell to John:** I'll move on to John and finalize the sale of the product for $1,000,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum goal and get the best possible price."
