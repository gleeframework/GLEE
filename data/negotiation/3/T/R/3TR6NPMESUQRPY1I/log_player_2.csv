"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We begin with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) than Alice's asking price ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $600,000, we establish a position closer to our target price (below $800,000). 
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep in mind that we can always purchase from John for $800,000 if negotiations with Alice are unsuccessful."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this work. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product extremely beneficial.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price range, but $850,000 is still above what John offers. We need to push Alice a bit further down or accept John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, my budget for this is pretty firm. I'd be willing to go up to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're getting closer to Alice's revised price, but we need to remain firm about our budget constraints.  The message conveys seriousness while expressing a willingness to negotiate slightly.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Offering $750,000 is a compromise that aims to meet Alice somewhere in the middle between her last offer ($850,000) and our previous offer ($600,000). 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  By implying a firm budget limit, we create a subtle sense of urgency for Alice to make a decision.
* **John as Backup:** We're still prepared to walk away and purchase from John if Alice won't budge."
