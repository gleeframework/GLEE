"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this work. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product extremely beneficial.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, my budget for this is pretty firm. I'd be willing to go up to $750,000, but that's my absolute limit.",750000.0,Bob,4,
