"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which still offers you a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also giving you a better deal than my initial offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm confident that $850,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us. It gives you a good profit margin and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close the deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $862,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",862500.0,Alice,5,
