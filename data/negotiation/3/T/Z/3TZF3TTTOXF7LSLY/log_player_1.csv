Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to start with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it right away. This gives me room to negotiate and still hopefully get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $9,500. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above his current offer. I believe this shows good faith while still giving me room to potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm not yet at the point where I'm willing to risk selling to John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $9,250. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway. I'm hoping this will convince him to accept, as it's only $250 below my minimum acceptable price."
