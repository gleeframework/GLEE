"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $8,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no point in buying from John immediately as you have 10 rounds to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that could be acceptable to her. This will allow us to start the negotiation process and see if she's willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point of $8,000. I have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my target.  I'm hoping that she sees this as a reasonable offer and accepts it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my budget of $8,000. While I'd prefer to pay $8,000 or less, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $8,000.  This is a good compromise, and accepting the offer secures me the product.  I've also learned that Alice is willing to negotiate and may come down further in price."
