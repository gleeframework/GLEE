"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $100? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
