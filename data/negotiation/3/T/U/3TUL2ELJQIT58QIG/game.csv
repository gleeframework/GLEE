"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the best I can do right now.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get the best price. While $108 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $109? This way, we can both be happy with the deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. Would you be willing to go down to $107? That's the lowest I can go.",107.0,Bob,6,
