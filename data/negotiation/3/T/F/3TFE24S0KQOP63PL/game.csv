"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation while still acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,550,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
