"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and makes your initial offer seem less aggressive.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you're ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if the price is high, it sets a reference point for subsequent discussions.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** This high starting point gives you plenty of room to make concessions throughout the negotiation process, which can help build goodwill with Bob.
 * **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind your fallback option with John at $1,500,000. You'll need to move towards a more agreeable price with Bob quickly if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is significantly lower than both our desired price and John's offer. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation while still acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We're making a sizable reduction from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to move toward a deal.
* **Still Above Target:** This counteroffer keeps us significantly above both Bob's valuation and our fallback option with John, providing room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the high price without directly dismissing Bob's offer. 
* **Urgency:**  While we have time, it's good to make progress in each round. This counteroffer encourages Bob to engage more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,550,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Our Minimum and John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 exceeds our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and John's standing offer. 
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has effectively moved the price closer to our desired range. Accepting now secures a good profit.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  While we could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving us with John's lower offer. 

Accepting at $1,550,000 represents a successful negotiation and a solid profit."
