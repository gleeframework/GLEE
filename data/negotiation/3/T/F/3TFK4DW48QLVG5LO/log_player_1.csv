{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product for a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice. It also acknowledges the value of the product to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a great product, but I've done my research and I know it's worth less than that to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below the $1,400,000 that Alice offered initially. Alice has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, but she shouldn't give away too much value too quickly.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows Alice to explore a counteroffer and see if she can secure a price closer to her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,300,000?  That's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,350,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Alice would ideally get closer to her initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for Alice, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this point."
