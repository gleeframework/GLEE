"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit high for you, but $1,200,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if that works for you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
