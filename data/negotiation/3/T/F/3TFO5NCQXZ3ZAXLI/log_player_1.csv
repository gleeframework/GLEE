"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing the value and the opportunity for a good deal. 
* **Strategy:**  By starting high but still within a reasonable range, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially lead to a counteroffer. This gives me an opportunity to better understand his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price closer to the product's true value. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a higher price. Selling to John would guarantee my minimum value, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially earning more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go any lower than $11,500. This still represents a substantial discount for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $11,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still protecting my minimum profit margin.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the discount while being firm in my position.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while also establishing a clear boundary. It aims to encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, how about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $11,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $12,000, I'm running the risk of losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
