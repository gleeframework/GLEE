"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell it for. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $60 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. It leaves room to gradually increase the offer.
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains courteous and expresses interest in the product, fostering a good negotiating environment. 
* **Strategic:** By starting low, we gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Would you be interested in that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While $90 is closer to your budget, it's still above what John offers. There's room for Alice to come down further. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Offering $75 splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($90) and your previous offer ($60), demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Approaching the Limit:** This counter-offer is getting closer to your $80 maximum, putting pressure on Alice to either accept or potentially lose the sale.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** The message continues to be polite and collaborative, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal! I can do $82, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  Alice's offer of $82 is still slightly above your $80 maximum. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You know John will sell you the product for $80 without further negotiation.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a small chance of saving you $2, but there's also the risk she won't budge further and you'll end up with nothing. 

At this point, it makes more sense to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
