"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price is getting closer to what I can afford and is a fair price considering the product's value.  I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds. Let's try to make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.

With only a few rounds left, I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we're down to the wire here. $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 one last time. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to go with another buyer.  Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
