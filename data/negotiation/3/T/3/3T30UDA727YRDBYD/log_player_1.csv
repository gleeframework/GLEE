"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price, especially since I have multiple rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting a product worth $800,000 to you for a slightly higher price. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the closest we've come to a mutually acceptable price.  While it's still below my ideal value, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer, and it's above John's offer. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation and the potential of John's offer expiring."
