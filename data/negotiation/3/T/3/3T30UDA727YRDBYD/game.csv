"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I believe it's a great investment for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting a product worth $800,000 to you for a slightly higher price. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
