"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600000 is significantly lower than what I'm seeking, I'm willing to compromise. I'd be open to selling it for $1200000. This price still reflects the product's value, but allows for some flexibility. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm looking for a better deal. How about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $900000 is still far below what I need to consider. I'm prepared to go down to $1000000. This price reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,6,
