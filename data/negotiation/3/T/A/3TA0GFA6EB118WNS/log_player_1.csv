Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price I'm comfortable with. While I'm hoping for more, John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is above my minimum threshold. I'm going to sell to John to secure this amount and avoid further negotiation."
