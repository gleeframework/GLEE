"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,250,000? This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $1,175,000 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is a very fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,185,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,195,000 as a final concession. This price reflects the immense value of this product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!",1195000.0,Alice,7,
