Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down slightly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering the product at $14,500, there's space for Bob to potentially counter-offer.  This keeps the conversation open. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, allowing you to hold firm if necessary.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to purchase. There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential gain of $14,500 outweighs settling for the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
