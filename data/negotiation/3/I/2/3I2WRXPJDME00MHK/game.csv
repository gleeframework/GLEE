"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $860,000? This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $860,000. I can offer you a price of $880,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. However, I want to remind you that I have other interested buyers, and if we can't come to an agreement, I may need to explore other options.",880000.0,Alice,5,
