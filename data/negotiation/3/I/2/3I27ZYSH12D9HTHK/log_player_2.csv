"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its exceptional value and quality, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure an item that is worth $1,500,000 to you at a competitive rate. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than her product valuation.  There's room for negotiation to lower the price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still comfortably above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling a strong desire to purchase the product. 
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** The goal is to eventually meet somewhere in the middle, ideally closer to Alice's $1,200,000 valuation than my $1,500,000 maximum. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware that John offers the product for $1,500,000. This knowledge allows me to negotiate confidently, knowing I have a backup plan if the deal with Alice falls through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I would like to accommodate your needs, I must respectfully decline your offer of $1,100,000. I am unable to go below my initial offer of $1,350,000. However, I am willing to discuss terms that might be mutually beneficial. Could we perhaps find a middle ground that respects both the value you place on the product and the investment required? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice reduced her offer by only $50,000. This indicates she's willing to negotiate, but at a slow pace. 
* **Room for Improvement:** There's still a considerable gap between her offer ($1,300,000) and both her valuation ($1,200,000) and my target price.
* **Leveraging Alternatives:** By rejecting and counter-offering, I signal I'm serious about a better deal and am willing to walk away if necessary, especially with John's offer available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm definitely serious about buying, but to make this work I need to be closer to $1,200,000.  How about $1,225,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer aims to bridge the gap quickly. It's a compromise between Alice's lowered offer ($1,300,000) and my previous counter-offer ($1,100,000). 
* **Above Her Valuation:**  Importantly, it's still a profitable deal for Alice, as it's above her $1,200,000 valuation.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By proposing a specific number and phrasing it as a solution, I'm hoping to encourage a quicker resolution. I'm still mindful of the clock, and John's offer serves as a reminder that I have other options."
