"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I would like to accommodate your needs, I must respectfully decline your offer of $1,100,000. I am unable to go below my initial offer of $1,350,000. However, I am willing to discuss terms that might be mutually beneficial. Could we perhaps find a middle ground that respects both the value you place on the product and the investment required?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
