"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. Rejecting this offer allows you to move on to your backup option and secure the best possible price."
