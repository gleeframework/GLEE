,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's compromise again. I'm willing to drop the price to $1350000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
