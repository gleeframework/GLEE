"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. Considering the value you place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects the value I see in the product, but it's also within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'm offering it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $10,000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in the product. ",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make it. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",12000.0,Alice,7,
