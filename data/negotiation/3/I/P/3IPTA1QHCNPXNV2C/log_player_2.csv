# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
