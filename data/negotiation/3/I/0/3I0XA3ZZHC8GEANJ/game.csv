"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $140?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the original price you had in mind was $150. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",130.0,Bob,4,
