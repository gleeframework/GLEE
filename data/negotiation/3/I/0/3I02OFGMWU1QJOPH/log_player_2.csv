"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14500. It's a great deal, as it's worth $15000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's ideal value, it creates an opening for negotiation.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about $13750? It's a fair price, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still some room for improvement. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting the offer shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal and isn't afraid to walk away. This increases the likelihood of Alice making a further concession.
* **Next Steps:**  By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his previous offer, potentially finding a price that works for both parties."

* **Pressure:**  By making a slight increase, Bob subtly increases the pressure on Alice to make a final concession."
