"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for the value you'll get from the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $7,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
