"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1 million for you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My starting price is $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John at this point would leave money on the table, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value the product will bring to your business. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next few rounds. Selling to John at this point would leave money on the table. I'm going to hold out and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $812,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 812500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the flexibility. How about we settle on $790,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $790,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I'm still not willing to settle.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with just a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm going to make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John at this point would leave too little profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to finding a fair price.  Let's split the difference one more time. How about we settle on $800,000? This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product offers.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
