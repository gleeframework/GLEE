This is my final offer. I'm increasing my price one last time to $12,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope it's enough to convince Alice to accept the deal. If she rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to buy from John at $8,000. However, I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement and secure a good deal for both of us."
