"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept immediately.  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $100 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for compromise without exceeding my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my maximum, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and even if she doesn't, I can still buy from John for my maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product. $110 is still within my budget, and it's closer to Alice's last offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is now very close to my maximum price of $120. It's unlikely she will go lower, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer is the best option at this point to secure the product within my budget."
