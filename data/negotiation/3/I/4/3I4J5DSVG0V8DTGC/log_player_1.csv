{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a steal for what it can do, and I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $2000000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I know the product is worth more than $1,600,000 to me. I'm going to try to get a better price in the next few rounds.  I have a safety net with John's offer, so I can afford to be a little more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my own financial goals. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum threshold, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident I can get him to budge any further.  It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
