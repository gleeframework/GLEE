"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
