"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's below your maximum, there's plenty of room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and you're likely to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than what he'd pay from John, and it's within his budget. It's also clear that Alice is not willing to go lower, so continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
