"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I'm definitely interested, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would make it work for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really think you'll get a lot of value out of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I can do one better. How about we meet in the middle of $10,500 and my original offer of $10,000, which is $10,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll love the product at this price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
