"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum price of $120 but leaves room for negotiation. I believe $140 is a fair price, considering the value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and considering the value he places on the product, it's a good deal for me. Accepting his offer will ensure a sale and save time for further negotiation."
