Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since I value the product at $1,500,000 and John is willing to pay that amount, there's no reason to sell it for less. Offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000 is the best strategy.  

**Here's why:**

* **Maximizes profit:** This price ensures I get the maximum value for my product.
* **No risk:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John at the same price. 

While Bob may not be willing to pay this price, it's the most advantageous offer for me."
