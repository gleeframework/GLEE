"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $12,000 to her, so she's already making a significant concession by offering it for $11,500. However, I can do even better by buying it from John for $8,000.
