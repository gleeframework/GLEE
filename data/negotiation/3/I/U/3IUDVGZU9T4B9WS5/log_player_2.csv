"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's very fair for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something valuable, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
