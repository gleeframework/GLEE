"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'll counter with $900,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's find a way to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still below my minimum. I'm happy to continue discussing this, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $885,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get what we want.",885000.0,Alice,5,
