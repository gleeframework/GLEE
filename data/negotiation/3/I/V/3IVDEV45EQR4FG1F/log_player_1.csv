{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $90.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
