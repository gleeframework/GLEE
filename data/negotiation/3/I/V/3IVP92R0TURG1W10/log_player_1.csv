Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering what you could gain. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000,  selling to Bob at a lower price could still be more profitable than selling to John after potential delays or complications. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 is carefully positioned:
    * **Above Bob's Value:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving us room for negotiation.
    * **Below John's Offer:** It's less than John's guaranteed offer, providing Bob a potential ""deal.""
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite a counter-offer from Bob, allowing for a potentially quicker and mutually agreeable sale."
