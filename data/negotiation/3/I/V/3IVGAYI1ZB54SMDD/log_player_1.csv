"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start by asking for my full value for the product. I know Bob is willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but I want to see if I can push him a little higher. I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John at any point if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with, and it might be enough to entice Bob to close the deal.  I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility I can get Bob closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still too far below my ideal. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little higher with another counteroffer. I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that we're getting close to a deal, and that Bob will see this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $980,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not ready to give in just yet. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push Bob to $1,000,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to meet Bob at his maximum price, but I won't go any lower.  I'm hopeful that he'll finally accept and we can close this deal. If he doesn't, I'll have to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000. I've only got 2 rounds left, and I don't think I'm going to get a better offer from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000."
