"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so he shouldn't accept a price of $9,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $8,500?  It's still a good price for you and a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $8500 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8750.  Let's split the difference and get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,750 is closer to Bob's target price, he can still try to negotiate further. There's room for Alice to come down a bit more, and Bob can try to reach a price closer to his desired $8,000."
