Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to him. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value this product brings to your business. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to counter with an offer of $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value this product brings to your business. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
