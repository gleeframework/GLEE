"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I want to show Bob I'm flexible and willing to compromise. This could make him more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the potential value to Bob might pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 at this time. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** Even though Bob's initial offer is low, I'm going to try to negotiate with him. There's a chance we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer:** While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob as I believe we might be able to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would still give me some room to cover my costs and allow you to get this valuable product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer that is closer to Bob's initial offer, but still higher than my minimum.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the compromise to show I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I mention ""valuable product"" again to remind Bob of its potential benefit.
* **Fair Price:** I've offered a price that is still significantly higher than my minimum, but might be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise but $14000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $11000? This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $11,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob because I have the option to sell to John for $15,000.
* **Room for compromise:** I believe there's still room for further negotiation with Bob to get a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  How about we compromise at $12,500? This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and allows you to get this valuable product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise to highlight my willingness to work with Bob.
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm again mentioning the product's value to remind Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Finding a Solution:**  I'm emphasizing a desire to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $10000? I think this is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $10,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum and a safe bet given the limited time remaining and Bob's continued low offers. 

It's unlikely that I will be able to negotiate a price higher than $15,000 in the remaining rounds, so I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
