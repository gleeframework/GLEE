"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000.  There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price closer to her product value of $1,200,000."
