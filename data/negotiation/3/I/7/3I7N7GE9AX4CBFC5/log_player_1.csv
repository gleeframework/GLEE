"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000, to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I want to establish a strong starting point.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. Bob's offer shows he's interested, but I want to see if I can push him higher.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering $18,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for a potential win for me. It also signals that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer.  If he rejects, I'll consider dropping my price a bit more, but I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my initial asking price, and we're already in round 4. I'm not sure I can get much higher with him, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer is the best choice at this point."
