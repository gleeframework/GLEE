"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $9,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you!",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, which is $9,250. I'm not willing to go any higher than that, so I'll accept your offer of $9,250. Deal!",9250.0,Alice,7,
