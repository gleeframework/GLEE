Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Considering our negotiations thus far, I believe $1,360,000 would be a reasonable price for both of us. It maintains a balance between the product's value and my budget constraints.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,360,000 is a significant profit, even if it's below my initial ask.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether, which would mean accepting John's lower offer."
