"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, so there's likely a price point we can reach that benefits both of us.  Rejecting the offer allows us to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step towards Alice's value of $800,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's still a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than John's price.  I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair offer and accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good deal for me. It's significantly less than what I would pay John, and it's closer to my ideal price. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice walking away or me missing out on a better deal from John is too high. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
