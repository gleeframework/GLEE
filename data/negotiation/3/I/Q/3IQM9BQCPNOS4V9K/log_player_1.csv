"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a highly profitable deal.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This initial offer leaves ample space for me to gradually reduce the price during subsequent rounds while still staying above my $1,000,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the product's value, but I'm looking to negotiate a price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, accepting $900,000 would still mean a significant loss compared to selling to John. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to guide Bob closer to my acceptable range.  I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While this product holds immense value, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to find a mutually agreeable price."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant reduction from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer still keeps me comfortably above my $1,000,000 safety net (John's offer). 
* **Encouraging Movement:** By moving closer to Bob's range, I'm signaling my interest in making a deal but holding firm on the product's substantial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I'm offering $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price and provides a profit. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a favorable outcome."
