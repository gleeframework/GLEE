"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,
