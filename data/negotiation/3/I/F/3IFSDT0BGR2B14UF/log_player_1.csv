Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a great deal, let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a high anchor price ($120) significantly above both my minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $90 is above my minimum price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price and am willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $120 represents the value I place on the product, I'm willing to come down to $105 for a quick sale.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm making a significant concession by coming down $15, but still aiming for a price higher than his offer.  The phrase ""quick sale"" is used to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $105, which would be $92.50. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than my minimum selling price and John's offer. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
