"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal. You're willing to pay up to $150, so you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price down quickly.  I'm offering $100, which is still within my budget and leaves room for potential negotiation. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my preferred price, and $110 is within my budget and a good compromise.  Accepting this offer means I get the product and save money compared to buying from John.  There's always a chance I could get it for even less, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs that potential."
