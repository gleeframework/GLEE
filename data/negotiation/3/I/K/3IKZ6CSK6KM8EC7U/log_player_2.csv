"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic might seem aggressive, but it leaves us space to negotiate upward while staying well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $85 is still above our target. We'll reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $75? That's a decent compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're nudging our offer up slightly, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer and our upper limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 still falls short of what I need. Let's try $82.50. That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to a price we'd likely accept. However, every dollar saved counts. We'll reject and counter-offer one more time, aiming for a final agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close. Let's make this happen - how about $78? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** We're moving closer to Alice's desired price.
* **Sets a firm boundary:** By stating it's our final offer, we signal that we won't go higher.
* **Offers a tempting deal:**  $78 is a significant saving compared to John's $100 price and a reasonable profit for Alice. 

Now, it's up to Alice to decide if she's willing to accept this deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really appreciate you coming up to $78.  To be honest, I can't go that low, but I'm happy to meet you in the middle.  How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met us at her lowest acceptable price.  Accepting this offer secures the product for us at a $20 discount compared to John's offer, making it an excellent deal!"
