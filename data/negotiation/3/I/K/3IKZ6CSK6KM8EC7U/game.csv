"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $75? That's a decent compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 still falls short of what I need. Let's try $82.50. That's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close. Let's make this happen - how about $78? That's my final offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate you coming up to $78.  To be honest, I can't go that low, but I'm happy to meet you in the middle.  How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Alice,7,
