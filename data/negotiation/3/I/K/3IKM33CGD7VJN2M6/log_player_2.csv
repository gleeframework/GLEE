"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, but it's still above the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** My message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but clearly states my price point. This keeps the negotiation open and avoids offending Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice met me exactly in the middle between our previous offers. This is a fair compromise and a good price considering my $150 maximum. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
