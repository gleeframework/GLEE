Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Shows you're serious:**  By offering a price above your minimum, you show Bob you are genuinely interested in selling to him.
* **Sets a clear expectation:** It clearly communicates your initial asking price and opens the door for further discussion. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $880,000 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
