"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.
