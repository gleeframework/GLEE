Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the extensive work behind it.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair offer considering the long-term value this product will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This represents a substantial investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.  However, the value of this product is directly tied to its potential for generating substantial returns, which I believe it can do for you.  I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's more than fair. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down in price, she's unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's her final offer and she knows the product's value to her. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $800,000 from John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation and risking a higher final price."
