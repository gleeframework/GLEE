"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I need to sell for.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",13250.0,Bob,4,
