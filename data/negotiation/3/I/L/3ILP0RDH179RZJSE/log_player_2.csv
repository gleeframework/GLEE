"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is a better offer than $180, it's still above Bob's maximum price. He should continue to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $155. This is as low as I can go, and I hope it's something we can agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $155 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, it's likely that the price will not drop further. It's better for Bob to buy from John at $120, as this is the best deal available and will save him money."
