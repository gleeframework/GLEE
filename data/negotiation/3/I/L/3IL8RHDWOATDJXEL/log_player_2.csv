# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and John's offer. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John for $8,000."
