"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you see the value in. I'm asking for $13,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested buyers. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. John's offer of $15,000 acts as a ceiling, but there's room for negotiation with Alice."
