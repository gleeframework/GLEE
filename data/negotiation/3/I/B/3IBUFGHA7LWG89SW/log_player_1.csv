Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you see the value in. I'm asking for $13,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested buyers. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have the advantage of knowing Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go below our minimum price.

This strategy aims to secure a significant profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
