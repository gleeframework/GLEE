,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $135 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm willing to work with you, but I can't go lower than that.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $120? That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with that price.",120.0,Bob,4,
