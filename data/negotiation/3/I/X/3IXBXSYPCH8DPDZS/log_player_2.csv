"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $135 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $135 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer. This is a tactic to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially create a better deal for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm willing to work with you, but I can't go lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above Bob's maximum of $120. While it's closer to his budget, Bob still has the option of buying the product from John for $120, which is a better deal. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, potentially allowing for a lower price from Alice in the future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $120? That's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his absolute maximum price, making it clear that he's serious about buying the product but won't go higher. This is a strong position to take, as it puts pressure on Alice to make a decision. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can always turn to John for a guaranteed $120 purchase."
