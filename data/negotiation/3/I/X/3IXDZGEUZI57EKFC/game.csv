"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum asking price and still a significant value for you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's a significant amount closer to my minimum. Let's try to close this deal.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $990,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - $1,005,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",1005000.0,Alice,7,
