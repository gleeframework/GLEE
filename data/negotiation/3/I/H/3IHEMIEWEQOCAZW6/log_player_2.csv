Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying, but still trying to get a better price than her last offer.  This is a good compromise point that might get us closer to a deal."

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and I'm now within my budget.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the chance to buy from her and having to go with John."
