"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12,500? This is still a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,750. I think that's a fair price for a product worth $12,000 to you. Can you consider it?",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to go down to $12,250.  This is a fair price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you, and it also allows me to meet my minimum goal. What do you say?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,250, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,900. I think this is a fair price for a product worth $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider it?",11900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting very close to a deal! I'm willing to come down to $12,050. This is only a small difference from your last offer, and it would allow me to meet my minimum price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",12050.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,050, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,800. I think this is a fair price for a product worth $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a small concession to get a deal done. Can you consider it?",11800.0,Bob,8,
