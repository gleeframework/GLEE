"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. My asking price is $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We know we can get it cheaper, either from Alice through negotiation or from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:** Our goal is to pay significantly less than John's $100 price and ideally closer to Alice's valuation of $80.
* **Polite and Direct:** We maintain a polite and professional tone to foster a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above our target. We have room to negotiate and see if we can get closer to $80 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Deal:**  We're signaling our willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price.
* **Strategic Counter:** Offering $77 puts us slightly above the midpoint between her last offer ($85) and our previous offer ($70).
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  We still want to encourage Alice to move closer to her valuation of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  How about we split the difference at $81?  It's a fair price, and it gets us both closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Excellent Price:** $81 is a great price, only $1 more than Alice values the product for, and well below John's $100 offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** We still have a good number of rounds left, but there's no guarantee we can get a better price from Alice. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Trying to negotiate further for a dollar or two difference isn't worth the risk of Alice raising her price or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
