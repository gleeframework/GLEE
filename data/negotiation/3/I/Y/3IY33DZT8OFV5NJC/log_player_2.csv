"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from your perceived value.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your perceived value and you're still willing to negotiate further. You have a good chance to get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and leaves room for you to make a good profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,125,000, it's still higher than your ideal price.  You are confident that you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice.  There is a good chance that Alice will not go lower than $1,125,000 and you risk spending more time negotiating without a guaranteed outcome."
