"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1050000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still profit while I can acquire the product within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1150000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and leaves room for you to make a good profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1125000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.
