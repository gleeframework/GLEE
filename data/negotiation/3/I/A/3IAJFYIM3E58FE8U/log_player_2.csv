"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering it for $140. 
* **Rejecting and buying from John is worse:** You'd be spending an extra $10.

This strategy maximizes your savings while still getting the product."
