"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
