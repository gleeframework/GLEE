"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000).
* **There are more rounds.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting Alice's first offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal price.** While $875,000 is still higher than Alice's valuation, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer and closer to your target.
* **The risk of going lower:** If you reject this offer, you risk Alice becoming more rigid in her price and potentially ending up with a worse deal, or even losing out on the product completely if you run out of rounds.
* **Time is of the essence.** You have only 7 rounds left, and buying from John at $1,200,000 is a worse outcome.

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer ensures you get a good deal and secures the product within your budget."
