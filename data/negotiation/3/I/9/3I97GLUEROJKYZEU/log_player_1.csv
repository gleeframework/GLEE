"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an offer above your target price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number ($2,200,000), we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers might still be higher than if we started lower.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We understand that this initial offer is likely to be met with a counteroffer. The message clearly states our openness to discussion. 

This strategy aims to maximize our potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. We are better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true market value. To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This reflects the immense value and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** We want to signal that we're willing to negotiate by making a substantial reduction from our initial offer. However, we're still staying well above our absolute minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the high price. This helps maintain a strong bargaining position. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge Bob's flexibility.  If he's unwilling to budge significantly from his initial offer, we may consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go up to $700,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it remains significantly below both our initial asking price and our minimum acceptable price. It seems Bob is unwilling or unable to meet our valuation of the product. We will continue negotiating in hopes of a better offer, but we are moving closer to the point where selling to John becomes the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  However, the gap between our positions remains quite large.  I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to see a more significant move on your end to justify it. I'm now proposing a price of $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We are lowering the price again, showing Bob that we are willing to negotiate. 
* **But Firmness:** We are not drastically lowering the price.  The reduction is smaller than before, indicating that we are reaching our lower limit.
* **Call to Action:** We've explicitly asked for a ""more significant move"" on Bob's part, making it clear that he needs to increase his offer substantially if we are to reach an agreement.
* **Nearing the Alternative:**  We are getting closer to John's offer. We will likely accept a reasonable counteroffer from Bob in the next round or two; otherwise, selling to John becomes the more profitable choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're still pretty far apart on price.  To be honest, if we can't find a number closer to my budget, I might have to explore other options. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has presented his offer as ""final,"" signaling he's unlikely to move significantly higher. Even at $800,000, we're looking at a substantial loss compared to John's offer.
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has diminishing returns.  Each round takes time, and it's unlikely he'll meet our minimum even with further concessions.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John represents a guaranteed sale at our desired price. There's no risk of further negotiation or the deal falling through. 

While we could try to squeeze a slightly higher offer from Bob, it's not worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
