Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm happy to present you with the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want a price closer to Bob's valuation while leaving him some room for profit. Offering it at $1,350,000 gives Bob a potential profit of $150,000 if he utilizes the product to its full potential. 

This offer aims to:

1. **Be Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly less than his perceived value.
2. **Maximize Your Profit:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. 

This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's negotiating style, you might have to adjust slightly, but this offer gives you a strong position."
