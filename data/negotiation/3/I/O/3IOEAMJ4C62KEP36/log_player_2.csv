"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. There's no reason to accept this offer. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is more around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $18,000, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price. There's still room to work with, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,500?  It's a good step closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're serious about buying the product. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above Bob's budget of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate as there's still room for Alice to come down further, especially as she mentioned being willing to do better than her offer.  Bob should see if he can get closer to his goal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm ready to move forward with the purchase, but I need a price that's closer to $9,500.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  It's a significant step towards my budget, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make this work, Bob, but I've already come down from $18,000 to $11,500. I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,500, which is $11,000. However, I'm willing to give you a slight concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $11,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still too high for Bob. It's closer to his budget than previous offers, but it's still above his maximum of $8,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a high risk that the negotiations will drag on further, and there's no guarantee that Alice will be willing to go down to Bob's target price. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees a good deal for Bob and avoids the potential for further negotiation failures with Alice."
