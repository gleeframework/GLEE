"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Knowing its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you leverage to negotiate a better price or proceed with purchasing from John at a lower cost."
