"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I think it's a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me at $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down on price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its market value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this would be a win-win for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000.  Would that be feasible?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $9,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $11,500? This is a very fair offer considering the value you're getting.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me, but that's still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $10,250? ",10250.0,Bob,6,
