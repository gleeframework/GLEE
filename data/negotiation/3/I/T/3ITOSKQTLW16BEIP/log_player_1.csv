Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm hoping to get closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 8

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's a bit lower than I'd hoped, it's still a good deal for me, considering the value of the product and the fact that John is willing to pay $12,000. I'd rather secure a sale and get the money than risk losing out altogether."
