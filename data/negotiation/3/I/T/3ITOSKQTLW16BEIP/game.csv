"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to work something out.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9,500 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $10,250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $9,750 is a good starting point, but I'd need to come in at $10,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $10,000, which would be $9,875. Can we agree on that price?",9875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $9,875 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to accept $9,937.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",9937.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher, Alice. I think we've been close enough. I'm willing to meet you at $9,900, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can accept that, I'll buy the product from you.",9900.0,Bob,10,
