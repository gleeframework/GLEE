"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to sell,  I need to be fair to the product's value. Could you consider $1,775,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make sure I'm making a smart investment. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $1,725,000?",1725000.0,Bob,6,
