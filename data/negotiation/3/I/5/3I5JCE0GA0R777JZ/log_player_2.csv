"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a lower price. I'll start by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer. This sets a clear expectation of a lower price and signals my seriousness in negotiating.  $800,000 is still within my budget, but leaves room for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget.  While she's willing to come down, it's still not in a range I'm comfortable with. I'll continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer, but still keeping it below $1 million. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to go over my budget.  The offer is also close to my maximum, so it leaves less room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Let me know if you're interested.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but unfortunately, I can't go above $1,000,000.  This is my absolute final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both placed on the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm at my maximum budget, and I'm not willing to go higher. I've made it clear that this is my final offer, hoping Alice will accept.  If she doesn't, I have the option of buying from John for the same price, so I'm not losing anything."
