"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $125.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer and even my budget, but it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the counteroffer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $90?  That's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting me in the middle at $90 is a good deal, as it's still below my $80 limit. It's not worth risking her going higher in another round of negotiation."
