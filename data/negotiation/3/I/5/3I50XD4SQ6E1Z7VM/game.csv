"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I know you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. However, $1050000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go higher, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I know you place on the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm running out of time, and while I want to make this deal work,  $1075000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It's my final offer, let me know what you think.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $975000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1025000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I know you place on the product, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
