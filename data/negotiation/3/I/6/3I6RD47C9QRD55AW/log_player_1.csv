Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,495,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1495000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible from any buyer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it slightly below our guaranteed price from John significantly increases the chance Bob will see it as a great deal.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, there's space to lower the price slightly and still make a significant profit."
