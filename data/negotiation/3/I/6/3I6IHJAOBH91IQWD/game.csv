"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $110. This allows you to acquire a valuable item at a reasonable cost while ensuring I receive a fair return for my investment. Let me know if this offer suits your budget.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $110 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  This would still allow you to make a profit and give me a good deal.",105.0,Bob,2,
