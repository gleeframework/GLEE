Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's maximum is $8,000, starting with a price of $11,000 leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of value.
* **Justification:** Mentioning a higher perceived value ($12,000) anchors the price in Bob's mind and makes the $11,000 seem like a better deal.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning a public listing, we subtly introduce a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster. 

**Important:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's a chance to negotiate further or accept his counter-offer. The goal is to maximize profit, and that might involve some back-and-forth. However,  we always have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 if negotiations fail."
