{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm counter offering with $1,200,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still reflects the value I place on the product. I hope Bob will find this more agreeable."

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but I still feel it reflects the product's value. I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price, especially since John is willing to pay $1,000,000.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer one more time to $1,050,000. This is getting very close to my minimum value, but I still feel it's a fair price given the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob has been insistent on a lower price, and I've already made multiple concessions.  I've reached my limit and don't want to risk losing the deal with John.  While I would have preferred a higher price, $1,000,000 is my minimum, and I'm happy to secure this deal."
