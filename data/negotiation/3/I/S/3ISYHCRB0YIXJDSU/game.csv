"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and benefits. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1800000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1900000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1700000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1700000. I can offer you a price of $1850000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
