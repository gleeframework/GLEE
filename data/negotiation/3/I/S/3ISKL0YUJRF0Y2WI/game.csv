"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product to me is quite significant and $800,000 falls short of what I'd be willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? I propose $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $900,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
