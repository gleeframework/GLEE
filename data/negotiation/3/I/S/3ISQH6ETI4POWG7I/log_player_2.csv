{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $9,500 is a good starting point, but I can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm also pushing for a good deal."

Alice has moved slightly closer to my price, but it's still not quite where I want to be.  I'm going to counter again to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still going to try for a lower price. I'm confident I can get a deal below $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8950}
```

I'm getting closer to Alice's price, but still pushing for a bit more of a discount.  We're almost at a point where a deal might be possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Alice's offer again.  We're very close, but I'm confident I can get it down to $9,000 or just below."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

This is my final push. I'm going to offer $9,000, which is only slightly higher than my previous offer.  If Alice rejects this, I'll go with John's offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get much lower than Alice's current offer, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a better deal than continuing to negotiate and risk getting no product at all."
