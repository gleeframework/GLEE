"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'd like to start with this offer.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
