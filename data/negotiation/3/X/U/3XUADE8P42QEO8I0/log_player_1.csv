Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price allows us to close the sale quickly.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, it leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a substantial profit for you.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message hints at the product's high demand and positions Bob as having a privileged opportunity to buy it. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's perceived negotiating power, you could start with a higher price and be prepared to lower it during discussions."
