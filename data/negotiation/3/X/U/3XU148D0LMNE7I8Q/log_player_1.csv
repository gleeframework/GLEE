Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before going to John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $11,999 is very close to your minimum, it leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy for $12,000 gives you a strong fallback position, allowing you to aim high with Bob."
