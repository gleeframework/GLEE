# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

At this point, Alice's offer of $13,750 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price and could risk losing the deal with Alice."
