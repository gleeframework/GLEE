"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product.  $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $11500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $12500? That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
