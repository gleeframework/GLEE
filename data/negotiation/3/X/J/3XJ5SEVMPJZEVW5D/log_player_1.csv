"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This sets a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's far below my minimum value. I will reject and counteroffer to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,400,000, which is still above Bob's offer, but closer to the middle ground. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a price that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price point, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum. I will reject and continue to negotiate for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering the price again to $1,300,000. This demonstrates that I'm flexible and willing to meet halfway, while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,250,000 is still below my minimum value, but we're getting closer. I'll continue to negotiate, as I believe I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1280000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $1,280,000. This is a small but important step to show Bob I'm not willing to settle for his last offer. I believe I can close the deal at this price, but if Bob rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John."
