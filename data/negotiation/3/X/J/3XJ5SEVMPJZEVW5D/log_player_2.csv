"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's no reason to accept it.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always fall back on buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay.  Alice knows I have another option with John, so I'm hoping she'll see the value in closing the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to continue negotiating to try to get a better deal.  There's still a chance she might come down further, and I want to explore those options before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still keeping it below the $1,400,000 Alice is offering. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to buy from her.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better deal. There are still a few rounds left, and I might be able to push her down even further.  It's a gamble, but I'm not ready to commit to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but just slightly to $1,250,000. This shows that I'm still serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher.  Alice is clearly getting closer to my budget, and I think this offer will push her to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, it's getting very close.  I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the product.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and at $1,280,000, it's a reasonable price to pay.  It's better to close the deal now and secure the product than to risk losing it and having to pay John $1,000,000."
