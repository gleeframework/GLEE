Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice, along with the offer:

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob sees the product as worth $800,000.
* **Alice's Safety Net:**  Alice knows she can sell the product for $800,000 to John. This is her ""walk-away"" price.
* **Aiming High:** Alice should start with an offer higher than $800,000. There's a chance Bob is willing to pay a premium to secure the product. 

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $875,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confidence:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Premium Pricing:** The $75,000 markup is significant but not outrageous. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Clear Intent:** The offer is direct and leaves no ambiguity about Alice's desired price. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Alice's minimum acceptable price is $800,000.
* **Market Information:**  If Alice had more information about Bob's needs or the market demand for this product, she could adjust her strategy. However, with the information given, this offer balances risk and potential reward."
