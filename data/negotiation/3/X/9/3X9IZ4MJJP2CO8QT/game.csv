,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $140, so I'll offer you the product for $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget at $160. Would you be willing to go down to $145? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'll offer you the product for $155, which is a compromise between our previous discussions.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is my absolute maximum budget. If you can meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a purchase.",150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to sell the product for $150, as it's below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $160, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",160.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $160. I'm willing to meet you at $152, which is still below your previous offer of $160. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",152.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $160, and I'm not willing to meet you at $152. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll sell the product to you for $157.50, which is a compromise between our previous discussions.",157.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm really at the limit of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from another seller.",155.0,Bob,10,
