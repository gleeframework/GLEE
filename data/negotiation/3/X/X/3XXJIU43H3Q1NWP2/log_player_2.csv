# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. John offers the product at Bob's desired price, making it the most advantageous option."
