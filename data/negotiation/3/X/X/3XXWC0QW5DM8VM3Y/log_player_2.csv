{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $19,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a compromise. Would you consider $16,500? This is a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $16,500 is still outside my maximum. I'm confident I can negotiate further and potentially get a better price. I want to see if I can convince Alice to come down even more."
