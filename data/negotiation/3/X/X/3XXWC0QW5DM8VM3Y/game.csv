"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $19,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a compromise. Would you consider $16,500? This is a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your compromise, $16,500 is still above my limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.",13250.0,Bob,6,
