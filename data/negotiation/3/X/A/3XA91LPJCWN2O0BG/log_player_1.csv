{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth significantly more.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer gives Bob a significant discount while still leaving you with a very profitable sale.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the deal, while also highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only commit to a maximum of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, it is still significantly below the product's value to Bob and my own minimum.  I will counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, recognizing the value you see in the product. This price still allows for a very profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and am willing to consider a price closer to your asking point. However, given my budget constraints, I can only commit to $1250000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what John is offering and is close to my minimum acceptable price.  This deal allows me to secure a good profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation or a potential deadlock."
