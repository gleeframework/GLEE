"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I have the chance to get a better price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still negotiate down in subsequent rounds.
* **Ensure a backup:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $80, guaranteeing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since I have 8 rounds left. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** I can demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product.
* **Potentially get a better price:** By counter-offering, I might be able to get closer to my target price of $80 or even higher.
* **Gather more information:** Bob's offer gives me a clearer idea of his perceived value for the product, which will help me craft a more strategic counter-offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll use the information from Bob's offer and the remaining rounds to formulate a counter-offer that balances my desire for a higher price with the need to reach a deal before time runs out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm starting the counter-offer by meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $75 and my initial price of $100. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value for Bob by stating it's still a ""good deal"" at $85.  
* **Maintaining Profit:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, so I'm not giving away too much.

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Close the gap:** By narrowing the price difference, I increase the likelihood of a deal in the next round.
* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:** This counter-offer shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain my position:** I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm also willing to compromise to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $80? I'm really hoping to close this deal today, and I think $80 is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal considering:

* **Meeting my minimum:** This offer ensures I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Time is ticking:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's important to secure a deal. 
* **Equal value:**  Bob seems to be happy with the price, which suggests it's fair to both of us.

By accepting Bob's offer, I:

* **Maximize my earnings:** While not ideal, it's the best outcome given the remaining rounds.
* **Avoid further negotiation:** This ends the negotiation and ensures I don't risk losing the deal.
* **Guarantee a profit:**  It's better to sell at my minimum price than to risk losing the deal and needing to sell to John at the same price."
