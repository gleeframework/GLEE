,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $80? I'm really hoping to close this deal today, and I think $80 is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
