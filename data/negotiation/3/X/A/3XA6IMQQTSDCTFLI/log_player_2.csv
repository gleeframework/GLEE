"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate. Rejecting Alice's initial offer opens the door for a counteroffer and potential price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $75 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  This shows Alice that you're serious about getting the product but also signals that you're willing to negotiate. This initial counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $85 is better than her initial $100, it's still higher than your ideal price point. It's worth pushing for a further price reduction, as you have more negotiation rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $80? I'm really hoping to close this deal today, and I think $80 is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway, while still pushing for a price closer to your ideal. It's a reasonable compromise that leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it again."
