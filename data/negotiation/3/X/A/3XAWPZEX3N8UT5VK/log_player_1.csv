Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. However, I'm open to discussing a figure that works best for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,300,000 vs. $800,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), there's room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if you started lower.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the high price, without revealing your hand or John's offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The language emphasizes a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial deal, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, aiming for the highest possible price with Bob first maximizes your potential profit."
