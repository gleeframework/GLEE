"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value of $15,000. This will give me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time, so I'm not overly concerned about losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired amount. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to $16,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still feel I can get more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to consider selling to John. This negotiation is getting close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to make my final counteroffer at $15,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept.  I'm getting close to my limit with John and don't want to lose too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, his offers keep coming in lower than my minimum, and I'm worried I'll be stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my needs.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'm running out of time."
