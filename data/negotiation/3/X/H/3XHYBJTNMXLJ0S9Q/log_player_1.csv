Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price. Would you be interested in buying it for $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I want to maximize my profit, so I aim for a price as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Negotiation Buffer:** Offering $120 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It's a good starting point for a potential win-win.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John's offer of $80 provides a floor price. I won't accept anything lower than that."
