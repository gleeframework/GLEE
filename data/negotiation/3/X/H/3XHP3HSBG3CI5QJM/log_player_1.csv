Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Higher than Bob's Value:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but it's still a ""deal"" compared to your guaranteed sale to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the sale goes through."
