"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000.
