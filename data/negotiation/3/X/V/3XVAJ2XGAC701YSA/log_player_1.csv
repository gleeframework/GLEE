{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. It allows for some room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is still a good deal, it's below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. She's willing to continue negotiations with Bob, hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
