"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm not willing to accept that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I want to see if we can find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not happy with the price. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob has finally offered my minimum value. While I would have liked to get more, I'm happy with the price, especially since we're already on round 6. It's time to close the deal."
