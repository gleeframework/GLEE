"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1300000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to maneuver since you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1325000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1275000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1290000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,290,000 is within your budget and a decent price, considering you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to her. It's a good compromise, and you'll save $60,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that if you reject, Alice might walk away, and you'd be stuck buying from John at a higher price. Accepting her offer secures the product at a fair price."
