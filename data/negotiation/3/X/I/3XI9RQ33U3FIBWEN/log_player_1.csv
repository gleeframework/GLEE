Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly greeting and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob. Offering $120 is a good starting point - it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is lower than my preferred price, but still higher than selling to John. I will counter with a higher offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  This price still leaves room for you to get a great deal, while allowing me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 110}
