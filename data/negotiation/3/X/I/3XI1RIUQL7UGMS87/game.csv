"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll need to add a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $11500. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and my previous offer of $10500. Can we try $11000 again?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to $11000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to prioritize my minimum price.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional value you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and my previous offer of $10500. Can we try $11250 again?",11250.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11250. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $11750. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and look elsewhere. I appreciate your time and effort, but I think I'll have to go with John's offer of $15000.",15000.0,Bob,10,
