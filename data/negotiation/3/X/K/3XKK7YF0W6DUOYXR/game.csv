"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,300,000. This still gives you a good deal, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I'm trying to work within a tighter budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
