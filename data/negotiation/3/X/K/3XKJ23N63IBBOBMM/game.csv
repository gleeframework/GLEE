"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
