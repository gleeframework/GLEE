Let's see how Bob responds to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm putting a firm stance with this offer, making it clear this is my final offer.  This creates a sense of urgency while still allowing for a potential agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to counter your offer at $925,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob is clearly very interested and is steadily increasing his offer. Accepting $925,000 is a good deal and avoids the risk of pushing him away by further haggling."
