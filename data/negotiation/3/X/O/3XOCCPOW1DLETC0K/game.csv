"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $140.  It's a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable going all the way down to $140, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
