Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product at my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This is a high price, but it's worth testing the waters and seeing if Bob is willing to pay it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $120. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is still above Bob's value, but it's closer to his offer and may be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $102 is still too low, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further rounds of negotiation that might end in a lower price."
