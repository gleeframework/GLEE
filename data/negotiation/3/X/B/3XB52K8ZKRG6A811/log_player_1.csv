Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  This is a great deal, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $9,500 price gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Attractive Offer:**  The price is still attractive to Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value, making him more likely to consider accepting.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm keeping John in mind. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I can purchase it elsewhere for slightly more. Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has acknowledged the product's value. This indicates a willingness to negotiate, and there's still potential for a compromise. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is still an option if negotiations with Bob fail completely. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still leaves you a decent margin. Let's meet halfway!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Attractive Price:** $9,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's closer to my target.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a rationale for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** My message uses a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
