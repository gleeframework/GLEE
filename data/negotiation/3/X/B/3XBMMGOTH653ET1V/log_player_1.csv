Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Reservation Price:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above his valuation. 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price point signals that we understand the product's value but are also open to making a deal with Bob.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, having John as a backup buyer provides us with a strong negotiating position."
