"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I think it's a fair deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It's always best to secure the lowest possible price."
