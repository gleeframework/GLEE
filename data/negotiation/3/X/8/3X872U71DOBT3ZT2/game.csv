"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low for me.  It's a valuable product and I believe it's worth more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's close this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's finalize this deal now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
