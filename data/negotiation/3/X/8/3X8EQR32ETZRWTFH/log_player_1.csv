Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation but also making it clear I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. How about $108? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, but $108 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 111} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure a sale."
