"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $120. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction, with you getting a valuable item at a reasonable price and me earning more than the cost of the product. Please let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though you value the product at $150, Alice is offering it for $120. 
* **You're getting a good deal:**  You're paying less than your valuation, which means you're getting a good deal.
* **It's better to accept than risk losing the product:** If you reject Alice's offer, you'll have to buy from John at a higher price."
