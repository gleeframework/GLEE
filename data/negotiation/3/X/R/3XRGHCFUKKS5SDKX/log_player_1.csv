Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to part with it for $99. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 makes it appealing to Bob (as it's less than his perceived value) while still netting me a higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The slightly higher price leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, further maximizing potential profit."
