Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, but still secures a significant profit above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

This strategy balances maximizing my potential gain while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
