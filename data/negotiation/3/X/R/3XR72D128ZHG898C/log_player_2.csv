(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price will give you room to negotiate. This initial offer is a strong signal that you're serious about buying, but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget, but it's closer. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to $1,150,000, which is still lower than Alice's offer but demonstrates a willingness to compromise. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, even though it's closer to my maximum budget. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000, so I'm not going to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again to $1,250,000. This is closer to Alice's last offer and is only a small increase from my maximum budget. This shows a willingness to compromise but still emphasizes that I'm not willing to go much higher."
