"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. This ensures I'm not losing money but also gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is still below my desired profit margin, but it's closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about $95? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's a good step closer to what I'm hoping for."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $95, hoping to meet Bob halfway. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to get the best price I can.  $90 is the highest I'm willing to go. If you can't meet that, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and the negotiation seems to be stuck. Continuing to reject Bob's offer risks him walking away completely, and I'd be forced to sell to John for $80. It's better to secure the $90 now."
