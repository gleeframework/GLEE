"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we work something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950,000, which is still a good discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
