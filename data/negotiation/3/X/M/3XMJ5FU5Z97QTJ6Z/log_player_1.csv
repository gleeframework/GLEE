Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 just wouldn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm confident this product is worth it to you, and this price is still a great deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 115}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
