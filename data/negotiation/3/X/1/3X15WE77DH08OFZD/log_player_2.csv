It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $90."

I'm offering $85, which is a good compromise between your $80 valuation and my maximum budget of $100.  Let's see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway!"

Alice's offer is a bit higher than my previous counteroffer, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget."

I'm offering $88, which is still a bit less than Alice's latest offer, but closer to my maximum budget. This shows I'm serious about buying from her, but still want a good deal."

Alice is becoming more stubborn, and the price is getting closer to my maximum budget. At this point, it's better to buy from John.  It's a sure thing, and it saves the hassle of further negotiation."
