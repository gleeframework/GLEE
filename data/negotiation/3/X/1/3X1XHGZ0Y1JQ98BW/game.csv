"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
