"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
