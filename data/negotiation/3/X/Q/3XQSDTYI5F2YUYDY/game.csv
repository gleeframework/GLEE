"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider selling it to me for that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $10,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know your thoughts!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I've reviewed your latest offer, Alice. While I'm interested in purchasing your product, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between at $9,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $9,000 is a step in the right direction. However, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be open to considering $11,000? This would be a significant investment for you, but it would also ensure you get a top-tier product that will deliver long-term value.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your persistence and for considering my budget constraints. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000. I believe this price reflects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable and brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $10,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap with $11,500.  This would allow me to move forward with the sale while still giving you a great deal on a product that's sure to provide significant value.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
