Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** This allows for further negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer.
* **Safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

By starting with a higher price and allowing for counteroffers, I maximize my chances of getting closer to my desired price point while still maintaining flexibility in case the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider selling it to me for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does demonstrate his interest in the product. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the leverage to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.

**Next steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, but I will not accept anything below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $10,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight that $10,000 still represents a great value for Bob.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I reiterate my willingness to negotiate, leaving the door open for further discussion.

* **Keep the conversation going:** I want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process to maximize the chance of finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've reviewed your latest offer, Alice. While I'm interested in purchasing your product, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between at $9,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
