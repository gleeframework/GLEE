"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
