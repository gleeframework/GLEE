{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to come down to $875,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  
* There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a lower price.
* Buying from John is an option, but Bob wants to save as much as possible, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is the better strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $860,000. This is a fair price that would allow us both to close the deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 860000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $880,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price.
* Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice might walk away. 
* Accepting the offer at $880,000 secures the product at a price that's still significantly lower than what John is offering ($1,000,000).
* Given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's a good strategy to accept a reasonable offer and avoid the risk of losing out entirely."
