{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $14,250? This price is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14250}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $14,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's close to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal entirely."
