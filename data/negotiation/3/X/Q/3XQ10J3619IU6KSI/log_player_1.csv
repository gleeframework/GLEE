Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still looking for a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $12,000 as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, he's firmly stuck at $12,000. It's unlikely he'll go higher. Since John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, it's strategically better to take the sure thing and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
