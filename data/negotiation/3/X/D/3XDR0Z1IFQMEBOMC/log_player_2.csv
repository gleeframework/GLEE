"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and functionality of your business operations. Given its exceptional quality and the unique benefits it offers, I am confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Considering its intrinsic worth and the benefits it provides, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at an exclusive price of $14,000. This price reflects a strategic midpoint between its market value and my cost, aiming to provide a fair deal for both parties while maximizing my earnings. I look forward to your positive response and the potential to strengthen our business relationship through this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 less than your maximum budget and significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000). By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice.  While you could buy from John for $15,000, there's still room to try and get a lower price from Alice."
