"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11750 is getting closer, I'm still looking to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value we've both discussed. I'm confident this can work for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
