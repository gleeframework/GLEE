"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer it at this price again. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a good price, it's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a significant difference between Alice's offer and the price you're willing to pay from John.  By rejecting the offer, you can explore if Alice is willing to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11750. This is a one-time compromise, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation.  The price is still significantly higher than my ideal price of $10,000. I'm willing to go a little higher, but not that high.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get closer to my target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,750 is getting closer, I'm still looking to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value we've both discussed. I'm confident this can work for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $11900. This is my final offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,900, which is just $900 above my last counteroffer of $11,000.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $11,000,  I'm getting closer to my ideal price and it's possible Alice won't budge further. It's getting close to the price I'd pay from John, and I'm confident I can get a good value from this product. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
