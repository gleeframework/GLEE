"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm starting at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, giving Bob some room to negotiate.  I'm also being friendly and open to his response, which will help build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm confident I can push for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's come up to $125, which is a fair price for both of us. It's closer to my initial asking price and above my minimum threshold.  Further negotiation might be possible, but with limited rounds and John's offer as a fallback, it's not worth risking a lower price."
