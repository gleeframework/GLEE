This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground on this figure.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While you could continue negotiating, it's getting risky. You've already had 6 rounds, and you only have 4 left.  Since John is offering the product for your maximum budget, it's safer to buy from John and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
