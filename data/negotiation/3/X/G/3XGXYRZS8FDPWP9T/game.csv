"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's worth to you and my own budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This would still be a profitable sale for you and allows me to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is a significant offer, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true worth. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This compromise allows for a fair deal for both of us and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows for a successful transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
