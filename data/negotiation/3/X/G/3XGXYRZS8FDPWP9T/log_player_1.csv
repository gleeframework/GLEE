Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's worth to you and my own budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This would still be a profitable sale for you and allows me to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know your thoughts.
