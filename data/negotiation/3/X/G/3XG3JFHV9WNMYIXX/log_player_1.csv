Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,700,000? I believe this is a fair offer, considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still very far apart on price.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. To make this work, I can go up to $750,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While negotiating with Bob might eventually lead to a higher offer, his counteroffers are escalating too slowly.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer is the most time-efficient and guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
