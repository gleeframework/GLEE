"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,700,000? I believe this is a fair offer, considering the significant benefits you'll gain.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still very far apart on price.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. To make this work, I can go up to $750,000. That's my final offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
