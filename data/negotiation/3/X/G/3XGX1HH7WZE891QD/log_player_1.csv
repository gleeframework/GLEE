Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification of value:** While not explicitly stating its worth to you, the message implies the product is valuable, potentially justifying the high price to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  A more nuanced approach might involve multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
