"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your limit and John's price. You should definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin with a significantly lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and hopefully meet somewhere closer to your desired range. 
* **Gauging Alice's Position:** This low offer will give you an idea of Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down significantly, it might be worth continuing negotiations. If she holds firm, you have the option to walk away and go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $8,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider $13,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice came down a bit, the new offer is still too high and not that far off from her original price. 
* **John is an Option:** You have a reliable alternative with John at $10,000, so you're not desperate to accept a bad deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By rejecting, you signal to Alice that you're serious about a lower price and encourage her to make further concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I could go up to $9,500. That's a fair offer, considering I can get it for $10,000 elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But Below Limit:**  You've raised your offer to show flexibility but kept it below your $10,000 limit.
* **Introducing John:** By mentioning John's offer, you create a sense of urgency for Alice. She knows you have another option and might be more willing to compromise to close the deal.
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** This offer will show how eager Alice is to sell to you specifically. If she's unwilling to budge much further, it might be time to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is getting closer, $11,250 is still above your $10,000 budget. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:** You have a standing offer from John that's better than Alice's current price.
* **Final Push:** One more rejection might signal to Alice that you're serious about your budget and she needs to come down further if she wants to make the sale."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. I appreciate you coming down, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make my final offer at $10,000. That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price given the market.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you're setting a clear boundary and letting Alice know you're serious.
* **Matching John:**  You're meeting your absolute limit, which is equivalent to John's offer. 
* **Decision Time:**  This forces Alice to make a choice: accept a slightly lower price than she wanted or risk losing the sale altogether."
