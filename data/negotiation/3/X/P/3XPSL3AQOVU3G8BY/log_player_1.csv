Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $800,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's a good chance he'll accept. However, if he rejects, you have room to lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is more than your minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your desired $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for you, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept, especially if he's eager to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like to get for the product. Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer gives you the chance to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It's closer to Bob's price, but still gives you a significant profit. You're pushing for a deal, while leaving some room for negotiation. This could be the final offer, or it could lead to another round of counteroffers, depending on how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, the negotiations have gone on for a while, and it seems Bob is not willing to go any higher. While $900,000 is still a decent profit, selling to John for $800,000 ensures a guaranteed sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
