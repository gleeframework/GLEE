Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your position, but I am still unable to meet above $8,000 for the product. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price?

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firm on his $8,000 offer. It's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures the same price John is offering."
