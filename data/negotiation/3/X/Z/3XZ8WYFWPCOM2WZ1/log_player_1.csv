Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth every penny! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately going to John.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and making it sound like a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $120 I can get from John. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Maintaining bargaining power:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and shows I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  It's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product while being open to negotiation.
* **Leaving room for agreement:** $110 is still above my minimum of $120, allowing for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum but still below:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject his offer and counteroffer again, there's no guarantee he'll accept, and the negotiation could go on indefinitely. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk and uncertainty of further negotiations."
