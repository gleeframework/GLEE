We're getting close, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice is coming down, and we want to encourage that trend without settling for a price higher than John's offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $80 now.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
