"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. As we value your business, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $11,250 offer gets you the product for a price significantly lower than John's $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result, and you risk Alice withdrawing the offer altogether."
