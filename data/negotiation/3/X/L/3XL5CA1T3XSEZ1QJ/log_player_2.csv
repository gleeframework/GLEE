"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.**
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.** 
* **Buying from John right now would be a worse option as Alice might be willing to sell for less.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $15,000.**
* **While her offer is closer to your desired price, you're still better off trying to negotiate further.**
* **Buying from John now would be a worse option as Alice might be willing to come down further.**"
