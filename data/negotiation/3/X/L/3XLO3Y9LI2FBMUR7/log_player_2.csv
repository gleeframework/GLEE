{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  $90 is too high, and you can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2

{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's closer to Alice's value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation."

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and it's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

This is a final counteroffer, closer to Alice's price, but still within your budget.  It shows you're serious about buying the product, but won't go higher. If Alice rejects this, it's time to consider buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at $100, as that's still within your budget and saves you the hassle of further negotiation."
