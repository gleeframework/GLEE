"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $750000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not comfortable with $750000. I'm willing to come down a little further to $850000. This is a significant price for me, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $850000, so I'll offer $800000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
