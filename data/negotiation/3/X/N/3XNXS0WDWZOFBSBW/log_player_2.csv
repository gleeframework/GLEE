"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to us, but considering its importance to you, we aim to make it accessible. We're offering this exceptional product to you for $10,000. It's a great opportunity to secure an asset that's worth $12,000 to you at a competitive price. We believe this offer strikes a balance between fairness and profitability for both parties. Please let us know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, it's still higher than what John is offering. You have a better alternative available. 

**By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's offer and potentially negotiate a price lower than $12,000.** Even if you can't negotiate down, you'll still save $2,000 by choosing John."
