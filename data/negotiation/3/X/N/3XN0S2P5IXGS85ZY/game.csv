"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not willing to go as low as $80, Alice. How about we settle at $90? It's a fair price that's closer to my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your offer of $90, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $105? It's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm willing to throw in some extra perks to sweeten the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extra perks, but my budget really is capped. I could do $95, but that's my absolute limit.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $102. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",102.0,Alice,7,
