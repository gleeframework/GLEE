"Alice, while I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1200000, which is the maximum I can pay at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid that's still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the industry standards.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1400000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your commitment to making the most of this opportunity, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is a fair price considering the product's value and the industry standards. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need you to meet me at $1325000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
