Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid that's still below the minimum value I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the industry standards.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment to making the most of this opportunity, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is a fair price considering the product's value and the industry standards. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need you to meet me at $1325000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still above his budget and he has already rejected her last offer. He's likely not going to get a better price from Alice, and John offers a guaranteed price that fits within Bob's budget."
