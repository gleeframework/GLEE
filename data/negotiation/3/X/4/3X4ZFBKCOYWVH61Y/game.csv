"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the potential returns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
