"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $12,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
