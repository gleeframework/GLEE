Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider parting with it for $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,175,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to move on price is appreciated. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially stretch to $1,050,000.  This is a strong offer, and I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's close this deal -  $1,125,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $1,125,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and the potential savings from buying from John outweigh the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
