"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It holds significant value, and I believe it can be of great benefit to you. My asking price is $1400000. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to her. You can potentially negotiate a better price. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $1250000 doesn't quite cover the true worth of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offering. How about $1350000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still within your budget, and it's closer to your initial counteroffer. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and ultimately buying from John at $1,500,000 is too high. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price you're comfortable with."
