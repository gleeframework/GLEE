"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $1,250,000 doesn't quite cover the true worth of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offering. How about $1,350,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
