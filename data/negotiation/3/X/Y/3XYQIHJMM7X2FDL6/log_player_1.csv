Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. Here's the reasoning:

* **Minimum Value:**  I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Potential Upside:**  I'm hoping Bob values the product even more than $1,500,000. If he does, he'll accept my offer, and I'll make a bigger profit.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

This strategy balances my desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale."
