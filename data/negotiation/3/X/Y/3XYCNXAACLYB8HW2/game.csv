"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Could we possibly negotiate down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about $110? That's still a great price, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $105 is closer, I'm still a little ways off from my target.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $112.50?  That way, we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
