Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,999,999.  Given its potential, I believe this is a more than fair price."",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to start with an ambitious offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and Bob's potential return, I'm attempting to justify the high price. 
* **Negotiation room:** This initial offer leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters. It allows me to potentially secure a price significantly higher than my minimum.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm not losing anything. I can always negotiate down or sell to John at my guaranteed price."
