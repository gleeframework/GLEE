"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $100 is quite low, but I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $170 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could we do $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can't go as low as $110, but to be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $150 and we have a deal?",150.0,Alice,5,
