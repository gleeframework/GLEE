Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers excellent value, but let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 14500 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John), I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to my valuation. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $14,500 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to be inviting and encourages Bob to engage in discussion, even if he's not immediately sold on the price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John at $15,000.  There's no opportunity to go back to Bob."
