Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This incentivizes Bob to accept, as he knows he's getting a good deal.
* **It allows for potential counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price of $800,000, and even lower than your initial offer of $950,000.  It's not in your best interest to accept it. By rejecting his offer, you can continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that far. I'm offering $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still being attractive to you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While $875,000 is a reasonable suggestion, I still believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that satisfies both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $800,000 and only slightly lower than your previous counteroffer of $875,000. Accepting this offer is the best strategy in this situation. You'll be able to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at a lower price."
