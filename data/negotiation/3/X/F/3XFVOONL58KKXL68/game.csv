"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that far. I'm offering $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still being attractive to you. Let's find a middle ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While $875,000 is a reasonable suggestion, I still believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that satisfies both our interests.",825000.0,Bob,4,
