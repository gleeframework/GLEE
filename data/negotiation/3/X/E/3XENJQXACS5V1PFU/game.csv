"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price of $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,225,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price allows for a fair return for you while staying within my financial constraints.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
