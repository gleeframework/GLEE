"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm not sure $150 is within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $130, which is a good middle ground. Let me know if that works for you!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That way we can both get a good deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",135.0,Alice,5,
