I'm willing to come down to $7500, which is still a fair price given the value you've placed on it. Let's try to find a middle ground.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $6000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",6000.0,Bob,4,
