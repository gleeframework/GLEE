"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that high.  $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I pay $11,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $11000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11250.  This would be a fair compromise and a good value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is still below your maximum price of $12,000 and closer to your desired price. Accepting this offer saves you $750 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal, and it's likely Alice won't budge much more."
