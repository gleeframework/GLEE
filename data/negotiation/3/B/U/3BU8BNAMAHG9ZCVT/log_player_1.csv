``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that John's offer of $800,000 is your safety net, so you have leverage to decline counteroffers that are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept $700,000, it's better to hold out for a higher price.  John's offer of $800,000 provides a safety net, so I can afford to reject Bob's low offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far off from that number.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. Remember, John is still waiting in the wings, so I'm not desperate to close a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low. Let's compromise at $825,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
