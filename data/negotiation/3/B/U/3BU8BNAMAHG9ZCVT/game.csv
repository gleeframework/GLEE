"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for us both.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far off from that number.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low. Let's compromise at $825,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
