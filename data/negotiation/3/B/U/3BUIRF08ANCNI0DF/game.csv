"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155? It's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is a bit low, but $155 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $142.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to make a deal.",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $142.50 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $148.75.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it.",148.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $148.75. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,6,
