"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a high point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a reference point that may make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Confidence:**  A strong initial offer conveys confidence in the value of your product.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still substantially lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate and explore if Bob is willing to go higher. Accepting now would leave a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, my original price reflects the significant value this product offers.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While you rejected Bob's offer, you acknowledge his willingness to negotiate by making a sizable counter-concession (dropping $400,000). This signals that you are willing to find a deal.
* **Staying Above Target:** The new price of $1,900,000 keeps you significantly above both your minimum acceptable price and Bob's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** You re-emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further. My new offer is $1,600,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While you might be able to negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob, there's a risk he could walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
