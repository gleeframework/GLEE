Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While that's a significant difference from my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,125,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Could we settle on $1,000,000?  That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum.  Selling to John ensures I receive the full value I place on the product."
