Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price of $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While you could aim for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might reject it. This offer balances the potential for higher profit with the certainty of selling to John for $80."
