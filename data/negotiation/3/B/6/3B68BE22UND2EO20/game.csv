"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $180. I think that's a fair price for the product's value.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $180 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",150.0,Bob,4,
