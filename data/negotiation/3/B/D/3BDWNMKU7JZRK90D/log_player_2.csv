"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to get the product for $8,000 or less, and $12,000 is too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could get it from John for $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is simply not enough. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This gives you a great deal, and it's still a reasonable price for me.  Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,500 is closer to your target, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a fair compromise.  This gives you a decent profit, and I get the product at a price that's within my budget.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this figure. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to your target, it's still not ideal. You are still within your 10 rounds, so it's better to continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can reach a price closer to your target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could get it from John for $8,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $9750 still isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair compromise, and it keeps us both happy. It's a solid price for both of us, and it's time to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is stuck at $10,000, and you're only willing to go up to $9,750.  You've already gone through 7 rounds of negotiation, and you're running out of time.  It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $8,000 to avoid potentially reaching the 10th round and being forced to accept Alice's offer at $10,000."
