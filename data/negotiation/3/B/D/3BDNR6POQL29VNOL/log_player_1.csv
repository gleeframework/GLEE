Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a strong starting point. It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he has a significant incentive to negotiate, but it's also a price that demonstrates my confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can secure a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still maintaining a substantial profit margin. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while keeping my target price within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now within a reasonable range. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and a profit that exceeds my minimum threshold.  Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk of losing the deal entirely."
