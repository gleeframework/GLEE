You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the price lower by making a counteroffer.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  It is still a fair price for Alice considering she values the product at $800,000.  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation but also demonstrates your seriousness in making a deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price.  While it is a lower price than her initial offer, it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate further.  There's a good chance I can push the price down closer to my target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's latest offer and my previous offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still remaining within a price range that is beneficial to me. It also leaves room for Alice to make a slight concession if she's truly motivated to make a deal."
