"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
