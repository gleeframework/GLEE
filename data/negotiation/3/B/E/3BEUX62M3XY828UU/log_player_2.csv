"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are 7 rounds remaining, which gives you more time to try to reach an agreement within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
