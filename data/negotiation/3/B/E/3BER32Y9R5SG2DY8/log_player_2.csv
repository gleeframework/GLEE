"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $110. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $110. This is a good deal, but you can potentially get it for less.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a little more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go. Is that more to your liking? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $108.**  This is within your budget of $120.
* **Rejecting and counteroffering again risks further negotiation and potentially a stalemate.**  Alice has shown she's willing to come down, but may be firm on this price.
* **Buying from John for $120 is more expensive than Alice's offer.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option at this point."
