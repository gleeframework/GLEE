"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget.  This product is good, but not that good. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $12,000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to move up to $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, I can't go below $10,000 for this product. It's a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
