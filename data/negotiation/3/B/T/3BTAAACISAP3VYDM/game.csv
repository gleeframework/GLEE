"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move forward, I can consider a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential for a significant return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price point.  However, to be candid, $950,000 is still a significant gap from where I see this product's value. To be fair to us both, I can accept no less than $1,600,000. This is a firm offer on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you holding firm, but that price is still too high for me.  If you're willing to meet me halfway from our previous offers, I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,275,000. This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
