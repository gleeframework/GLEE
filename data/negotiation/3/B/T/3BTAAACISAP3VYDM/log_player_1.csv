"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price significantly higher than your desired minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Anchoring:**  By opening with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if the final price is lower, it's likely to be influenced by this initial high number.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is about gathering information about Bob's willingness to pay. His response will provide valuable insights for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($1,500,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss.  It's early in the negotiation, and there's room to work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move forward, I can consider a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential for a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:**  We're lowering the price substantially (from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage. However, the new price remains well above both your $1,500,000 minimum and John's offer. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and potential return on investment, we're aiming to justify a price point that is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation towards a middle ground. It encourages Bob to either raise his offer significantly or provide more justification for his lower valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, it's still significantly below your $1,500,000 safety net with John. There's no need to settle yet. You'll continue negotiating to see if you can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price point.  However, to be candid, $950,000 is still a significant gap from where I see this product's value. To be fair to us both, I can accept no less than $1,600,000. This is a firm offer on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** The message explicitly states this is a ""firm offer"" to signal to Bob you're nearing your bottom line.
* **Conceding Slightly:** The price of $1,600,000 is a concession, but it's still above your guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By round 5 out of 10, it's strategic to start applying some time pressure to encourage Bob to make a more substantial move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you holding firm, but that price is still too high for me.  If you're willing to meet me halfway from our previous offers, I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,275,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to Final Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is above your $1,250,000 absolute minimum. It's also very close to the middle ground between your last two offers, suggesting it's likely his best offer. 
* **""Final Offer"" & Time:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" adds weight to the proposition. With only four rounds remaining, the risk of him walking away increases.  
* **Solid Profit:**  Accepting this offer secures a significant profit, even if it's less than your ideal target. 
 
While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are likely outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
