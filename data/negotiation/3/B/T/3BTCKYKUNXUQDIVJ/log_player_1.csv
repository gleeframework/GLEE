This offer starts with a price higher than the minimum I need to get ($1,000,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to see a higher offer to accept."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $925,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely.  John is guaranteed to buy the product for my minimum price, so selling to him is the most secure and sensible option at this point."
