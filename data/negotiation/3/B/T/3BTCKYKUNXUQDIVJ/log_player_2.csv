"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a simple first step. Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You should definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to move upwards while still potentially securing a good deal.
* **Significant Difference:** A counteroffer of $800,000 creates a significant gap from Alice's initial offer. This might encourage her to negotiate more seriously rather than simply dismissing your counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer, you still have room to increase your offer (up to your $1,000,000 maximum) in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a possibility to negotiate a better price. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, as she lowered her initial offer.

You'll need to carefully consider your next counteroffer. You're getting closer to your limit, but pushing for a lower price might be worth the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to getting this deal done."", ""product_price"": 925000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $925,000 presents a compromise. It's a substantial increase from your previous offer, signaling to Alice that you're serious. 
* **Midpoint:** This price point sits directly in the middle of your last offer and her current offer, making it a psychologically appealing point for agreement.
* **Urgency:** While you still have room to negotiate, this counteroffer conveys a sense of urgency to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $925,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Difference:** Alice's offer is now only $25,000 away from John's price. 
* **Potential for Savings:** While the potential savings are smaller, it's still worth trying to negotiate a final time.  Alice might be willing to meet your price or at least get even closer to John's offer.

**It's now a question of how much risk you're willing to take.  Do you want to secure the deal now (even if it means paying slightly more than John's price), or do you want to gamble on one more counteroffer?**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer clearly communicates that this is your final offer.  It creates a sense of urgency for Alice to accept.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $950,000, you're splitting the difference between your last offer and her current offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Below John's Price:** This offer still keeps you below your alternative option of buying from John, allowing you to achieve some savings. 

**Outcome:**

Now, the ball is in Alice's court. She'll need to decide if she's willing to accept a slightly lower profit margin to close the deal or risk losing the sale altogether."
