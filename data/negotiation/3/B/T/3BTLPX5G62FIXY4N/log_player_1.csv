``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. By starting with a higher price, you leave yourself room to come down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum of $8,000. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures I can still get a good deal for my product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum of $8,000, and given that he might reject any further counteroffers, it's best to accept his offer of $8,750. This will guarantee a sale and a profit for me."
