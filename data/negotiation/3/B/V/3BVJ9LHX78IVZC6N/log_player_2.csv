"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** There's no immediate benefit to accepting.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in this product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable offer:** $125 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Be polite and enthusiastic:** Expressing interest keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Leave room for compromise:** There are still 9 rounds, so we can adjust the price if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $135 is less than your maximum of $150.
* **Alice has shown flexibility.** She's already moved down from her initial price.
* **There's potential for further negotiation.**  Even though you're accepting, there's always room to see if you can get a lower price in future rounds."
