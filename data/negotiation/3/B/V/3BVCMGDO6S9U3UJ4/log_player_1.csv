"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well outside my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,000,000. This reflects a considerable reduction on my initial offer and keeps it within a reasonable range of its true value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,000,000 remains a significant stretch for my budget.  To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we're still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate further and try to bring Bob closer to at least $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  While your offer is closer to what I have in mind, we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price reflects the significant value the product offers and represents a substantial compromise on my part."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $925,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in this product.  I'm eager to finalize the deal, so I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly increased his offer, and it's now well above John's guaranteed offer. Accepting $850,000 is a profitable outcome for us."
