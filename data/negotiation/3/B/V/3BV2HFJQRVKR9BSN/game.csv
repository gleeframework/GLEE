"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm on a budget and need to make some financial adjustments.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $700,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  To be frank, $700,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $850,000, but that's my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet your bottom line, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider alternative options, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,6,
