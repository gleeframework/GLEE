Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to meet your bottom line, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to consider alternative options, so I hope we can meet in the middle.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $750,000 offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk Bob walking away or engaging in further drawn-out negotiations."
