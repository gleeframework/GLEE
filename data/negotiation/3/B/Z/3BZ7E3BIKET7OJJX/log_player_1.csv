Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a strong price considering its potential. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and you to get a good deal. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the $1,500,000 from John."
