"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is still a strong price considering its potential. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and you to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
