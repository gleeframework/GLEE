You can do better than $120.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a better deal."

This offer is still within your budget and leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."

You're getting closer to your target price. This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving forward without risking going over your budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Alice is coming up to $130, which is still within your budget.  It's likely you won't be able to get a better deal, and it would be risky to continue and potentially have Alice walk away.  Let's accept the offer."
