Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, but still guarantees a significant profit even if he accepts the initial offer. 
* **Avoid Greed:**  While I could try for a price closer to $12,000,  being too greedy risks Bob rejecting the offer. It's better to secure a great deal than risk losing the sale altogether."
