"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its quality and features. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and John is offering the product at that price, it's the most logical choice to buy from John. There's no need to negotiate with Alice when you can get the product immediately at your desired price."
