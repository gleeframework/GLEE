Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate. If he seems genuinely interested but can't meet this price, I'll consider lowering it. However, I won't go below $1,750,000 before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's proposed price. I believe it shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a substantial profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll reassess my options, considering if I want to continue negotiating with him or simply sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation, as I'd only be risking losing the sale to John. Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation risks."
