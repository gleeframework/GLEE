"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as I believe it's worth more to you than that. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but $12,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I would like to propose $12,500 as a counteroffer. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also providing you with a fair return on your investment.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we go with $13,500?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. I am unable to meet you at $13,500. My maximum budget remains at $12,000. Could you consider coming down to this amount?",12000.0,Bob,6,
