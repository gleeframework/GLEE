"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,500. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
