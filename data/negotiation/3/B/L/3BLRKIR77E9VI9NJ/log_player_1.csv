Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is slightly above my minimum desired value of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $110 is the highest price I can realistically hope for, given Bob's perceived value.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By leaving the offer open-ended, I prompt Bob to counteroffer and potentially find a middle ground.
* **Maintain a good relationship:** A friendly tone ensures the negotiation doesn't become adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed profit, and I'm confident I can likely secure a better price from Bob with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price of $95, which is the midpoint between my last offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90).
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's point of view but reiterate my own need for a fair price. I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob to encourage acceptance.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a fair profit:** $95 still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By making a concrete counteroffer, I'm actively pursuing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm happy to negotiate, Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I've already shown flexibility, and it seems like further negotiation might not yield a better result. Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit and avoids further haggling with Bob."
