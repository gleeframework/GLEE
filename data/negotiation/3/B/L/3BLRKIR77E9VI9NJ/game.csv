,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,4,
