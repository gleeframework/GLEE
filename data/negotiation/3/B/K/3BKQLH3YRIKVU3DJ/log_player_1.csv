Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leave Bob room to counter:** Offering $120 doesn't mean that's the final price. If Bob counters with a lower offer, Alice can still negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Consider the ""walk-away"" price:** Alice knows she can get $80 from John, so any offer Bob makes above $80 is a profit. This knowledge gives Alice leverage. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $120. He might counter, or he might reject the offer outright. However, starting with a strong offer maximizes Alice's potential profit."
