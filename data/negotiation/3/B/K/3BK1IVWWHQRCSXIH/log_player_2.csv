"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far above Bob's budget. It makes sense to reject and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob starts with a significant counter-offer, aiming to get a much lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and could encourage Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price. Buying from John now would lock in a price within Bob's budget, but there's potential to save more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now in a more comfortable position. He has shown he's serious about buying and that he's willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's previous offer but still below his budget. The goal is to see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay. There are still rounds left, and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, making it worthwhile to see if he can push for a lower price.  He can potentially get closer to his target price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to his ideal price. This counteroffer is only $30,000 above his budget, demonstrating his commitment to buying the product. This might be enough to convince Alice to accept, but if not, there are still more rounds for negotiation."
