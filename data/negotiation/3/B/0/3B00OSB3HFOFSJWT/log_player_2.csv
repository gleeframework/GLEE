"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation and leaves little room for me to negotiate a better deal. It's worth seeing if I can get her price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation. This gives us room to negotiate and allows me to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message maintains a friendly tone while clearly stating my price target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your feedback. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $125 is still above her own valuation. I'm aiming to get the price closer to $115, which would be a fair compromise.  I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to see if I can achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $115? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $115 represents a compromise between my initial offer ($110) and Alice's current offer ($125). 
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message is brief and to the point, reiterating my desired price without being overly aggressive.
* **Sense of Urgency:** While I haven't explicitly stated a deadline, suggesting a ""fair price"" implies that I'm getting closer to considering other options if we can't reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested, Bob! Considering your last offer, how about we agree on $122 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $122 is a reasonable price, especially considering the time invested in the negotiation. It's unlikely I'll be able to get the price much lower without risking her accepting a deal from another buyer."
