Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum of $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I'm signaling to Bob that I'm open to negotiating by mentioning that I'm ""open to negotiation."" 
* **Encouraging Response:**  I'm asking Bob for his thoughts to prompt a response and start the conversation. 

**Note:**  This is just an initial offer. I will adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and aim to maximize my profit while keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I'm interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $110?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Encouraging Agreement:**  I'm aiming to reach a mutually agreeable price to avoid further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $125. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's a good deal considering:

* **Time:**  Further negotiation might prolong the process and increase the risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **John's Offer:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at $120, but Bob's offer is slightly higher.
* **Potential for Higher Offers:** While there's always a chance of getting a higher offer from Bob, it's not guaranteed, and the potential gain is minimal.

Therefore, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum."
