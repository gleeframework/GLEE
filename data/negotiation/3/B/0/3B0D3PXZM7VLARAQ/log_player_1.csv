Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth $150 to him, hinting at the potential for a good deal.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially start a conversation.

This approach aims to:

* Maximize my potential profit
* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate
* Keep the negotiation open and flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $90 is better than $80, it's still below my desired profit margin. There's a chance Bob is willing to pay more, especially since he's expressed interest in the product.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:**  Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to gauge how far he's willing to go.  He might be willing to budge a bit higher if he knows I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Maintaining Control:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and show I'm not easily swayed.

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. $90 is a bit lower than I hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit. It's a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not giving in entirely to Bob's offer.  A price of $105 still gives me a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, encouraging Bob to keep negotiating and find a solution we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $97.50 is very close to my desired profit margin. It's just a few dollars away from my initial offer, which was $120. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's always the risk that Bob might walk away completely or that I'll get stuck with the product. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale at a price that's very close to my target.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and could potentially lead to a lower price or even no sale at all. Accepting this offer is a good way to close the deal quickly."
