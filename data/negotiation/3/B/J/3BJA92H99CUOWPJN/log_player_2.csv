"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. I think you'll really love it and it's a great value at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is offering the product for $110. While it's a good deal, you can do better.  Rejecting the offer means you can get the product from John for $120, which is still within your budget."
