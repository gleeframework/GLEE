"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally very attached to, and it's worth at least $15,000 to me.  I understand it's worth $12,000 to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,
