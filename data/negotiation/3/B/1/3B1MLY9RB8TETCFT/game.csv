"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, the value of this product is truly exceptional.  I could consider parting with it for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,350,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,300,000. Can we meet at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
