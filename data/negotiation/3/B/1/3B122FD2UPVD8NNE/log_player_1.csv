Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Would you consider $9,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $9600 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I'd hoped, it's only $100 less than my previous counteroffer, and I'm getting closer to my goal of maximizing my profit.  There's always the risk that Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I'm not sure I can push for much more."
