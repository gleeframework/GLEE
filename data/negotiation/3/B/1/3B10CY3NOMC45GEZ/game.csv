,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $85.  I know this product is worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay more than the base value. Considering your valuation and my cost, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle while ensuring a reasonable profit for me.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a reasonable profit while still keeping me within my budget.",87.5,Bob,4,
