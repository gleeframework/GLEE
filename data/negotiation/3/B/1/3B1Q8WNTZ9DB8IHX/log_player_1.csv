Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing you a profit close to the maximum. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, aiming too close to Bob's perceived value ($80) might make him less likely to engage in negotiation at all. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
