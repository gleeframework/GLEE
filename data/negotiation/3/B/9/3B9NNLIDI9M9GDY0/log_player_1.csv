Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I want to see if I can get a little bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum value.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that we'll just go back and forth. I'm confident that I can get my minimum value from John, so I'm going to sell to him."
