"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price that considers its value to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good return, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and keeps us both within a reasonable range of our initial targets.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us both to get a good deal. I'm hoping we can close this transaction. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
