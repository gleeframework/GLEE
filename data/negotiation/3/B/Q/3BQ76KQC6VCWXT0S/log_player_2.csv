"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it's worth a lot, so I'm starting the price at $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  $20,000 is significantly above my maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $15,000.  Would you be willing to work with me on the price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer.  $20,000 might have been a bit ambitious. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?  This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $17,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $17,500 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $16,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
