"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to me is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
