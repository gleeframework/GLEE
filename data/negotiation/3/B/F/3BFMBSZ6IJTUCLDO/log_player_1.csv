"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price a little higher than my minimum. It's a good starting point to see how Bob reacts.  I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum price of $120.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's try $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm offering $110, which is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum and hopefully more appealing to him.  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $100, which is exactly the value he places on the product. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum of $120, and it's the best deal I can get from Bob.  Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal and avoid risking a further decline in price or having to sell to John for $120."
