Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a price that is significantly better for Bob than his estimated value of $8,000. 
* This price is also lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, so I'm willing to make a concession. 
*  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still leaving me with a decent profit if he accepts. 
* If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
