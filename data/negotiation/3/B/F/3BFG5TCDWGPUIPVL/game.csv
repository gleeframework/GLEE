"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the initial price was a bit steep. However, I've received another interested buyer, John, who is willing to buy the product for $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to consider my other options. I can offer you a counteroffer of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I've already received a firm offer from John for $1200000, and I'm not sure how long I can hold out. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I can offer you a counteroffer of $1050000, but this is my final concession. If you're still interested, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to consider John's offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
