"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product for me, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? That seems like a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.",11500.0,Bob,4,
