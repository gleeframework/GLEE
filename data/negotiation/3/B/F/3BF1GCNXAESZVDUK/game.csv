"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, but I'm still not convinced that $850000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $875000. This is as close as I can get to your target price without sacrificing my own profit margin.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, Alice, but I'm afraid I've gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from another seller.
