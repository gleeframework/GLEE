"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on it. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $11,500
* **Your Maximum:** $12,000
* **John's Offer:** $12,000

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, you know John will sell it to you for $12,000.  There's a chance you could get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer.  She might be willing to come down in price."
