"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $1050000.  This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let me know if that's something you're comfortable with.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1200000, which is $50000 less than my initial offer. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet in the middle at $1150000?  This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you still get a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1200000 for the product. Let's try $1180000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
