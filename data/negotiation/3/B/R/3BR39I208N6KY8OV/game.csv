"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, but $120 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $125, which is a fair compromise.  Let's seal the deal!",125.0,Alice,5,
