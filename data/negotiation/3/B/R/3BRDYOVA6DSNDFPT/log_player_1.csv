It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
