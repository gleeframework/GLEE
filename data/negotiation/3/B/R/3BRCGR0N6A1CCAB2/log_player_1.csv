Round 2
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'll try one more counteroffer."

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to sell to John for $1,000,000 than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
