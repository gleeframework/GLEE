"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price. You can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000, and you still have 9 rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you are serious about getting a lower price. It's a significant reduction from her initial offer, but still within the range of what you're willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still too high. You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and there's no reason to settle yet, especially with 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

This counteroffer increases your bid slightly from Round 2, showing Alice that you're willing to compromise. It also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're getting closer to a deal, but $1,125,000 is still a bit high. You have five rounds remaining to get closer to your desired price. Keep negotiating!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

You're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet halfway, but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You've shown Alice you're serious about getting a lower price, and you've already made a counteroffer in the previous round. It's time to see if Alice will come down further. You have three rounds left to close the deal, so you're not under immediate pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,120,000}
```

Since Alice is holding firm at $1,150,000, you're increasing your offer slightly to $1,120,000. You have two rounds left, and you're hoping this shows you're serious about getting a deal while still maintaining a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,145,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,145,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You only have one round left, and while you might be able to get a slightly lower price, it's risky to keep negotiating. $1,145,000 is a good price, and it's better than buying from John for $1,500,000. It's time to close the deal!"
