{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is above my maximum budget of $80.  It's in my best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 85. How about we meet in the middle at 100? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is better than her previous one, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $92.50? I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to 92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be 105. It's still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is still above my budget of $80.  While I could continue to negotiate,  it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  It's in my best interest to stop the negotiation and buy the product from John for $80."
