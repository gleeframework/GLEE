Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's worth considering.

```

Explanation:  Alice seems unlikely to budge much further.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of her holding firm and you having to accept a price close to $11,000.  Cutting your losses and buying from John for $15,000 is the safer choice."
