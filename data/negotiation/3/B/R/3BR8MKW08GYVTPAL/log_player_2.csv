"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. It's too high for my budget. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'll accept Alice's offer.  $110 is still a bit more than I wanted to pay, but it's a reasonable compromise and I'd rather not risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate."
