"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $9,500? I'm confident it's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves him $2,500 compared to buying from John."
