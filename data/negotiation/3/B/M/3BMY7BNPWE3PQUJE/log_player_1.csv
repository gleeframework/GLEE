Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know what you think, and we can go from there."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it might be worth more than Bob's initial assessment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage rather than walk away immediately.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while keeping the door open for a successful negotiation with Bob."
