"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  Let me know what you think, and we can go from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting price is far too high.  It's much higher than your maximum budget and what you know John will sell it for. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for negotiation or can confidently buy from John at a much lower price."
