"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  I know it's a valuable asset to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since both Alice and John are selling the product for the same price ($1,200,000), there is no financial benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Bob should reject Alice's offer and proceed to buy the product from John."
