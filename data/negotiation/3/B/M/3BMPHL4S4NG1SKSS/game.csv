"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional product. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. My starting price is $1500000.  Let's discuss further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $1200000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this unique product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1400000 is still a bit steep for me, but I'm getting closer. How about $1300000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to continue exploring a mutually beneficial agreement.  $1300000 is getting closer, but I still believe the product's value warrants a slightly higher price. I'm prepared to come down to $1350000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's unique qualities, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
