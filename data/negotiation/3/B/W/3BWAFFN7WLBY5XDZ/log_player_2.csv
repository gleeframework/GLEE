"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $135. It's worth a lot more than that to me, but I want to give you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer
