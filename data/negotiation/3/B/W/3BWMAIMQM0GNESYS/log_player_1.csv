Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's in excellent condition and a great deal for you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point, considering:

* **My minimum:** I want at least $150, so I can't go lower than that.
* **Bob's value:** He values the product at $120, so I need to be somewhere in between.
* **Negotiation:**  $135 allows for some negotiation space without immediately risking a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  Bob clearly wants the product and has demonstrated his willingness to negotiate. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit to $130. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $127 is the most I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $127 is just slightly below my minimum of $150. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  If I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, there's a good chance Bob will walk away. 
* **John's offer:** While John is willing to pay $150, it's not guaranteed he will still be interested if I keep rejecting Bob's offers.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer of $127 is the best option to secure a sale and avoid potentially losing both buyers."
