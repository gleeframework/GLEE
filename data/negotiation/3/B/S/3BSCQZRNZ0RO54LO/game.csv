"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for it, which is my maximum budget. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $8,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a price of $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to take a step back and think about it, and then I'll come back with a revised offer. Let me think for a moment...",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer. I'm still firm on $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to make a deal. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $8,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll come down to $9,500, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
