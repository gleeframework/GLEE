"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $14,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

We're still a good bit above John's offer, so it makes sense to try for a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $15,500?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 15500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $15,500 is a compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

While we could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $14,000 is a solid profit over John's $12,000 offer."
