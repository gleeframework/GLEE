Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob directly might be faster than waiting for John, justifying a potential premium. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you value a quick sale, you could adjust the price accordingly."
