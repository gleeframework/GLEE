Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This reflects the value I place on it and would allow for a fair profit margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
