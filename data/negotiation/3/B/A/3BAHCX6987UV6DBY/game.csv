"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This reflects the value I place on it and would allow for a fair profit margin for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your concerns about the price, but we're still confident that our product will bring significant value to your business. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price we're willing to consider, and we believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to invest in the product without overextending myself.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
