Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, my budget constraints still limit me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is moving closer to our desired price, there's room to negotiate further."
