"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is close to his maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to secure a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10,800. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll be happy with this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for improvement. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure an even better price. Since Bob has 10 rounds to make a deal and John is always available for $10,000, there's no immediate need to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,650.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,750. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,650, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. Let's try again! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close to Bob's target:**  $10,750 is only $750 more than Bob's desired $10,000.
* **There's a risk of going too low:**  If Bob continues to reject, Alice might become less willing to negotiate.
* **The opportunity cost of delaying:**  Bob could buy from John for $10,000, but with 5 rounds remaining, it's worth trying to secure a slightly better deal, even if it means spending a bit more.

**This strategy balances the desire for a lower price with the potential risks of over-negotiating and missing out on the opportunity to buy from Alice.**"
