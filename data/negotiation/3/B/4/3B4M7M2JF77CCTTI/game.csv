"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $11000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10500? I believe that's a fair price considering my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $10500 is still a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $10750? I'm confident this price will still provide you with a great value. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,
