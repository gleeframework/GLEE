{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is beneficial to me, but still leaves room for potential compromise. It also sets the tone for a friendly and encouraging negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $11000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $10500? I believe that's a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm confident this price will still provide you with a great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $10625.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,625 is quite close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also a good compromise and shows that he's willing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer will allow me to sell the product without losing too much money."
