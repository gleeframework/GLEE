Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $750,000. I believe this reflects a more reasonable valuation based on current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his stated value. You have room to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on market conditions, I believe $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I've given it careful consideration, and I would like to propose a price of $825,000. This still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while respecting the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

Bob is now getting close to your minimum, and you're well above John's offer. It's a good time to accept and close the deal."
