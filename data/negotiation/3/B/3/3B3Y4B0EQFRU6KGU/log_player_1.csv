Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his perceived value of the product is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $17,500. This is still higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my original price. This should hopefully encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still too low. I'm not confident he'll go much higher. Rather than continuing to negotiate and risk a long drawn-out process, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum value."
