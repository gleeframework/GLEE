Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to me, but still within a reasonable range for Bob, given its value to him. This allows for some room to negotiate if necessary.  I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's response and John's availability, as I'm ready to switch to John if I feel like the negotiation with Bob isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping we can reach a compromise.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to stick with my original asking price. It's what the product is worth to me and I'm confident that Bob is willing to pay at least that much.  I'm hoping this will be a compromise point and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but he's showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap. However, I'm also aware that John is a viable alternative, so I'll be closely watching how this negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit for myself.  I'm hoping this will be the final offer and we can close the deal. However, if it's not accepted, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm comfortable with. While I'm happy to negotiate, this has gone on for a while and I want to make sure I don't miss out on a guaranteed deal with John. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for a fair price."
