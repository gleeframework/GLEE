Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, the phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and the high price imply its worth. 
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Please let me know your decision soon"" adds a touch of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go, knowing you have John as a backup."
