Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired value."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,025,000 is getting closer, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a solution, but $1,025,000 is still below my minimum. I'm prepared to go to $1,035,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1035000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. 

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, it's becoming clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement that's beneficial to me. I've already made several concessions, and Bob isn't budging much.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that guaranteed sale."
