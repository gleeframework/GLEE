"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it holds. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable paying $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I'll gain from owning the product.",13500.0,Bob,4,
