Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Reasonable starting price:** $200 is a reasonable price that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:** This signals that you're willing to work with Bob, which can encourage him to make a counteroffer. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, which can help to build rapport.

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to analyze Bob's responses and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum value of $150. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $170?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 170}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Rejects Bob's offer politely:** It acknowledges his offer but clearly states it's not acceptable.
* **Offers a compromise:** $170 is closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Keeps the negotiation going:**  It invites Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is your minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures you get your minimum value without risking a further negotiation that might end in a lower offer or a sale to John for the same price."
