"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant drop from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a price you'd be happy with, given the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
