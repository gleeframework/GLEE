Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $600,000 is far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant drop from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a price you'd be happy with, given the product's value. What do you think?
