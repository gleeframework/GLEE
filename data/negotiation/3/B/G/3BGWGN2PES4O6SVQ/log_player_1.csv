Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  It also demonstrates that you're confident in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, there's still room to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150. Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows for continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer of $110, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for Bob to potentially come up a bit more if he really wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's still a significant improvement over selling to John. Accepting his offer ensures a decent profit and avoids further negotiation that could risk losing the deal altogether."
