Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) to see if I can get a good deal. I'm also leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price and matches what I could get from John. There's no reason to continue negotiating further. I'll accept his offer."
