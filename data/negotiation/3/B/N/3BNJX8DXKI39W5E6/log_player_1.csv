``` 

I'm offering the product at $10,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, but still a good profit for me.  I'm aiming for a quick sale, but I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $8,500 for the product. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $8,000, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but how about $9,500? It's still a good deal for you and leaves me some room to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested in working with that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand you're willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're open to this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, but I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a substantial loss.  I'll sell the product to John for $12,000, which is a much better deal for me."
