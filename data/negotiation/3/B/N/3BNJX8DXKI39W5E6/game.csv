"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $8,500 for the product. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $8,000, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but how about $9,500? It's still a good deal for you and leaves me some room to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested in working with that price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand you're willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8750.0,Bob,6,
