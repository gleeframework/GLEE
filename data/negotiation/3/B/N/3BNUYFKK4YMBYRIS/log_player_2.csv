"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the potential value I see in this product for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. You have no incentive to accept the offer since you can buy the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting, you leave open the possibility that Alice might lower her price to get a deal."
