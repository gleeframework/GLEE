Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and encouraging in my message to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can't pay more than $120 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing him by counter-offering.  Selling to John would be the same outcome, so accepting Bob's offer is the most efficient choice."
