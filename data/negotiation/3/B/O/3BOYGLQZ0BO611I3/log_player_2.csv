"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find extremely valuable. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, while John wants $1,200,000.
* **You can save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $100,000 compared to buying from John.

Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, it's still beneficial to accept a lower price and save money."
