I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping that this initial offer will be appealing enough to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $1,200,000. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the possibility of further negotiation with Bob.  It's also significantly higher than selling to John, and the risk of a longer negotiation with Bob isn't worth the potential gain."
