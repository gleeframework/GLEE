Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated the price down to $1,025,000, saving you $175,000 off Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Rounds:**  You have only three rounds left. Continuing to push might make Alice less willing to negotiate.
* **Alternative Cost:**  John's offer is $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you a considerable amount compared to buying from John. 

While you *might* be able to squeeze out a little more from Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential for minimal additional savings."
