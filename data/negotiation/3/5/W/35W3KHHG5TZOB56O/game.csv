"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.  I'm eager to acquire this product, but I need a price that makes sense for my business. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  This price reflects the value I believe you'll gain from this product.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,950,000 is still above what I can afford.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,375,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, allowing us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you think?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. While $1,375,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a significant gap from what I had in mind. Let's try $1,700,000. I believe this price point acknowledges the product's value while offering you a more accessible entry point.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
