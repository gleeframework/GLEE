Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to your company."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while allowing both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm not comfortable dropping below $925,000 at this point. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a beneficial outcome for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 925000}
