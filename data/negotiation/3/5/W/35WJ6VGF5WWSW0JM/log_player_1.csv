Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Potential for higher profit:** There's a chance Bob values the product even more than I do, and a higher starting price allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Confidence and value:** The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still make a profit by selling to John, but I might miss out on the opportunity to earn even more."
