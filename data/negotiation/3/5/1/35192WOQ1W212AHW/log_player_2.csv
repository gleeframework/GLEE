"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit,  let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer is now the same as John's. There's no point in negotiating further, as you'll get the same price from either seller."
