# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a great asset to your business. I'm starting at $1,450,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's talk!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $1,050,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,175,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000 as a final compromise. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let me know if you're able to meet me there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  At this point, accepting her ""final compromise"" offer doesn't save enough compared to John's price to be worth the risk of further negotiation."
