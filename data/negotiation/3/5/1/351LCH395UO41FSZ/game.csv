"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $1,050,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,175,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000 as a final compromise. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let me know if you're able to meet me there.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
