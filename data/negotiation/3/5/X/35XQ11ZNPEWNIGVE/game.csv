"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000,  which I believe is a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
