Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures I get more than my minimum desired price of $100. I'm confident in the value of the product and believe I can get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below what I know the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with an even lower price. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum, so I'm going to sell to John."
