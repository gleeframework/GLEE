"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This sets a strong initial bargaining position.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price.  Since I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, there's no reason to settle for less. This also shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum threshold, and it's more than I'm likely to get from John. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn."
