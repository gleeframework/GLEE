Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe its true value is significantly higher, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), she should aim higher than that with Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, Alice creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, Alice earns more than selling directly to John. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with the guaranteed sale."
