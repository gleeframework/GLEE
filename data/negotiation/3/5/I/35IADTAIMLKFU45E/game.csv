"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we aim for $1,200,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's aim for $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work for both of us, how about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal and make this happen!",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've considered your proposal carefully. While I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you be open to discussing $1,300,000 as a potential compromise?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
