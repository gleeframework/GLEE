I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $12,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'll be prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."

I'm reducing my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $12,000.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will get us closer to a deal."
