"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to you is estimated at $12,000. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $10,000.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet my asking price. However, I am unable to accept $9,000 for the product. I am willing to consider $9,500 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what he'd pay John ($12,000) and closer to his desired price range.  There's a chance Alice might come down further, but it's risky to continue negotiating. If Bob rejects this offer, he might end up paying more or even lose the opportunity to buy the product from Alice altogether."
