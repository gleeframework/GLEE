Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so $11,500 gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** This ensures you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you have some room to lower the price slightly to reach a mutually agreeable deal.

This approach balances your desire to maximize profit with the need to keep the negotiation open and avoid alienating Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing $1,200, which is a considerable amount. 

Rejecting the offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can propose a price closer to my desired value, potentially reaching a middle ground.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his initial offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary.

The possibility of selling to John for $12,000 is a strong motivator for continuing the negotiation. It gives me confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This would give you a great deal on a product you've shown interest in, and it's still a reasonable price for me. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I've reduced the price by $300, indicating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Maintaining a profit:** $11,200 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Framing it positively:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" and ""reasonable price"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting my counteroffer. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and not pushing Bob away entirely.  I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of the product and agree to a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than before, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a worse deal than I can get with John. 

Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is my desired outcome. It's a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer and losing a significant amount of money.  

Therefore, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed offer from John and move on."
