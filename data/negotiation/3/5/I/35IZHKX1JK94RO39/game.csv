"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,250. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,800. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,800 is cutting it a bit close for me.  Let's make this our final price: $13,000. This offer stands as a sign of good faith, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $12,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12900.0,Bob,6,
