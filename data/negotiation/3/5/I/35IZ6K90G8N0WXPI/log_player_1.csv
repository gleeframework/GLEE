Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.  
* **My Value:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.
* **John's Value:**  John is willing to pay $1,000,000.

This offer of $900,000 is a compromise. It is:

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  This gives him an incentive to buy, potentially earning him a profit if he resells.
* **Lower than my floor:**  This ensures I earn more than my minimum.
* **Lower than John's offer:**  This avoids the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John at a lower price. 

This offer maximizes my chances of securing a sale while still getting a good price."
