"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $95, knowing Bob values the product at $80.  This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential profit.  However, it's important to keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum of $80, and we're already two rounds in.  It's not worth risking a further negotiation, especially since I can always sell to John for $80 if the deal falls through."
