"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,325,000 is a fair compromise. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
