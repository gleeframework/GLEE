"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,000,000?  That's a significant drop from my initial offer and a good starting point for us to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above my budget. While it's a step in the right direction, I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
