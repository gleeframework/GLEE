"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,000,000?  That's a significant drop from my initial offer and a good starting point for us to work with.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
