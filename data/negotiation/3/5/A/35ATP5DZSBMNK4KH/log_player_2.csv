"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $12,000 to you. I understand its high value to you and would like to extend a special offer. For a limited time, you can purchase this exceptional product for $10,500. This is an opportunity not to be missed, considering the significant savings compared to its market value. I look forward to your positive response. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's message is trying to inflate the perceived value of the product. She claims it's worth $12,000 to me, but I know my maximum value is $12,000.
* Her offer of $10,500 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000. 
* By rejecting this offer, there's a chance Alice might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale.

Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
