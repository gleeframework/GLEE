"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for the minimum I need just yet. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I know the product is worth more to him.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a good profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise, knowing that he values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that we can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm now only $500 away from Bob's offer, and this is a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate.  With only 5 rounds left, I want to see if this small compromise is enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be realistic.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price,  $10,500 is a significant profit and ensures I don't lose out completely. It's a good compromise, and I'll accept Bob's offer."
