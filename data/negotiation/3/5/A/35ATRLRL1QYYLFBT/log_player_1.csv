Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I want to get as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Initial Offer:**  Offering $1,400,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm ready to walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Backup Plan:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows good faith and signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing it's a fair compromise. This helps Bob see the value in my offer.
* **No Big Loss:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000. This offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me a chance to secure a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. However, I am still unable to meet at $1,375,000. I would like to propose $1,360,000 as my final offer. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:** While Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is very close to my minimum, it's still below it.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a slightly better price, but it risks delaying the sale. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations.  

It's important to remember that while a slightly higher price from Bob is possible, the potential gain is small compared to the certainty and speed of selling to John."
