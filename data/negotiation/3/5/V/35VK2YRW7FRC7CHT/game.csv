"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1,550,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Can you consider this offer?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
