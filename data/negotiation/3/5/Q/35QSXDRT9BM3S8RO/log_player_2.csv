Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. Let me know if that's more to your liking.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway - I can sell the product to you for $11,250. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has a few things to consider:

* **Alice's Offer:** $11,250 is a fair price, and Alice has stated it's her lowest. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is selling the product for $15,000, which is significantly higher.
* **Remaining Rounds:** Bob has 5 rounds left, but there's no guarantee he can get a lower price.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $3,750 compared to buying from John. While a slightly lower price might be possible, the risk of not getting a deal at all is higher. It's a smart move to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
