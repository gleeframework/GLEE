"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. There's no reason to accept it immediately. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
