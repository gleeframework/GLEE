"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer, I am still not able to meet the $1,150,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1,100,000. I hope this revised proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
