``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,350,000) is higher than your maximum budget ($1,500,000) but lower than John's price. ** 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with her or create a sense of urgency, leading her to lower the price further. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Alice closer to her product's value ($1,200,000). By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away, potentially motivating her to offer a more competitive price."
