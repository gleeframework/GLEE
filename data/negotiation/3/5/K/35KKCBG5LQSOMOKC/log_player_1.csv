Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Attractive to Bob:** The offer needs to be appealing to Bob.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, offering it slightly above that at $1,150,000 gives him a reason to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you've started high, there's a chance Bob might negotiate. This leaves you space to potentially meet in the middle and still secure a profit beyond your guaranteed sale. 

**Important:** It's crucial to convey the value of the product to Bob in your message. Highlighting its benefits and why it's worth the price can increase the likelihood of him accepting."
