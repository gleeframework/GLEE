Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll see if I can negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $9,250 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my desired price with each round.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for $12,000.  I'll take the sure thing and move on."
