Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  It's not my absolute maximum, so if Bob counters, I can still potentially make a profit while leaving space for him to feel like he got a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or rejection. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counter with a lower price or to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** While $13,000 is less than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $15,000 and ensures a profit. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob might walk away completely, or that I might be forced to accept a lower price in later rounds. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and move on to other opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

Since I've accepted the offer, the transaction with Bob is complete."
