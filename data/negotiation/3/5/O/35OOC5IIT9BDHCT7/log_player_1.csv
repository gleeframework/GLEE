Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $135. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum but not overly aggressive. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $115 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm offering $125.  This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to his initial offer.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge further. I'm going to sell to John for $120. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's the best I can do at this point."
