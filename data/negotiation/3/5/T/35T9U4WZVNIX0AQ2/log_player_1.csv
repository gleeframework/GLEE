Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a valuable product for a price of $1,500,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:** The $1,500,000 offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium.  
* **Room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it leaves space for negotiation. You can always lower the price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

By starting high and being prepared to negotiate, you maximize your chances of securing the best possible price from Bob."
