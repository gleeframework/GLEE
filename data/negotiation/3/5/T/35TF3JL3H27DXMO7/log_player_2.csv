# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
