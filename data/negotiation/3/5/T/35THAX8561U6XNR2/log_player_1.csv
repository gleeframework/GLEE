Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. He gets it for $100,000 less than its worth to him, and you make $100,000 more than your guaranteed price from John.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly, making him less likely to dwell on the negotiation."
