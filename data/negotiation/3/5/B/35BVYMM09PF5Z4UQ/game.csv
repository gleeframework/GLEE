"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $850000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $920000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My new offer is $980000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above $980000. I'm willing to offer $920000 for the product, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",920000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $990000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in the product and meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to another buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price.",990000.0,Alice,9,
