"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recoup a bit more for my investment.  $950,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still offers you a substantial gain, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which allows you a good profit while staying within my budget.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
