Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with an offer higher than both my minimum price ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message includes a phrase about a ""limited time special price"" to create a sense of urgency and justify the high initial price.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. I'm prepared to:

* **Negotiate Down:** If Bob counters, I'll gradually lower the price, but never below my $100 minimum.
* **Walk Away:** If Bob's counteroffers remain too low or negotiations stall, I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I believe there's room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with an offer between $90 and $120, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle while still staying above my $100 threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've acknowledged Bob's counteroffer and proposed a price that's exactly halfway between his offer ($90) and my previous asking price ($120). This creates the perception of fairness.
* **Above Minimum:**  Importantly, this offer keeps me above my $100 minimum while still leaving some wiggle room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $95. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable profit without further risk or time spent in negotiation."
