"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,500. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering its value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $8,250 is the minimum I can do. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
