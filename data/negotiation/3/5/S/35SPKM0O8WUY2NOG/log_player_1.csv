Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Since the product is worth $15,000 to both me (Alice) and Bob, I'm offering the product at the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This ensures I get my minimum desired value while also maximizing the chance of Bob accepting the offer.  If Bob rejects, I can confidently move on to selling it to John for the same amount."
