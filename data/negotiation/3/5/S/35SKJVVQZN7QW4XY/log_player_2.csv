Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to reach a deal, $980000 falls short of what this product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll receive.  Let's find a way to make this work.
