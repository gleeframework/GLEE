{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  Based on its potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. This price reflects its inherent worth, but I'm open to reasonable discussion. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,150,000. This is a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Message:** I'm using positive language and highlighting the potential value of the product. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, making it clear that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Avoid immediate rejection:** Starting too high risks an immediate rejection, while starting too low might leave too much money on the table. 
* **Balance between profit and negotiation:** The starting price allows me to potentially secure a good price, while leaving room for negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Establish a framework:**  By emphasizing negotiation and mutual benefit, I'm setting the tone for a productive discussion rather than a simple ""take it or leave it"" scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, based on my budget constraints, I can only consider a price within the range of $950000 to $1000000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $980,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John is a safe option, rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to potentially increase my profit.
* **Leverage negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can demonstrate my commitment to achieving a more favorable price and encourage further negotiation. 
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I'm giving myself time to assess the situation and make a more informed decision."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to reach a deal, $980,000 falls short of what this product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll receive.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's constraints:** I address Bob's budget concerns, showing I understand his perspective.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's value and the potential for profit for Bob.
* **Significant concession:** The counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a substantial drop from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Fairness and compromise:** The message frames the counteroffer as a reasonable solution, suggesting that it's a fair balance between our interests.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive and encourages further discussion.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's price point, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to a fair price, but by reducing the price, I'm signaling that I'm also open to finding common ground. 
* **Setting the stage for agreement:** By making a reasonable concession, I'm increasing the chances of a successful negotiation and a mutually beneficial agreement."
