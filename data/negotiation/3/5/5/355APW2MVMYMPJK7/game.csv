"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'll make a new offer: I'll sell it to you for $102.50. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
