"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first. $130 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

``` 

Alice came down in price, and $120 is a reasonable deal. It's better to accept now than risk the negotiations stalling out and having to buy from John for $150."
