**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob can try to negotiate further to get closer to his target of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I appreciate your efforts to align our prices. In consideration of our previous discussions and your latest offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $850,000 for the product. This remains a strong value proposition given the product's capabilities and benefits. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's still at $850,000. Bob has already stated his willingness to pay $825,000, and it's unlikely she'll drop further.  It's now more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
