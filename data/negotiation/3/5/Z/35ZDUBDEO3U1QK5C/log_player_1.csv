Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for bargaining:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth before I might need to sell to John. 
* **Positive tone:** A friendly message increases the chances of Bob engaging in the negotiation and potentially agreeing to a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can still potentially get a better price from Bob.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer of $90 and my previous offer of $130. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a profitable price:**  $110 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation positive and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $95 is a more reasonable price for me. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The negotiation has gone back and forth, and I'm not confident that I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

I'm choosing to sell to John for a guaranteed $150 to avoid further negotiation and ensure a profitable outcome."
