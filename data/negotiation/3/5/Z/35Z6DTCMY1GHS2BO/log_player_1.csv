Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a sense that he can potentially get a better deal, motivating him to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** You still have room to negotiate downwards and maintain a profit.

This approach gives you a chance to see how motivated Bob is to buy the product and allows for a potentially mutually beneficial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $15,000, and even lower than your initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for you.

It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Even if you end up selling to John, the negotiation with Bob will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and reach a deal while still securing a profit.
* **Staying above your minimum:** $10,500 is still higher than your minimum acceptable value, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will receive by buying at this price, further encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a high chance that we won't be able to reach an agreement that's profitable for me.  

John is already offering my minimum acceptable value, so it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price."
