"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get a better deal with Alice or switch to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget. Since John is willing to sell the product for your target price of $1,000,000, it makes more sense to buy from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get the best possible deal."
