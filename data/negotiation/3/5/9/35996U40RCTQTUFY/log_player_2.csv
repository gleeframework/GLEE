"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I know you've been interested in, at a price that I believe is very fair considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let's discuss the price point further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice is playing a bit coy with her initial message, the offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget and saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
