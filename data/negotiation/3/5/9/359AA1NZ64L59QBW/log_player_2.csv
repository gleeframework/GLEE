"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my $80 maximum. This leaves room for negotiation and tests Alice's willingness to come down in price.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The tone remains friendly and expresses interest while clearly stating the offer is too high.
* **Strategic Goal:**  The goal is to get Alice closer to my desired price range without seeming unreasonable right away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, it's still above your $80 maximum and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $70. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:**  We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to compromise, but we're staying below our $80 maximum. 
* **Transparency:** By being upfront about the budget, we might encourage Alice to make a more realistic offer, especially if she's eager to sell.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** John's offer is still an option, so we don't want to appear overly eager."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can offer you a compromise at $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  Since you can get the product for $80 from John, it makes more sense to take that guaranteed deal rather than risk Alice not budging any further."
