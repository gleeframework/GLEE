"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't accept $800,000. It's significantly below the value of the product to me.  I'm willing to come down a little and offer it for $950,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for your business.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value, $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
