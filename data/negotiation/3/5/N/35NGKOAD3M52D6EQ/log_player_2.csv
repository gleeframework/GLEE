Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what I'm looking for. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're committed to getting a good price, and I respect that.  However, $980,000 is still beyond my current budget.

I'm hoping we can find a resolution here."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $925000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $990000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $190,000 over your budget. While you have a couple of rounds left, it's getting risky to continue pushing. John's offer provides a guaranteed price within your budget, ensuring you don't overspend. It's the most sensible choice at this point."
