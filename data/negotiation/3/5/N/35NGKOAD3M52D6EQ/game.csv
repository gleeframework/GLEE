"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1100000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900000. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer and a fair price given my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what I'm looking for. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're committed to getting a good price, and I respect that.  However, $980000 is still beyond my current budget. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering a final price of $925000. This is a significant step closer to your offer and a fair price given my budget. I'm hoping we can find a resolution here.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $925000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $990000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.
