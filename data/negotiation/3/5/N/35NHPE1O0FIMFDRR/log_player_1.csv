"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum desired value of $1,200,000. This gives Bob a strong incentive to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** It's crucial to have room to negotiate. By starting at $1,100,000, I can potentially lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us. This helps build a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is too far below my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would give you a great deal, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that $1,000,000 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's value to him. 
* **Maintaining my minimum:** By sticking to $1,000,000, I ensure I don't go below my minimum acceptable price."
