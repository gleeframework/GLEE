"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the value I believe the product holds. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $800000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
