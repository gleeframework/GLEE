Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $108? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium over John's offer, and we are getting close to his maximum price. Accepting $108 secures a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
