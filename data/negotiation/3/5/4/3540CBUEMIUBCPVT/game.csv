"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price closer to my valuation. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $750,000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart. I understand you have a budget, and I want to make this work. How about we meet at $850,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
