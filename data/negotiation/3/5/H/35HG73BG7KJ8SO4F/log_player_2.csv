"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth $120 to you. We're currently looking to sell it for $110. Would you be interested in making this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, as it's still above Alice's minimum value of $100 but significantly lower than her initial offer. It shows that you're serious about buying the product but also trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product for $107. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107 is within my budget and a good compromise considering my initial counteroffer of $105.  Accepting this offer saves me $3 compared to buying from John and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
