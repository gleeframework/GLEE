"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,250. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
