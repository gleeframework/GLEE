"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering it's worth the same to you. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer or buying from John would result in the same cost.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and keep his options open for potentially finding a better deal elsewhere."
