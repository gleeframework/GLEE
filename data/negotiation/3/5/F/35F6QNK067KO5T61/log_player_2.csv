Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can work out a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is enticing, the product's value is significantly higher for someone who can leverage it fully like you can. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to pay as little as possible.  While $1,050,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price.  There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still feeling a bit high at $1,050,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  That seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
