Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to capture any of that surplus.

**Strategy**

You want to find a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases the likelihood of acceptance.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find this offer more than fair.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1180000}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  The message is friendly, emphasizes value to Bob, and hints at a good deal without explicitly saying so. 
* **The Price:** $1,180,000 gives Bob a $20,000 discount on his valuation, making it highly likely he'll accept. This nets you an $180,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat rational. If you have reason to believe he's a tough negotiator, you might lower the price slightly to increase your chances.
* **Information Asymmetry:** This scenario assumes Bob doesn't know your guaranteed offer from John. If he knew, your bargaining power would decrease.
