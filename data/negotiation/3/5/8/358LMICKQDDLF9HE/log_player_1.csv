Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John's guaranteed price.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but be realistic. You want to maximize your profit without pushing Bob away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're not starting with a lowball offer, demonstrating the product's value.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number. Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""return on investment"" subtly appeals to Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room:**  While close to Bob's maximum, the $100,000 gap allows for some negotiation if he counters.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style (e.g., if he's highly price-sensitive), you might adjust your offer slightly."
