# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to John's price."
