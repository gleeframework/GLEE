"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking to spend no more than $150. While Alice's offer of $125 is better than John's $150, Bob can still save $25 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
