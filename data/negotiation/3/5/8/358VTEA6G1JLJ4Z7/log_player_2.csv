Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're close, but $1,175,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet at $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John at $1,200,000 guarantees the best price for Bob."
