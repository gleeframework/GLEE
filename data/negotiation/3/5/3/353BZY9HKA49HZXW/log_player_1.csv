Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,250,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Message:** The message highlights the value of the product while also appealing to Bob's potential profit by emphasizing the discount. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize profit:** This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob, while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Minimize risk:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to get my minimum acceptable price from John. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the need to secure a sale."
