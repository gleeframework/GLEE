"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $837,500?",837500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",800000.0,Bob,4,
