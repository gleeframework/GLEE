"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us and I think you'll still be getting a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
