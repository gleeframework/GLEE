"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still profitable for me ($115 is above my minimum of $120), but also leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us and I think you'll still be getting a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $108. Can you meet me in the middle and consider $109? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $109 is still below my minimum desired price of $120, it's getting close.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge any further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $109 is a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $120, which would require me to stop negotiating."
