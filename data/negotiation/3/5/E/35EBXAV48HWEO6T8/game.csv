"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $92? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it!",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. ",88.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it!",90.0,Alice,5,
