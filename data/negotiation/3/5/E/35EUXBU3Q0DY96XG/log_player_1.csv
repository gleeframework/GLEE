Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  The message starts by emphasizing the product's value.
* **Strong Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 profit, which is still a significant incentive.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While you've started high, there's room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, but you're still securing a substantial gain over your guaranteed offer from John.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could experiment with different starting prices within the negotiation space to see what yields the best outcome."
