(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($1,200,000).**
* **Buying from Alice saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.** 

Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer is the most logical choice in this scenario.  You save money and avoid the risk of Alice changing her mind or the product becoming unavailable."
