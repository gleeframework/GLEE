While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my personal value of $120. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my value for the product. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $120.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is close to Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate while keeping the price closer to my target."
