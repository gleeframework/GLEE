Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $17,000, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either:

* **Accept a counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is close to my desired price or if I feel pressured by the time constraint, I might accept.
* **Make a counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **Sell to John:**  If negotiations with Bob stall or I feel like I'm not getting a good enough price, I'll sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $14,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates that he is genuinely interested in the product, which opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Potential for better price:** I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'll try to find a compromise that is still fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I'm happy to accept $15,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. This shows that I am willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, emphasizing that I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Firm but Fair:** The counteroffer is still above my minimum value of $15,000 but is also within a range that Bob might be willing to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept Bob's counteroffer:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I will sell the product to him for $15,500.
* **Make another counteroffer:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will consider making a final counteroffer, possibly closer to his offer. However, if his offer is still too low, I will likely proceed to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go $15,250. It's a fair price, and it's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time constraint:**  It's unclear how much time I have left in the negotiation process.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could try to get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck with selling to John for $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $15,250.  This secures a price that is only slightly below my minimum, and I can move on to other opportunities."
