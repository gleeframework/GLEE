"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. Considering your offer of $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd like to counteroffer at $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need you to meet me halfway at $10,750. Do we have a deal?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750, but I need to make a small adjustment to ensure I'm not losing too much on the deal. I'd like to counteroffer at $10,700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally meet in the middle.",10700.0,Alice,7,
