"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $11,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a significant discount. Offering $9,500 is a substantial step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This counteroffer positions Bob as a serious buyer while indicating he's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value of this product and believe $10,500 is a fair price. It reflects the true worth of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and $10,500 is still higher than his ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get closer to his target price of $9,500. There's still room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet. How about $10,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a smaller counteroffer, showing that he's willing to meet Alice halfway.  He's moved closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating his seriousness about buying the product. This counteroffer is a calculated risk - if Alice rejects it, he may have to consider buying from John."
