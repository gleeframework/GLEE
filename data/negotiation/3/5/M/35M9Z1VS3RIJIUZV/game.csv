"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you, and I'm thinking of starting at $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value it brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $980,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While I see the value, $980,000 is still a bit above my limit.  Would you consider $930,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",930000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $930,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
