"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150 from John, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer opens the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. That's still a great price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. It's still a better price than John's offer, so there's no need to switch sellers just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $130 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $125. Let's split the difference and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
