"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  If you decline, I'll be forced to explore other options.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I still think $900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and pay $812,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",812500.0,Bob,6,
