"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, you can reject her offer.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  You can then buy the product from John for the same price,  giving you the option to potentially negotiate with Alice later if she decides to lower her price."
