"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $16,000? This reflects the product's worth while still giving you a fair deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
