It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:** $915,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Both you and Alice have presented final offers. It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better deal.
* **Time Constraint:** You're running out of rounds, and there's a risk Alice could walk away in the last round, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
