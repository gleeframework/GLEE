"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget, but $10,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we settle on $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession to get this deal done.",10800.0,Bob,4,
