"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point represents a more reasonable compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $1,000,000?  That feels like a fair offer to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
