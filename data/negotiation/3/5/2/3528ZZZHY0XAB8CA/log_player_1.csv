Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, I believe $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value you've stated and my own research, I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
