"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, I believe $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value you've stated and my own research, I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for a figure closer to my initial proposal. Would you consider $1,050,000? This acknowledges the value you see while recognizing the true worth of this unique product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1,000,000? This reflects a fair compromise for both of us. I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
