"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations if you'd like to discuss further.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to go to $15,500, which would allow both of us to come to a good agreement.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,500. However, I'm not quite ready to give up on the extra $500 just yet. How about we meet at $16,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
