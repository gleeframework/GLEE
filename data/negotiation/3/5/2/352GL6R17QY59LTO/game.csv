"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 still isn't quite working for me.  I'm very motivated to sell this product, and I think it's a great fit for you. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I wouldn't want to miss out on the opportunity to work with you.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,750 again, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you think about it?",8750.0,Bob,6,
