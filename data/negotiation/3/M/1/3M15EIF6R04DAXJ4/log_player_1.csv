"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a large portion of the value Bob sees in the product.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a significant profit. This shows flexibility while maintaining a strong position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the best option. I'll counteroffer again, but with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to show further flexibility and willingness to compromise.  At this point, I'm getting closer to the $900,000 price point Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's in between our last offers, hoping to reach a compromise.  It's also still significantly above my minimum, so I'm still in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation, as Bob's offer is just above my minimum.  However, I have already been negotiating for a while, and with only two rounds left, there's a high risk of Bob rejecting any further counteroffers. Selling to John would result in a lower profit than I can get with Bob. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
