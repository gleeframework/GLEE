"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost to you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is still significantly below the value I'm seeking.  However, I'm willing to compromise further.  I'll accept $875000 for the product. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price point. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
