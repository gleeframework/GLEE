"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob might reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards, but I want to see how high he's willing to go first."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $500,000 is too low. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap."
