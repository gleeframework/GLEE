"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fantastic deal, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is close to your maximum but not ideal.** You're willing to pay $12,000, and she's asking for $11,500. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have a backup plan.** John offers the product for $12,000. This means you won't be left without the product if you reject Alice's offer. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to:

* **Negotiate a better price with Alice.** She might be willing to lower her price to make the sale. 
* **Force her to reveal her lowest price.** Even if she doesn't budge much, you'll have a clearer picture of how low she's willing to go."
