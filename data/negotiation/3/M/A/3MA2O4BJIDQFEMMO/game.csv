"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. While I think the product is valuable, $950,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This reflects the value to me and also leaves some room for you to make a profit. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",875000.0,Bob,4,
