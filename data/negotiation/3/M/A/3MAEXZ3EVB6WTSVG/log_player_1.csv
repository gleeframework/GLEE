"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit greater than my minimum threshold.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is below my minimum threshold, and I'm still confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This shows flexibility while still remaining within my acceptable profit margin.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not comfortable accepting that price. I believe we can reach a better agreement, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer to $105.  I'm getting closer to Bob's price point, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. This offer represents a significant compromise, and I hope it encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations aren't moving forward quickly.  I'm not comfortable accepting Bob's offer of $90.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120.  At least this way I can guarantee a profit and move on to other opportunities."
