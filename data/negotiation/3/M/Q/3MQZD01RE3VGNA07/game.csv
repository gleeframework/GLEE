"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you and I'm willing to come down from my minimum price.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This allows you a significant profit margin while giving me a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $925,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which leaves some room for profit on both sides.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see you're coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $885,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to close this deal.",885000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $895,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's only slightly below my minimum.  Let's finalize this deal.",895000.0,Alice,7,
