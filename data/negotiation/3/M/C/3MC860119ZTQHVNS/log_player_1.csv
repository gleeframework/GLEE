Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm confident I can sell it to John for $100 if Bob isn't interested, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but $90 is below my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's fair for me. $105 is a good middle ground, and I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept it, as it's a better deal than selling to John for $100."
