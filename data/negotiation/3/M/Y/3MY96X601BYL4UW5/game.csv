"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $9,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I can offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",8100.0,Alice,5,
