"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
