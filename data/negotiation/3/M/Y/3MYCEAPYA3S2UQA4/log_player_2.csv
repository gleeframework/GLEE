"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is still too high. You can likely get a better price with further negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is a compromise between our two numbers. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation. You're determined to get a better price, so rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer seems like the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,000,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I like your persistence, and I appreciate the suggestion to split the difference. However, I was thinking that since you're already getting a great deal at $1000000, I could offer you an even sweeter deal. How about we meet at $1020000? This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to my minimum price than $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you're still aiming to get a better deal. You have several rounds left, so it's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to go up to $980,000.  I'm confident that this price is fair, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. How about we meet at $990000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've managed to negotiate a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to your desired price.  While a bit more negotiation might get you a few thousand dollars lower, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting her offer at $990,000 is a good compromise and a solid deal."
