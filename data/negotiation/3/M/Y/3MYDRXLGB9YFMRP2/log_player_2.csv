You're still within the range you're willing to pay, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While you could continue negotiating, Alice is clearly firm on her price, and it's only $2 more than your last counteroffer. It's not worth risking the deal and potentially having to pay John $150."
