Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value exceeds Bob's perceived $8,000, encouraging him to reconsider.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""public listing"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting at $12,000, the message keeps the tone conversational (""What do you think?""), inviting Bob to counter-offer and begin a dialogue.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but carries a slight risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright.  
*  It's essential to gauge Bob's personality and negotiation style. If you sense he's very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective."
