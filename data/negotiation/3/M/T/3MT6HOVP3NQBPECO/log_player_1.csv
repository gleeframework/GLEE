"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly and positive message sets a good tone for the negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to see it as a worthwhile investment.

This offer aims to initiate the negotiation and see if Bob is willing to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While Bob is interested, he's clearly trying to get a very low price. I can likely secure a better deal with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $10,000, which is my minimum target.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open and showing Bob that I'm not willing to settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000.
* **Reiterating value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see the $9,000 price as fair.
* **Focusing on a win-win:**  I emphasize that this price allows for a good outcome for both of us.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $8,200. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $8,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  While Bob has shown a slight willingness to increase his offer, we are still quite far apart. 
* **Selling to John is a strong option:**  I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and selling to John for $10,000 is a very attractive alternative.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my stance and keeping the option of selling to John open. There's still time to try and reach a better agreement with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly below my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $8,750.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm making a more significant compromise by lowering my price to $8,750, which is closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I explicitly mention that this is a significant compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a fair offer.
* **Closing the deal:** I use language like ""closing the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer is a significant concession, aiming to bridge the gap and potentially secure a deal before reaching the halfway point of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $8,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. 
* **John's offer is attractive:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a very secure option, and the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are diminishing.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the option of selling to John open. However, I will also need to consider the value of continuing to negotiate with Bob in the remaining rounds.  I may need to make a larger concession to secure a deal with Bob, but only if it makes sense financially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go down to $8,600, but this is my final offer.  Consider the value you'll get from the product and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while now.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This emphasizes that I'm not willing to lower my price further.
* **Appeal to value and time:** I remind Bob of the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.
* **Confidence in the deal:**  I express confidence that this is a good deal for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'm not happy with this price, it's approaching my lower limit. I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of the product and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while now, and will accept this offer. If he rejects, I will likely move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $8,400. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is too low:** $8,400 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's not clear if Bob is willing to budge further.
* **Limited time:** We only have two rounds left, and the likelihood of reaching a significantly better price with Bob is slim.
* **Secure option:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed profit and ensures I meet my minimum target.

While I'd prefer to negotiate a better deal with Bob, the potential gains are too small compared to the risk of ending up with a price significantly below my minimum. Selling to John provides a certain and more financially advantageous outcome."
