Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than your minimum.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** A $1.4 million price ensures a substantial profit for you.
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves $100,000 for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1 million provides a safety net. If Bob becomes too difficult, you can always sell to John."
