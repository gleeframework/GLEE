# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You'd pay $1,300,000 from Alice versus $1,500,000 from John. 
* **You save money by accepting Alice's offer.** Even though you have a higher budget, it's always better to get a lower price."
