"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make me a deal for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price point of $120. You can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
