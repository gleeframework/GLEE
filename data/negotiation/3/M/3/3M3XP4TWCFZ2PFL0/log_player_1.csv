Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000, which reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 (your minimum acceptable price), you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value Justification:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects this offer, you can always come down in price, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
