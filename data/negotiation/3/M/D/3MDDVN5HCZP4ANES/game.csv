"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a good deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. $125 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $117?",117.0,Bob,4,
