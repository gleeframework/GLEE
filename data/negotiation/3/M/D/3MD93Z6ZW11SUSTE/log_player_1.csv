Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While it's tempting to take the $750,000, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $800,000 with some negotiation. I have several rounds to go, and John is a reliable backup option."
