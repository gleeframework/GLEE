"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still a significant markup.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm offering $100, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Within my budget:**  $100 is still within my price range of $150.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a higher price, but it gives us a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $130 is still more than I want to pay. 
* **We're getting closer.**  Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **I'll counteroffer again.** By rejecting this offer, I can continue to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to middle ground:** I'm increasing my offer to $110, showing flexibility and demonstrating that I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Still within my budget:**  $110 is still comfortably within my price range of $150.
* **Pressure on Alice:** This offer puts pressure on Alice to accept or counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her previous offer, $135 is still more than I'm willing to pay. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 5 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate further.
* **Counteroffer is key:** I'll make another counteroffer to try and get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm increasing my offer to $120, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $110 and Alice's offer of $135. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Getting closer to the goal:**  $120 is still within my budget and gets me closer to the price range I'm aiming for.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  This offer puts further pressure on Alice to accept or come down with a counteroffer closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  $140 is only $10 less than what John is selling it for, and I'm running out of time.
* **Negotiation is failing.** Alice seems unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not confident I can get her down to my desired price in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is critical:**  I only have 3 rounds left, and I don't want to risk being stuck with a high price or running out of time entirely. 

Therefore, it's more efficient and safer to buy from John at this point."
