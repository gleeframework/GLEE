,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still offer you significant value, and it's a price I believe we can both be happy with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's split the difference - how about $1,000,000? This would still offer you significant value, and it's a price I'm confident we can both be happy with.  It's a win-win situation.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $987,500?  That's only a small difference from your offer, and it would make this a truly mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",987500.0,Alice,7,
