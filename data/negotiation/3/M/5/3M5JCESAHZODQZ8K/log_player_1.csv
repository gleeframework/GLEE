"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a high offer that's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while maximizing my potential earnings.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, aiming to establish a sense of shared understanding.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording leaves the door open for counteroffers, suggesting a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is too low:**  While it's better than John's offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum target of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still offer you significant value, and it's a price I believe we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum target and John's offer. 
* **Show Flexibility:** My message demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the value Bob will still gain at this price.
* **Closing the Gap:** By offering $1,050,000, I'm closing the gap between our offers, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum target, it's still not enough. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still pursuing a price closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's split the difference - how about $1,000,000? This would still offer you significant value, and it's a price I'm confident we can both be happy with.  It's a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and meet halfway. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the significant value he'll get at this price.
* **Win-Win Framing:** I frame the offer as a win-win situation to encourage acceptance.
* **Closing the Deal:** This counteroffer is a significant step closer to my minimum target, and I believe it's a price that Bob will be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum Target:** While $975,000 is very close to my minimum target of $800,000, I believe I can still get a slightly better price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm only $25,000 away from my target.  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still pursuing a price closer to my goal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $987,500?  That's only a small difference from your offer, and it would make this a truly mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 987500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's only $12,500 more than Bob's offer, demonstrating a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price would make the deal beneficial for both of us.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer is only $12,500 away from my minimum target, so I'm very close to a deal.

I believe that this final counteroffer will push Bob towards accepting, as he's now just a small amount away from his desired price, while I'm very close to my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $987,500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my minimum target of $800,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, the risk of losing a deal altogether is high.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If I reject this offer, I risk ending up with John's offer of $800,000. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a sale that's significantly better than my alternative.  It's a strategic decision to minimize risk and maximize my potential earnings at this point."
