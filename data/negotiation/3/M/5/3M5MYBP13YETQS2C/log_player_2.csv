# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. Bob can reject this offer and try to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,120,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While Bob might prefer a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy at a higher price from John is too great. Accepting this offer is the most financially prudent choice for Bob."
