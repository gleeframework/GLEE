"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and ensures I get a strong return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves you a substantial profit, and it allows us to both walk away happy. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
