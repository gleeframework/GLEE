Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
