"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and ensures I get a strong return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can do better. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and Alice's offer leaves a significant gap for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This still gives you a good profit, and it's a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves you a substantial profit, and it allows us to both walk away happy. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price for you. You're still getting the product for significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's likely that you can continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price, but the risk is that Alice might reject your counteroffers, and you could end up paying more by going to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without any further risk."
