"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's the best I can do.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $107.50 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $112.50 as a final compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $112.50, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $109, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",109.0,Bob,6,
