"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $20000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $20000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to pay $15000, which is my absolute limit.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,
