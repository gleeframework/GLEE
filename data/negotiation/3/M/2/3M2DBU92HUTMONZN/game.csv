"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference - how about $127.50?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $130. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's a great compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",132.5,Alice,5,
