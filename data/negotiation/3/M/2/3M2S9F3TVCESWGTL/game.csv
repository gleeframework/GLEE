"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,700,000. This is a compromise that I'm confident you'll find reasonable.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the potential for us to close this deal quickly.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
