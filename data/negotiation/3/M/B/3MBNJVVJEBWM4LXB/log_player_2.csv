Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our previous conversations, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that takes into account your budget constraints, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is very unlikely to go below $850,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation and risking a higher final price."
