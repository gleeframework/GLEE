"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
