"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his perspective, $950,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. This price is still beneficial to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

While $975,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can secure a better deal if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
