Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the product's value to make Bob more receptive.
* **Open Ended:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going.

This approach balances maximizing my potential profit with keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $120 is Bob's perceived value, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I can likely secure a higher price through further negotiation. 
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $150 from John, so I can afford to be firm with Bob.

I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I think it's fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm remaining friendly and open to reaching an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit while still keeping the negotiation open."
