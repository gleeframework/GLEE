"Bob, I understand your position, but $1450000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1525000. This still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",1525000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1525000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1487500?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",1487500.0,Bob,4,
