"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $14,500? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While $14,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $15,500.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a little outside my comfort zone. How about we split the difference at $15,250?  This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",15250.0,Bob,4,
