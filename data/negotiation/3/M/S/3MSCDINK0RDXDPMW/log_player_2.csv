 ""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $110 to be happy. Can we discuss that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $110.  You've established a firm ceiling and she's met you halfway between your last two offers. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to buy from John for $150."
