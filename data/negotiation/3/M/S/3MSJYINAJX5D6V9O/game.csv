"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price for a product with such potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, but my goal is to be fair and $975,000 is still too low. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a good deal.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,012,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1012500.0,Bob,6,
