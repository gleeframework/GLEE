"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your budget, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
