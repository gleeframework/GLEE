"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident will be a great asset for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the true value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your max price:** $15,000
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

You can get the product for $1,000 less from John, even though he's your fallback option. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer to save that money."
