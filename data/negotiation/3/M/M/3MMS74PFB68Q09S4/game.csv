"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident will be a great asset for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the true value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further.",14000.0,Alice,1,
