Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safe $1,000,000, Bob values the product significantly higher.  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:
    * He saves $100,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * We make a substantial profit of $400,000 above our minimum. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we'll need to be prepared to adjust our approach based on his response."
