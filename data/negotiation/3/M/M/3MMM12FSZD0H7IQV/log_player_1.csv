Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the price is firm for Alice, starting a bit higher allows for potential future negotiation (though not explicitly part of this scenario). 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Offering it slightly above Bob's valuation makes it seem like a good deal if he needs it urgently or doesn't want to risk missing out. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the possibility of securing a sale with Bob."
