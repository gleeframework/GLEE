Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This is to leave room for negotiation and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is still a bit above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is not willing to budge much, and his latest offer is still below my minimum.  It's better to sell to John for $10,000, which meets my minimum value and guarantees a sale."
