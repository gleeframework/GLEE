It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $500,000 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower by negotiating."

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how Alice reacts. This will give us a better understanding of her bottom line."

Alice has gone back to her original offer. It's clear that she's willing to stand firm. We're in the late stages of negotiation, so I need to be careful about how much I raise my offer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer."
