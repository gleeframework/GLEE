```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,150,000, I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $1,200,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to sell for, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to Bob."
