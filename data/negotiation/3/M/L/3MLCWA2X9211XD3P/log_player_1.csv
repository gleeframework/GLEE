Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but significantly less than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I profit.
* **Strategic advantage:** This leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer. If his counteroffer is close to my offer, I'm in a good position to negotiate. 
* **John as backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage during negotiations with Bob. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can easily walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $12,500 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining profit:**  The price is still above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Setting the stage for a potential deal:**  This counteroffer positions me for a successful negotiation, giving Bob a realistic target price while still allowing me to make a profit."
