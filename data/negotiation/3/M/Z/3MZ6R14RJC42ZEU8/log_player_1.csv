Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I want to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  Offering $120 gives Bob a clear starting point to counter without immediately reaching my minimum. 

I'm confident that Bob will likely make a counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate further to find a price that works for both of us.  However, I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum of $80.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to get closer to my target price. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if he's truly serious about the product and if he's willing to go higher.

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects again, I may have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to go a little lower to $100, but I really need to get at least that much for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not giving away too much. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Encouraging a deal:** I'm asking for his opinion to keep the conversation going and potentially lead to a quick agreement. 

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway at $100. If not, I'll need to consider my options more carefully."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Little room for further negotiation:**  While I could try to squeeze out another few dollars, it's likely Bob won't budge much further, and I risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer, and I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go higher. 

Considering the potential of losing the deal, I think it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
