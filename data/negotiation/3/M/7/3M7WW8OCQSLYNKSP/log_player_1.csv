"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. While his offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and aim for a better price.  I'm not willing to go as low as John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I can offer $1,425,000, and that's my best offer. It's a fair deal for a product of this value."",
""product_price"": 1425000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm applying pressure by stating this is my best offer while still leaving some slight room for negotiation.  The offer is a significant jump from his last, signaling it's time for him to be more serious if he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your best offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still significantly under my minimum acceptable price. While I risk him walking away, I'm willing to push him a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal. I haven't reached the point where accepting John's offer is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand the value of this product.  $1,375,000 is my absolute final offer. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere for something this valuable."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm reiterating that this is my final offer to signal I'm not budging much further. I'm also highlighting the product's value to incentivize him to accept. This offer is still above my fallback option of selling to John, but the gap is narrowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced I'm getting the best deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,375,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer $1,337,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still negotiating, but his offer is getting dangerously close to my fallback of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer of $1,337,500 secures me a profit above my minimum, even if it's less than I'd hoped for at the start.  Pushing further risks him walking away entirely, leaving me to accept John's offer."
