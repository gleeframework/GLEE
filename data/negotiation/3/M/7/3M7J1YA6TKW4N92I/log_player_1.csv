"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the product's value and potential for Bob.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm giving Bob the opportunity to counter without immediately making him feel like he's being pushed too hard. 
* **Keeping the option to sell to John:** I'm not completely tied to Bob and still have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested in the product, and I still have 8 rounds to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $8,500? That's still a fair price for this amazing product, and I think it's within your budget.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** $8,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a profitable price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm still framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, making him feel valued and motivated to reach an agreement.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm still open to further negotiation in the upcoming rounds. 
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** I'm not completely tied to Bob and still have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, I'm still a bit away from that price point. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  We've narrowed the gap, and I still have 6 rounds to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this amazing product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to Bob's offer:** $7,500 is closer to Bob's offer of $7,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintain a positive and persuasive tone:**  I'm still highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Still above minimum price:**  $7,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so it's a good compromise.
* **Focus on finality:** I'm emphasizing the idea of ""making this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary, but I'm optimistic that we can reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $7,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still too low for me to accept at this stage.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** We've narrowed the gap significantly, and I still have 4 rounds to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to potentially get a better price. 
* **There's room for compromise:** I'm confident that with further negotiation, we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. Let's make this happen.  I'm willing to go down to $7,400. That's a good price for you and it gets me closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  $7,400 is a small compromise from my previous offer, showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Focus on Closing:** I'm using phrases like ""Let's make this happen"" to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Above Minimum:** $7,400 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so it's a good compromise. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm making a more significant concession to increase the likelihood of a deal.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I can still sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations fall through."
