"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $8,500? That's still a fair price for this amazing product, and I think it's within your budget.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this amazing product.  Let's make this deal happen!",7500.0,Alice,5,
