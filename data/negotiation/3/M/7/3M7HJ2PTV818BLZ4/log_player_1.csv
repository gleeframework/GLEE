Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,750,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,750,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the process.  
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price and pique his interest.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob, avoiding the need to sell to John at the lower price."
