"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Since Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, it makes sense to buy from John. There's no reason to engage in a negotiation with Alice when he can get the product at his price limit immediately from John."
