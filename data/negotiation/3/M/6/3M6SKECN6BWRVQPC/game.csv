"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. To start a productive negotiation, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while providing a reasonable starting point for discussion.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. It offers unique capabilities and advantages that justify a higher price. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price.  However, $1,750,000 is still beyond my comfortable range.  To keep negotiations moving, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're both trying to find a price that works. To be transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000. It represents a significant compromise on my end, considering its true value. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement, but I'm also prepared to explore other options if we can't bridge the gap.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
