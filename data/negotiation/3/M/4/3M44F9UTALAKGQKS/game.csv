"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to me is still higher than that, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $9,500.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
