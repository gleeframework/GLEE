"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is attractive, it's still above your ideal price point. You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John at $12,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value I've placed on the product. I believe it's still a great deal for you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,500, which is within your budget and closer to your counteroffer of $9,000. It's a good deal considering you have the option to buy from John for $12,000. Accepting the offer saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John."
