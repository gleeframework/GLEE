{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and leaves room for negotiation. It's also below the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), making it potentially appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and closer to my target price.  I'm going to accept his offer."
