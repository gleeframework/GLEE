{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for finding a mutually agreeable price. This approach aims to maximize your potential earnings while leaving room for Bob to counter if he finds the price too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation and am interested, but I can only pay up to $150 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Since Bob's offer is the minimum price you're willing to sell for, it makes sense to sell to John immediately.  This avoids further negotiation and ensures you get your minimum desired price."
