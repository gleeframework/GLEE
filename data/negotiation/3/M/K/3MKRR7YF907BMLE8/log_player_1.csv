Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $125 is more than your minimum price of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation and potential for both of you to get a good deal.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** The message communicates that you're willing to negotiate but also have a specific price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $125 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than selling to John for $100, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a little to $115.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
