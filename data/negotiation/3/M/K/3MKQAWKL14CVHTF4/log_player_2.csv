"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this amazing product for $95. It's a steal at this price, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate with Alice further or explore other options."
