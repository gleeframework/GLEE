"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This price is still well within your perceived value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I'm sticking to my goal of earning as much as possible. $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $975,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm not desperate, and I still have a strong backup option with John. I'm going to try one more round of negotiation with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  $1,000,000 is my final offer.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both parties. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below my target price. I'd like to propose $975,000 one last time. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob at a higher price, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  I've made every effort to negotiate with Bob, but I can't risk further rounds and potentially lose the opportunity to sell to John.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a more secure outcome."
