"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This price is still well within your perceived value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $975,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  $1,000,000 is my final offer.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both parties. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below my target price. I'd like to propose $975,000 one last time. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price.",975000.0,Bob,8,
