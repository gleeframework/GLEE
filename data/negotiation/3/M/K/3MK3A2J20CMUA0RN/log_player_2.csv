"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm looking for $10000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. Would you like to make it yours? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $10,000 and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for that price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. It's a neutral outcome.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice if you reject her offer, but there's no guarantee."
