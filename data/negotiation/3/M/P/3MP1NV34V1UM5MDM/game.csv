,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $10,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $10,000. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $11,000? This would still be a significant saving for you compared to what it's worth. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this compromise?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,800.  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $10,700, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",10700.0,Bob,6,
