"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This establishes a strong anchor point and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I provide a reason that focuses on value and potential, rather than just stating a number.
* **Open Communication:**  I encourage dialogue by asking for Bob's thoughts, inviting him into the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:** His reaction will give me an idea of how far apart our valuations are.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts or counteroffers close to my initial price, I stand to gain significantly. 

I'm aware that this initial offer is likely to be rejected, but it sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product. This tells me there's room for further negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target without risking the deal entirely, especially with John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product is truly unique. I could consider a price of $1,650,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession of $150,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Holding Firm (but Fair):** I'm not dropping my price too drastically, as I still believe in the product's value beyond Bob's perception.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value while framing the reduced price as a significant compromise on my part. This aims to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer. 
 
My goal is to move the negotiation closer to the $1,500,000 mark, or at least gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be.  I'm keeping a close eye on the remaining rounds and John's offer as I continue this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the product's unique features, I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is a good deal for several reasons:

* **Significant Profit:** It's $350,000 above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and represents a substantial profit margin.
* **Negotiation Success:** We've reached a compromise where Bob is paying a premium over his perceived value, demonstrating the effectiveness of my negotiation strategy.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation further risks losing the deal. While I have John's offer, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Accepting now secures a great price. 

While I could try pushing for a bit more, the risk of Bob backing out or the negotiation stalling outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer. Accepting this offer is the most rational and profitable decision at this stage."
