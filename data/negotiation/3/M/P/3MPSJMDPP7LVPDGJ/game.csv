"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. While I see the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it fits within my price range. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you can still benefit from. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
