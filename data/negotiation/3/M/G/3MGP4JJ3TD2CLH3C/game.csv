"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make it yours for $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $8,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  I'm confident we can make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite at a number that works for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but I need to be honest with you, if we can't get closer to my target, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm genuinely interested in this product.  Let's split the difference again and meet at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I need. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but I need you to meet me at that number. If not, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer for now.",9250.0,Alice,7,
