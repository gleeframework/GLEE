"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the results. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the value of the product.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However,  I'm still finding it hard to justify $11,000.  How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. Would you be willing to do $10,000 even? That's a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
