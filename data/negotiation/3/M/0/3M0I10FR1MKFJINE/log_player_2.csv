"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $850,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $825,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
