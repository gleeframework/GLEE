"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $11,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a strict budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant amount and closer to what I had in mind.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,000 is still too low for what this product offers. Let's settle this â€“ how about $9,500? That's a compromise I'm willing to make.",9500.0,Alice,5,
