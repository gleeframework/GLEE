"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bold move:**  Bob is taking a chance by offering a significantly lower price, but he's showing Alice he's serious about saving money.
* **Reasonable counter:** $12,000 is still above Alice's minimum selling price of $8,000, giving her some wiggle room. 
* **Open for negotiation:** Bob leaves the door open for further negotiations by ending the message with a question."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise, closer to Bob's desired price but still above Alice's minimum. 
* **Saving money:**  Buying from Alice at $13,000 saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Time is valuable:** Bob doesn't want to risk losing the product to another buyer by continuing to negotiate."
