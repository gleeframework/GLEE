"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000 for the product.  It's still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $1200000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the value of the product and provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and $1050000 is getting closer to where I want to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1000000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
