Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my desired value ($1,200,000) while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fairness emphasis:** Mentioning ""fair price"" can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing his chances of accepting.
* **Open communication:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also allowing for a possible compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950000 for the product.  It's still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $1200000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While it's true that I value the product at $1,200,000, that's my personal value, not necessarily its market value. I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,100,000. 

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's drastically lower than my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and provides a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly reject it, stating my reasons.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000).
* **Fairness emphasis:**  Again, I emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing opportunity:** I'm highlighting this offer as a potential way to finalize the deal. 

This approach aims to push for a more favorable price while maintaining a cooperative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and $1050000 is getting closer to where I want to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1000000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now aligned with the value he places on the product.  While it's still $200,000 lower than my personal value, it's a fair deal considering the negotiation process.  Continuing to negotiate might prolong the process and risk losing him as a buyer. 

Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and avoid further negotiations, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a failed deal.  This ensures a quick and successful transaction, achieving a good outcome."
