I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,800.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and closer to my target than selling to John.  It's important to remember that negotiations are a give-and-take, and sometimes it's best to settle for a good deal rather than risk losing the sale completely."
