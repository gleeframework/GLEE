"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation to leave room for compromise.  I'm also leaving myself room to make a counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $80 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still trying to get a bit more than Bob's initial offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his price, and I've already made concessions.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's taking time and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. John is offering my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him to avoid further haggling."
