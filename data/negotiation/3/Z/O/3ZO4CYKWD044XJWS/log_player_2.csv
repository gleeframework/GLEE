# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will benefit your business significantly. My initial asking price is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness in negotiating.  
* **Justification:**  The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the potential benefits for both parties.
* **Room for Negotiation:** It leaves some room for Alice to counter without going below your maximum budget of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and it reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue to work together to find a price that works for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This offer reflects the value I place on this product and is a significant step towards finding common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a compromise from my previous offer and is very close to your last one.  Let's close this deal and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're making progress! I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but that's still a bit out of my range. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're very close to finalizing this deal!  To show my commitment to making this happen, I'm willing to come down to $940,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  There's a small chance that Alice might come down to $925,000 or even lower, especially since she's already agreed to meet you halfway in the past.  By rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer, you can try to get the price closer to your target. You have a few rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth pushing for that final reduction."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're both so close! To make this deal a reality, I'm willing to offer $930,000. This is my final offer, and it represents a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident that this price will work for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize this deal today."", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

* **Urgency:** The message hints at wanting to close the deal today, pushing for a quick decision.

At this point, you're very close to your target price. It's worth risking a rejection to see if Alice will come down to $925,000 or even lower.  If she rejects, you can always go with John's offer."
