"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?  It's a fair compromise that still allows us both to get a good deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. How about we try to find a compromise at $1,325,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think that's as high as I can go.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway *one more time*. Let's settle on $1,312,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",1312500.0,Alice,5,
