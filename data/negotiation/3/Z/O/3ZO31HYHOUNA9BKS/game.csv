"Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, but I'm not quite ready to drop down to $9500. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm not sure if there's any room for further compromise. $9000 is really pushing the limits of what I'm willing to accept. But I want to make this work. How about we settle on $9750?  It's a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,7,

"I've already offered $9000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000. Is $9000 a price you're willing to accept?",9000.0,Bob,8,
