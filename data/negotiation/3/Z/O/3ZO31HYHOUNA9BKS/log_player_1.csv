Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $9,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial target of $12,000.  I'll counter with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, but I'm not quite ready to drop down to $9500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident it's a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is still a decent amount, but I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $8,000. I'm going to try to push Bob a bit further to see if I can close the deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm not sure if there's any room for further compromise. $9,000 is really pushing the limits of what I'm willing to accept. But I want to make this work. How about we settle on $9,750?  It's a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already offered $9000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000. Is $9000 a price you're willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his offer, and I'm worried that if I keep negotiating, I might lose out on this deal entirely.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than nothing."
