"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think the product is worth less than you're asking. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, but I think that's as low as I can go.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think you're a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to come down to $1500000 is too low, but I'll go to $1550000",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit too far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $1450000, but that's as low as I can go.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, but I'm also willing to throw in an additional $50000 to sweeten the deal. So, I'm offering $1350000 for the product.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional incentive, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $1400000, and I'll consider the $50000 bonus you're offering, but I need to get closer to the value I know this product has.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Alice, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1300000. I'm willing to throw in the additional $50000 I mentioned earlier, so the total price would be $1350000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need you to meet me at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,10,
