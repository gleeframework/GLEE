"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This sets a high starting point and gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $11,500 is still a bit lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I'm hoping to get closer to that by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not desperate enough to settle for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $12,000 at this point. I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation, or I can always sell to John.  I'm not going to rush into a decision that leaves me unhappy with the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum price, and I'm confident that Bob is willing to pay it. I'm hoping that he will see that I'm serious about this price and that I'm not willing to go any lower. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John and be done with it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous. It's clear he's trying to lowball me, and I'm not going to play this game any longer.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This is the best option for me, as it guarantees me a fair price and ensures that I don't have to waste any more time with Bob."
