"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is close, but to be frank, I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000. To make this worthwhile for me, I need to be at least above that. How about we settle at $1,125,000? This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so how about $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Bob,6,
