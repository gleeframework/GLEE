"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good deal. I'm also aware of John's offer, which acts as my safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm aiming to find a price that is fair for both of us and avoids the need to go through further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is tempting, I believe we can still reach a more agreeable price.  There are still several rounds left, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to find a more balanced compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,000,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still within a range where I feel comfortable with the deal. We're getting closer to a middle ground, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum,  I believe we can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and shows I'm willing to compromise.  With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this will be close enough for Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $890,000 is tempting, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John.  I think I can squeeze a little more out of Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's the most I'm willing to go. With only one round left, I'm hoping this will be enough for Bob to finally accept the deal. If he doesn't, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to what John is offering, but it's still a loss for me.  I would rather take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk another round of negotiation with Bob, where there's no guarantee we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
