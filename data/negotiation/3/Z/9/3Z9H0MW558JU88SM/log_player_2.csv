"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  $12,000 is still a significant savings for Bob, but he has room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially get a slightly lower price, $11,000 is a good deal for him, saving him $4,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant enough savings to justify the risk of Alice walking away."
