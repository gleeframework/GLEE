Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer this product to you. I believe it creates significant value, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it at $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale to John).
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000 creates a potential win-win. 
* **Choosing $1,150,000:** This price gives Bob a fair deal while still securing a significant profit for Alice. It leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, aiming for the highest possible price while staying within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value maximizes Alice's potential profit."
