Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a safety net with John ($15,000), so you don't need to go below that.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.  
* **Leaving room for adjustment:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always lower it slightly, still aiming to stay above your minimum.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
