"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This allows for a substantial margin for you while still ensuring a fair return for me.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's simply not enough for me to let go of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me a reasonable profit while offering you a significant value.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that would allow us to reach an agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  To make progress, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and leaves a good margin for you.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $925,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,000,000. I'm thinking of a price of $962,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. What are your thoughts?",962500.0,Bob,8,
