Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This allows for a substantial margin for you while still ensuring a fair return for me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and I can always sell to John for $800,000 if necessary.  I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's simply not enough for me to let go of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me a reasonable profit while offering you a significant value.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that would allow us to reach an agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have several rounds remaining and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'm going to try and push Bob a bit higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  To make progress, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and leaves a good margin for you.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful that I can push Bob up a bit more. I have four rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can close the deal for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $925,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,000,000. I'm thinking of a price of $962,500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $962,500 is tempting, I'm running out of time. With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee he'll accept.  

Considering the time constraint and the fact that I can sell the product to John for $800,000, it's the safer option.  I'd rather guarantee a sale than risk ending up with nothing in the final round."
