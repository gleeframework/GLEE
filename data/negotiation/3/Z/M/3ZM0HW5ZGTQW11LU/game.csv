"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $720,000?",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $810,000? This is a small concession on my end, reflecting our progress in the negotiation.",810000.0,Alice,5,
