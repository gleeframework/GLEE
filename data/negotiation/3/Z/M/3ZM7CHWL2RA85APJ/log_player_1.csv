Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great value considering its potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This is my opening offer. I'm starting high, knowing I have room to negotiate. I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest by being friendly and emphasizing the value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly less than my desired price. I believe I can get a better deal. I will reject his offer and try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 is significantly below the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000,  but I'm firm on that price.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1700000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm now at a point where I can either accept this offer or sell to John for the same price. It's better to close the deal with Bob now and avoid further negotiation."
