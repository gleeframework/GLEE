Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($10,000) but still lower than my minimum value ($15,000). 
* This offer allows for potential negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer. 
* It's important to sound positive and encouraging while setting a firm price. 
*  If Bob rejects, I have the option to counter or sell to John, ensuring I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired value by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500** is a compromise price that is halfway between Bob's offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($12,000).
* I'm emphasizing my willingness to be flexible, but I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
*  I'm aiming for a price that is still acceptable to me while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $15,000,  it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob.  At this point, it's worth accepting to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation. It's also possible that I could face further counteroffers and ultimately end up with a lower price than this."
