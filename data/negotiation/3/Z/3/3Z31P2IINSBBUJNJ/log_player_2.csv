"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a lower price. You've got 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting the offer and trying to get a better deal makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  This is a strong opening move to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly.  If she rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffers in the next rounds based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still pushing for a better price.  This is a middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice than my initial $10,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still coming down, but not by much.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to be careful not to run out of time. I'll try to inch closer to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm making a small jump up from my last offer.  Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $11,000, and I'm hoping that this offer is close enough to her bottom line to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to squeeze a bit more out of me.  I'll counter one more time to see if I can budge her. If not, I'm getting close to the point where it might make sense to just buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm getting closer to Alice's last offer, but still trying to save a little bit more. This is a good compromise and if Alice rejects it, I'll probably just go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,937.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

We are getting very close to Alice's bottom line, but it's getting risky.  We are in the 9th round, and if Alice rejects this offer, we will only have one more round left.  This means there's no room to negotiate any further. Given the limited time and the fact that we're nearing my maximum budget, it's the best decision to buy from John.  While I'm not getting the best possible price, at least I'm guaranteed to get the product."
