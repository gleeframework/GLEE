"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value to me is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,000?  It's a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $9,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value to me is $12,000.",9750.0,Alice,5,
