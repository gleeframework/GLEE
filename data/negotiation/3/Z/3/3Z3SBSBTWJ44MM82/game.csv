"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is far below what I need to sell.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a good compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
