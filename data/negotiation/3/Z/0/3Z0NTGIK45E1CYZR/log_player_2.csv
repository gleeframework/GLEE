"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a product worth $8,000 to you for a lower price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
