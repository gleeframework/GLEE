Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we want to start by anchoring the negotiation at a higher price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""significant value,"" we're subtly implying the price is justified without revealing our true bottom line. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially reveal more about his position.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice might adjust the price slightly downward in subsequent negotiations. However, she should avoid going below $15,000 to ensure a profit."
