Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below our minimum price. 

By starting the negotiation at $140, we increase the chances of a sale to Bob at a price that's still very profitable for us."
