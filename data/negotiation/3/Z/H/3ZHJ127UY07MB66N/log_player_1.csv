"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value of the product, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to John immediately would be a better option, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 to try and meet in the middle.  This price is still very fair considering the potential value this product offers.  I believe we can find common ground here.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'm going to try to push Bob a little further in the next round. There's a good chance we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000.

Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement before I consider selling to John. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,400,000 at this point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but this is my final offer.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get a higher price, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal with John. It's time to accept the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid further negotiation."
