"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 to try and meet in the middle.  This price is still very fair considering the potential value this product offers.  I believe we can find common ground here.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but this is my final offer.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  It's time to make a decision, as I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
