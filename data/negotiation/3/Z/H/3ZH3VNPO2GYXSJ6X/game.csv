"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far from that price.  Would you consider $10,500? That's a significant jump from my last offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $10,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? It's a fair price that respects both our positions.  Let's make this happen.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us and we can wrap this up.",11000.0,Bob,6,
