Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $14,500 is above your minimum of $12,000.
* **Lower than Bob's maximum:** $14,500 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob some wiggle room to counter-offer, allowing for a potential mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is higher than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation with Bob to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $13,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:**  This offer is closer to Bob's offer and shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a profit margin:**  This price still ensures you earn a decent profit, exceeding your minimum of $12,000.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's still not comfortable with the price, allowing for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,200? It's a bit closer to my target price, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired profit:**  While $13,200 is not your ideal price, it's only $200 less than your previous counteroffer and still a significant profit above your minimum of $12,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Further negotiation may lead to a better price, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, leaving you with only the $12,000 offer from John.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing negotiations might prolong the process, potentially impacting your overall earnings. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
