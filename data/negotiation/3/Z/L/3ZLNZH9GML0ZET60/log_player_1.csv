Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 19000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility (""open to discussing"") and doesn't anchor directly to Bob's perceived value. This encourages Bob to counter-offer, rather than outright rejecting the initial price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob might not counter-offer and go for the guaranteed $10,000 elsewhere. However, the potential to earn significantly more (up to $4,000 extra) justifies the initial high offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance, you might adjust the initial offer."
