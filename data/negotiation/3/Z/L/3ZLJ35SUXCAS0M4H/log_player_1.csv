""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer appealing enough to accept. 

* **Starting High:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed offer ($1,300,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment even at a price higher than his initial valuation.

**Outcome:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $1,300,000, exceeding Bob's valuation and giving you a good profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** You accept John's offer, securing your minimum desired price."
