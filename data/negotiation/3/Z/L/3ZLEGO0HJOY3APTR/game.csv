"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we settle at $9,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
