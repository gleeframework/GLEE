"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if a better deal can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible. A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and leaves some room for negotiation. This price is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, so there's a chance she might accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a price closer to his limit. There's also the risk that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice might become more willing to negotiate in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is still significantly below Alice's offer and closer to Bob's budget, making it a reasonable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is now within Bob's budget. Although it's not ideal, it's only $20,000 more than Bob's maximum budget. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice might become more firm or even reject further counteroffers.  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of not getting the product and secures a deal that's still relatively close to Bob's target price."
