"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better.  You know John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, meaning there's room for negotiation with Alice."
