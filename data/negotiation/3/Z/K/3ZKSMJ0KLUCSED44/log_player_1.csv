{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still gives him some room to negotiate. It also leaves me room to lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum threshold.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and it's clear he's trying to get a good deal. I'm not willing to sell for that low, but I also don't want to lose him as a buyer completely. I'll counter his offer with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to go down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $97 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm not willing to go that low, especially since John is ready to pay my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm keeping John as a safe option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $97 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer, as I'm also speaking with another buyer who's willing to pay my full asking price. Let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
