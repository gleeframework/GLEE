"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  $11,000 is cutting it too close.  What if we settled on $12,500?  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
