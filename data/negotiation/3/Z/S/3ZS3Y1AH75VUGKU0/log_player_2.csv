# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration of its value and your potential interest, we are offering the product to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that is worth $1,000,000 to you at a significant discount. We believe this offer presents a unique chance for both parties to benefit. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while saving $50,000. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price, and going with John means you'll spend your entire budget."
