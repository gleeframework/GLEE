"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask.  This product has considerable value that I'm confident will bring you substantial benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $2,000,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
