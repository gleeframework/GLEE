Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. Considering its value, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $920000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. Although you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise or you might run out of time. Accepting the offer at $920,000 is a good deal considering your maximum budget and the possibility of having to buy from John for $1,200,000."
