{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message acknowledges Bob's ability to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my starting offer of $12,000 and still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to Increase the Price:** I can likely counter with a price closer to my initial offer and still have room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer Provides Leverage:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 sale with John, so I don't need to accept Bob's low offer immediately."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer at $10,500. This is a compromise, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  The message is positive and suggests further negotiation, keeping the door open. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring a profit if accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $10500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product for $9800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Still Too Low:** While closer to my desired price, $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price.
* **Leverage:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,150.  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move the product without taking a significant loss.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final counteroffer at $10,150, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer but still above Bob's last offer. 
* **Fair Price:** The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties, making it less about personal gain and more about finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **End of Negotiations:** I'm suggesting this is my final offer, indicating that I'm nearing the end of my negotiation with Bob.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring a profit if accepted."

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.
* **No Further Negotiation Room:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and the best option at this point."
