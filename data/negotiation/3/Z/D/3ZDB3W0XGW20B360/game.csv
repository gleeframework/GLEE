"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's try to make this happen.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop to $125.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $120, which is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals. Let's see if we can agree on this.",120.0,Bob,6,
