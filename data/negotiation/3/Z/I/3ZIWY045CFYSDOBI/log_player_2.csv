"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price that I think is fair and would allow us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, you're willing to pay up to $15,000. Her offer of $12,000 falls within your budget and saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John."
