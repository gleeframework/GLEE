"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which reflects the value of the product for both of us. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $825000. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
