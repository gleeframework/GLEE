"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This initial offer is aggressive, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000 as that leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to frame the offer as fair and reasonable, which helps build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I believe I can get more by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the value of the product for both of us. This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $825000. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is close enough to my desired price point and allows me to make a profit.  While I'd prefer more, continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a successful sale."
