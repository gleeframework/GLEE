"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is above my minimum but allows room for negotiation. This price is high enough to hopefully encourage Bob to counteroffer and reveal some information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130 as my counteroffer. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's a compromise from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the game.  To avoid the risk of a counteroffer that might be lower or a scenario where Bob walks away, I'll accept his offer."
