"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
