# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob offers a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still represents a potential profit for Alice. This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
