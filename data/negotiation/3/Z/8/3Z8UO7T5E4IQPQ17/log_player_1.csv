Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum desired value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly and engaging tone can help build rapport with Bob and increase the chances of a successful negotiation. 
* **Clear offer:** The message clearly states the price I'm offering and invites Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum desired value of $150. 
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:**  I can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Sell to John is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is still a good deal, if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's closer to his price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin for myself.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I emphasize ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  While $140 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my minimum. This allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm really interested in the product and want to make a deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is still below my minimum desired value of $150.
* **Time is valuable:**  I've already engaged in several rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John for $150 is a safe and profitable option, as it meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, potentially wasting more time and ending up with a lower price."
