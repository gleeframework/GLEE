"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,500. How about we try $10,750? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $10,750 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle between $10,250 and $10,500? Would you consider $10,375?",10375.0,Alice,5,
