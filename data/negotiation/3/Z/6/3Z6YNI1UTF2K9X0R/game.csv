"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800000 is far below the product's true value. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $950000.  This would be a significant savings for you and still allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
