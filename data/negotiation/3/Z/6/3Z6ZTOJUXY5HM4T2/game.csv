"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize the deal and move forward.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $8,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,6,
