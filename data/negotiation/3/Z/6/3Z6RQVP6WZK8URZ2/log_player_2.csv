"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $8,000. By offering $9,000, he shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential concessions. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering its value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget.  He can potentially negotiate further, so rejecting the offer allows him to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small concession by increasing his offer to $9,500.  He's trying to meet Alice halfway while still staying within his budget. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, potentially increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can still get the product for $8,000 from John. It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice, as there's a guaranteed lower price available elsewhere. Bob prioritizes saving the most money, and buying from John achieves that goal."
