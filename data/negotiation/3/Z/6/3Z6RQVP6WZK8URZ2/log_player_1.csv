{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is based on a few key considerations:

* **Your minimum:**  You want at least $15,000, but that's your absolute minimum. 
* **Bob's value:**  You know Bob values it at $8,000, so you want to go higher than that.
* **Negotiation space:** A $12,000 offer leaves room for negotiation but still gets you closer to your ideal price.  

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal considering its value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still want to get a price that reflects the product's worth. This offer gives Bob a better price than before, but it also keeps me closer to my desired amount. Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is a bit closer to my ideal price, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I won't settle for significantly less than $10,000."

``` 

I've decided to make one last counteroffer at $10,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it still gets me closer to my desired price. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
