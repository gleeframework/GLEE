"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a great starting point. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has great potential, but $800,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle around $650,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $725,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $725,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could we possibly agree on $680,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $680,000. I'll counteroffer at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",700000.0,Alice,5,
