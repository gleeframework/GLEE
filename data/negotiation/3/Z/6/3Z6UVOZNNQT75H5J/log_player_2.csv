"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a great starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $725,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $680,000. I'll counteroffer at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

This seems like a good time to accept.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer and while we could push further, there's no guarantee she'll budge much, if at all. $700,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer and provides a good balance between our ideal price and the risk of losing the deal."
