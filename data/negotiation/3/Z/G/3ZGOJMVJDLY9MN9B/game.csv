"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm a bit of a budget shopper, and I'm trying to save some money. Can you meet me in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $80, which would be $82.50. Can you consider that?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $82.50. How about we meet in the middle again, this time at $86.25? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",86.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $86.25. I'll meet you at $83.75, which is another $2.50 less than your last offer. Can you consider that?",83.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your latest offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. How about we meet in the middle again, this time at $84.75? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",84.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $84.75, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we try $84.25? It's just $0.50 less than your offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one more time.",84.25,Bob,8,
