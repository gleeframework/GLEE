"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $145. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $130. Can you do that for me?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to work with you. However, $130 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $135. That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at that price",135.0,Bob,6,
