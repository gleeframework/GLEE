{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone can encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" can make the price seem more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy.
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale above my minimum. 
* If the negotiation drags on, I'll consider selling to John for $150 to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum of $150, and doesn't reflect the value I place on the product. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Opportunity to Counter:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows interest. I can use this opportunity to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price higher than $120 but lower than my initial $175. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum of $150. 
* I'll continue to monitor the negotiation and be prepared to sell to John if the deal with Bob falls through."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $145. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while protecting my profit.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the compromise to make the price seem reasonable and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and friendly.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale close to my minimum.
* **Counter-Offer:** If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next offer and decide whether to accept or counter again. 
* **Plan B:** If the negotiation stalls, I'll be prepared to sell to John at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $130. Can you do that for me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Loss:** Accepting his offer would lead to a significant loss for me. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** It's possible Bob might be willing to go higher if I reject his current offer and make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter with a Higher Price:** I will make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $150. I might offer $140, for example, showing continued willingness to compromise but protecting my profit.
* **Selling to John:** I will keep the option of selling to John for $150 in mind if the negotiation with Bob continues to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to work with you. However, $130 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing my ground by refusing the $130 offer but showing flexibility by offering a slight reduction to $140. This shows I'm serious about getting a fair price while remaining open to a deal.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the ""value of the product"" to justify my price point. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm framing the $140 offer as a ""fair price"" and a ""compromise,"" making it more appealing to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale slightly below my initial goal but still above my minimum.
* **Consider Alternatives:** If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next offer and weigh it against my minimum price and the option of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $135. That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at that price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $135 is only $15 away from my minimum price of $150.  
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  We're now at a point where further negotiation may lead to a stalemate or further price concessions from me.  
* **Guarantee Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure this guaranteed profit than risk a further decline in price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:** I will immediately reach out to John and finalize the sale at $150."
