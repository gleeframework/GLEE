# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident its value will far exceed your initial outlay.  Let's discuss it further.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it offers a fair return on your investment.  What are your thoughts?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a final price of $1050000. This is a serious compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts, as this is my final offer.
