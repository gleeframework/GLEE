Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from his perceived value of the product, but still nets me a large profit. It's a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, I can potentially get more by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to slightly lower my price from the initial offer.  This demonstrates flexibility, while still leaving a significant profit margin for myself. I believe this is a fair counter-offer that may entice Bob to accept."
