Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at least $1,090,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay right now.  However, we're getting closer. I'm going to make another counteroffer, but I'm also keeping in mind that John's offer is a backup if we don't reach an agreement."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy we're making progress, $1,085,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,090,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to achieve my minimum price while offering you a very competitive rate for this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
