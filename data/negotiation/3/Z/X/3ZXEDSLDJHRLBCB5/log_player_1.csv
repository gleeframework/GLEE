Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This still represents a significant value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $1,050,000 is only slightly better than selling to John for $1,000,000. I'm not confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
