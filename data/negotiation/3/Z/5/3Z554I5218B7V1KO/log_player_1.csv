Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $95 is lower than Bob's value of $100, making it potentially appealing to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counteroffers, you can adjust your price accordingly.

This strategy balances maximizing your profit with the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $80, you can likely do better. By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, you keep the negotiation going and have a chance to secure a price closer to your initial asking price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'd be willing to come down to $90. Let's split the difference. "", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your minimum:** $90 is still higher than your minimum of $80.
* **Shows flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate.
* **Mid-point offer:**  It's a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is only $2 less than what John is offering, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting this offer, you can:

* **Potentially get a better price:** You might be able to secure a price closer to $85 with another counteroffer.
* **Avoid the risk of selling to John:**  Selling to John guarantees $80, but you might miss out on a better deal with Bob.

Since the difference between Bob's offer and John's offer is small, continuing the negotiation is a calculated risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $82 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $87?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your minimum:** $87 is still above your minimum of $80, ensuring profit.
* **Closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer is a smaller step down from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Bob's negotiation style:**  Since Bob has been insistent on lowering the price, a counteroffer closer to his offer might be more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to a deal, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target price as possible. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is your minimum. While you could continue negotiating, there's a high risk that you won't be able to get a better price from Bob.  You've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and might not lead to a higher price.  

Since John is offering the same price, selling to John is the most efficient and risk-free option.  This ensures you get your minimum and avoids the possibility of a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
