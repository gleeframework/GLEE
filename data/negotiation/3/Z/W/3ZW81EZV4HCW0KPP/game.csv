"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'd like to offer $1000000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1100000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make a further concession. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets your budget.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
