Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a very high offer ($1,900,000) sets a strong anchor in Bob's mind. Even though it's unlikely he'll accept this initial price, it creates a perception of high value. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This leaves significant room for negotiation. Bob is likely to counter-offer, and Alice can gradually lower the price, still aiming for well above her minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. This allows her to be bolder in her initial ask, as there's less risk of losing the sale entirely.

**Important Note:** This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. It relies on Bob being willing to negotiate and potentially pay a premium. However, with a product valuable to both parties, Alice maximizes her potential profit by aiming high."
