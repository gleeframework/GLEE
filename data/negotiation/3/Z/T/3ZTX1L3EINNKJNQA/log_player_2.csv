"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a bit high, but it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.  I want to see if I can push her lower, especially since she's willing to negotiate. I'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  I'm confident we can close this deal if we find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,037,500. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,037,500 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm also starting to consider buying from John as the deal with Alice is getting closer to his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,037,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,030,000. This is my final offer, and I'm honestly starting to think I may have to go with John's offer.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1030000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,030,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,040,000. This is my final counteroffer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,040,000 is getting very close to John's price of $1,200,000.  With only 3 rounds left, the chances of getting Alice to go lower are slim. It's more efficient to buy from John at this point and avoid further negotiation.  While I'm losing out on a potential $160,000 saving, I'm guaranteed to get the product and avoid the risk of Alice not coming down in price."
