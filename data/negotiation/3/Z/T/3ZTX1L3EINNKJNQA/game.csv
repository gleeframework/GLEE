"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  I'm confident we can close this deal if we find a mutually agreeable price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
