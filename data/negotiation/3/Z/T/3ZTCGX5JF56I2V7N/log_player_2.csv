"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $12000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get an even better price by negotiating.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $11000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good price. It's likely that further negotiation will result in a very small price reduction, and it's not worth risking the deal by potentially going over Bob's $15,000 limit with John."
