{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is more than Bob thinks the product is worth, so he'll be motivated to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're still above your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation without feeling pressured.
* **It's a reasonable offer:** A $2,000 difference is significant enough to encourage negotiation, but not so large that Bob will immediately reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my budget below $8,000 for this purchase. Would you be willing to consider $9,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room to negotiate. A counteroffer allows me to explore a price closer to my desired range.
* **Potential for higher price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if he's willing to go higher, or if he's firm on his offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose $10,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,500 is still below my minimum of $12,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less just yet.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and increase his offer. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher, especially if he values the product.
* **Jhon is a backup option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in Jhon at $12,000, which gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within $8,000. Could we perhaps agree on $11,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $11,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm not willing to settle for less than my desired price.
* **Stalemate:**  Bob seems unwilling to go any higher, and I've already made several concessions. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Jhon is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to Jhon at $12,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoid further negotiation. 

Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum, the potential for further negotiation is slim, and I have a guaranteed buyer in Jhon. It's more advantageous to sell to Jhon and avoid the risk of a protracted negotiation."
