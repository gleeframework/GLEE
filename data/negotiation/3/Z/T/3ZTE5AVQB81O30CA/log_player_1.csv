Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to maximize your profit while ensuring you don't push Bob so high that he rejects the offer. Since you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, anything above that is a bonus.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can agree on a price that benefits us both. I propose a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing a ""win-win"" situation.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) but a considerable profit for you (+$350,000 compared to John's offer). 

**Important Note:**  This is just one potential offer. There's always room for negotiation. Bob's response might give you clues on whether to slightly adjust the price up or down."
