Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy balances the desire to maximize your earnings with the potential risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price, aiming to secure a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a fair compromise. While it's lower than your initial goal, it's still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price and John's offer. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even losing Bob as a buyer."
