"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
