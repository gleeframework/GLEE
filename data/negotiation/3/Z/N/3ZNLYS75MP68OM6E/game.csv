"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe its value is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My initial price for the product is $2000000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair starting point considering its unique capabilities. Let's talk!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a purchase price not exceeding $500000. I hope we can find common ground and reach an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept for this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe its true value is significantly higher.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to reduce my price to $1250000. This is a substantial compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal for the benefits this product offers.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline the $1250000 offer. I am still looking for a price closer to my maximum limit of $500000. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in between these figures?",625000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to come up slightly. However, $625000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $875000?  This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  If you're truly interested in this product, I encourage you to seriously consider this final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
