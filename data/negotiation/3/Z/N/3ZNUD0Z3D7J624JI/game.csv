"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds immense value for someone with your expertise, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than $1,300,000. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the exclusivity of the offer, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing the product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can derive from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I can derive from it, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
