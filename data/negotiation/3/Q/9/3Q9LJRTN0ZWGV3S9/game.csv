"Alice, your product is interesting, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
