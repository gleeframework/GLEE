Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While I could continue to negotiate, Bob is consistently moving towards a reasonable price. Accepting  $1,109,375 ensures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer significantly in later rounds."
