"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This ensures I don't immediately lose the deal, while also setting a high initial bar.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, and if not, I can gauge his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm flexible and open to negotiation. This also allows me to gauge Bob's reaction and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm running out of rounds, $10,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get closer to $12,000 or higher. If Bob doesn't budge, I can always sell to John in the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still allows for potential negotiation in future rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider selling to John in the next round, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob before resorting to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While time is running out, I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only a few rounds left, I need to make a substantial concession to have a chance of closing the deal with Bob.  $11,000 is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer, and a price I'm willing to accept at this point. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim.  While $9,500 is higher than his initial offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to avoid further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to budge significantly."
