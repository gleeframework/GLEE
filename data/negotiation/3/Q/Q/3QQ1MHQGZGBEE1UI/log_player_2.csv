You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1000000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

While $1,000,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a bit high. You should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While $900000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still need a bit more to make this work.  I'm willing to offer the product for $950000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $950,000 is the closest she's come to your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she might reject your counteroffer and you'll have to buy from John for $800,000.  It's better to secure the product now at a slightly higher price than risk losing it entirely."
