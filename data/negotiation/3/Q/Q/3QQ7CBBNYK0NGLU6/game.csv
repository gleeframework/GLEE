"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the worth of the product to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. This product is highly valuable, and I'm confident it can bring you significant benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but based on my financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $13,500. Would it be possible to negotiate further? Perhaps something around $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While $13,000 is an improvement, I still feel that we can find a mutually beneficial price. Considering my budget, I would like to suggest $12,800 as a compromise.",12800.0,Bob,6,
