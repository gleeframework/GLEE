{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, which gives you the chance to either accept a price closer to your target or make a new counteroffer to close the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than $12,000, it's still below your ideal price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $13,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal on track. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
