Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (your minimum), you have room to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to create a perception that the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The high initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere closer to $1,350,000 - $1,400,000, which is still a significant profit for you. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John.  If Bob knows your minimum price, this approach could backfire."
