Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so this offer gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $15,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This offer is likely to pique Bob's interest without being overly aggressive.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, you can either make a counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and it gets the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
