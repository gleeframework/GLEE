"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counteroffering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price to secure a sale, especially if she values the product at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and it gets the deal done."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer of $11,500 is within Bob's budget of $10,000.**  This means Bob can buy the product without exceeding his limit.
* **While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is a good strategic move.**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  If Bob rejects the offer and continues negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob could end up paying more than $11,500.
* **Buying from John for $10,000 is still an option, but it's not the best choice at this point.**  Bob has the opportunity to get the product for a price closer to his desired limit, and accepting Alice's offer provides a good balance of price and certainty."
