"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and it gets the deal done.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
