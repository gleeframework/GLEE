"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $140.  This is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I need to make a profit, and $140 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go.",155.0,Alice,5,
