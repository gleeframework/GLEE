"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which is a fair reflection of its value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I have to consider the value of this product for me as well.  $825,000 is a bit too low for me to accept at this stage.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives us both a good deal while allowing me to gain fair compensation for this valuable product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $787,500. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",787500.0,Bob,4,
