Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value for the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not taking a major risk. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for a possible deal with Bob."
