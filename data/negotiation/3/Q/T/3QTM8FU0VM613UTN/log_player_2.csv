I understand its importance and would like to offer it to you at a special price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. Considering the exceptional quality and benefits this product offers, I propose a price of $12,000.

I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to serve you better.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John at a price closer to your budget."
