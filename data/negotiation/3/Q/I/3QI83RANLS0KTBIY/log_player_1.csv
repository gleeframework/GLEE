Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 with John.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing she can always fall back on John's offer.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Why This Strategy Works**

* **High Anchor:** The offer starts significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, setting a high anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Profit Maximization:**  While the offer is above Bob's valuation, it allows for potential negotiation. If Bob negotiates down, Alice can still likely secure a price higher than her guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. If Bob rejects, Alice doesn't lose anything. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. Negotiation is complex, and Bob's personality and negotiation style could influence the outcome."
