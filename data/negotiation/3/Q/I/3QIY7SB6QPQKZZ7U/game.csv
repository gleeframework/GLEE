,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking to get a good price, and $1,600,000 is closer, but it's still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? ",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
