"Bob, I understand that you're looking to make a significant investment, but I need to ensure that I get a fair price for the product. Considering your initial offer was lower than my initial price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
