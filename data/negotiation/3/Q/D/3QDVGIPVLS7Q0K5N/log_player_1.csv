**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is only offering $1,000 less than John's guaranteed price.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns, and there's a real risk that Bob will drop his offer further, or that the negotiation might fail altogether. Accepting $16,000 is a safe bet to secure a reasonable profit."
