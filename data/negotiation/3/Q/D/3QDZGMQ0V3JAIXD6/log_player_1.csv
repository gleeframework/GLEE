Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation while staying within a profitable range.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" adds perceived value, making the high price more palatable. 
* **Leaving Bob room:**  Offering at $1,350,000 allows Bob to counter-offer and still feel like he's getting a deal, while ensuring Alice remains well above her minimum acceptable price."
