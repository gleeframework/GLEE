"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $1,350,000, while John is selling for $1,500,000.
* **It's within your budget:** The offer is below your $1,500,000 limit.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $150,000."
