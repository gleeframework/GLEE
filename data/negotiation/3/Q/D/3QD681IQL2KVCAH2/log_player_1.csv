"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is slightly less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum of $120 and closer to my desired price.  There's no guarantee Bob will budge further, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal and ending up with the lower price from John."
