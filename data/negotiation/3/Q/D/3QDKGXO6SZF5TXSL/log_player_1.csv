{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product to Bob for $12,000 (our minimum), there's a chance he'll accept a slightly lower price, netting us a larger profit. 
* **Balance Risk/Reward:** Offering it for significantly less (e.g., $9,000) increases the chance of Bob accepting, but we leave potential profit on the table.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We don't *need* to go below that price.

By offering the product at $11,000, we strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  It's significantly more than the product's worth to him ($8,000), potentially enticing him to accept.
* **Profitable for Alice:**  It ensures a profit of $11,000 - $12,000 (cost to us) = -$1000, which is better than selling it to John for no profit."
