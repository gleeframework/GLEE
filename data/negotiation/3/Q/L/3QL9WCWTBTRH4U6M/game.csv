"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $12,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the best I can do.",12500.0,Alice,5,
