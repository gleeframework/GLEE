"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $80 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120.  That's still a good deal for a product like this, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100.  This would give you a good price, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
