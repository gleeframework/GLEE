"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $130, and I think that's a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Alice,5,
