"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7500. I'm willing to come down to $8200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $8250? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you at $8250, but I'm willing to consider $7800. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this product.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob! $7800 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $8100. It's a bit closer to my target price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $8100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7900. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this product.",7900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $8050. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8050.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $7900, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000. I'm willing to walk away if it's not a good deal for me.",7900.0,Bob,10,
