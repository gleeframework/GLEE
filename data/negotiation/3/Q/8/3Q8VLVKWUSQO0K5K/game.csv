"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,000 to make this work.  Let's find some common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're willing to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
