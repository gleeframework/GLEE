"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to pay a bit closer to its actual worth to me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit away from your offer. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $1,020,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum:** $1,020,000 is only $30,000 more than Bob's ideal price of $990,000 (which is $1,200,000 - $210,000).
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming and uncertain:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting Bob's offer again and potentially increasing her price.  Additionally, time spent negotiating with Alice could be time better spent exploring other options.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice. Bob saves $180,000 compared to buying from John, and the potential for further savings is minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal."
