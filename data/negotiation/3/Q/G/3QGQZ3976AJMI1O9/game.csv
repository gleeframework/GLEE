"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to pay a bit closer to its actual worth to me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit away from your offer. I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $1,020,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1020000.0,Alice,3,
