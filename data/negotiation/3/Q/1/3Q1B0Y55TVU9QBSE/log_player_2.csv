"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than your maximum price of $1,200,000 and therefore a better deal than buying from John. While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer is the most logical choice to save money."
