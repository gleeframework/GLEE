"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, and I want to make this work.  However, $980000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1040000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's work together to close this deal.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1040000. I'm willing to pay $1010000 for the product. This is my best and final offer.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
