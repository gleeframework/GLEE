"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,050,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I want to see if I can push for a better deal.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept anything below $1,000,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise. There are still 6 rounds left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, and I want to make this work.  However, $980,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,040,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1040000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1040000. I'm willing to pay $1010000 for the product. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,010,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, with only 4 rounds left, I don't have the time to risk further negotiations. It's not worth risking a potential deal falling through, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which meets my minimum requirement.  It's better to secure a sure thing than gamble on a potential higher offer in the remaining rounds."
