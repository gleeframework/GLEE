"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $95. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, which would be $97.50. It's a fair price that I think you'll find is worth it for the product. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,5,
