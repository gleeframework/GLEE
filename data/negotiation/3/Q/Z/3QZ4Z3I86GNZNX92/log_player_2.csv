"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I can assure you its worth is significant, exceeding $1000000 to me. I'm confident it will bring substantial benefits to your operations. I'm willing to let you acquire it for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential value. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product's worth is significant, Bob has no way to verify this claim. It's better to reject the offer and buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, ensuring Bob stays within his budget."
