"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we negotiate, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to beat. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the product's true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000, but it's significantly closer and a better deal than buying from John.  By accepting, Bob saves $50,000 compared to John's offer and secures the product.  There's a chance Bob could continue negotiating and get a slightly lower price, but there's also a risk Alice might reject and the deal could fall apart. Accepting Alice's offer minimizes risk and ensures a good deal."
