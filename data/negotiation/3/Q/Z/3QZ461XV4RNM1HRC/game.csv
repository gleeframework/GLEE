"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we negotiate, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to beat. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and still reflects the product's true value.
