"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1200000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, and that's the same price you can get it from John, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You might as well go with John."
