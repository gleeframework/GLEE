Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still keeping you well above your minimum price. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
