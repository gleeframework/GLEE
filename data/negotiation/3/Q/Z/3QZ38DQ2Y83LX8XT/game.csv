"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering my limit.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

Let's close this deal and move forward.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
