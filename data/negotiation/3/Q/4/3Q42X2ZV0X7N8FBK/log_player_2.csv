"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than his own maximum budget. This shows that he's serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further. It's still possible to get a better deal, and he can always choose to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal then."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. He's offering a price that is exactly halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that he is willing to meet halfway and is serious about closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $13,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. If you're truly interested in acquiring it, this is our best and final offer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John and save $5,000."
