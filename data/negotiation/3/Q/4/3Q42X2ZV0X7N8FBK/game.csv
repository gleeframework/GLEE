"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal then.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $13,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. If you're truly interested in acquiring it, this is our best and final offer. Let me know your decision.",13000.0,Alice,5,
