"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

It's not logical to accept Alice's offer of $15,000 when you can get the same product from John for $10,000. Rejecting the offer and going to the next round of negotiations is the better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product.  This is the price I'm willing to pay before I go to John.  It's in Alice's best interest to accept, since she'll still be making a profit, and I'll get the product for my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than my target price of $10,000.  Since I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it makes sense to take that option and avoid further negotiation."
