"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
