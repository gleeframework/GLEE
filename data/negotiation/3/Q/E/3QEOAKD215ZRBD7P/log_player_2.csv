"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm really hoping to get this closer to $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $11,500, which is still a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price.  It's only $1,500 more than Bob's ideal price of $10,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice could reject his counteroffer, and he'd end up paying John the full $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal and avoids that risk."
