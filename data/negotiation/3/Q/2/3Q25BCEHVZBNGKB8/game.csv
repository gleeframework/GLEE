"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I still believe the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
