"Alice, $18,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $13,000.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $13,000 is your maximum, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. The product is worth $15,000 to me, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount to make the deal happen. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
