"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1250000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, but that's my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1000000 to facilitate a deal. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
