# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1000000 to facilitate a deal. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
