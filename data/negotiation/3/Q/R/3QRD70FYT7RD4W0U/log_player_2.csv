Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,100.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $13,000.  It's unlikely she'll budge further, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting her offer means overpaying.  Buying from John guarantees the best price at $12,000."
