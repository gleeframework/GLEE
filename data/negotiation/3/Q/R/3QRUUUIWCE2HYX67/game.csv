"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,175,000? ",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
