"I'm interested in the product, but I think $850,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique product.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $775,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go that low. To be fair, how about we settle for $790,000? It's a good compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for both of us.",790000.0,Alice,5,
