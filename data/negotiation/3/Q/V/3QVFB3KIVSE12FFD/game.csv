"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but I'm only willing to pay a fair price.  How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response.  I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle a bit, how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit too steep for me. Let's try $8,000, would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $8,000 is still quite low considering what you'll gain from this product.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
