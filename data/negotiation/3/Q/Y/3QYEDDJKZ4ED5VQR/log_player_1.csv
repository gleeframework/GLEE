Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer of $1,000,000 allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), inviting Bob to counter-offer and begin a discussion. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest in the product."
