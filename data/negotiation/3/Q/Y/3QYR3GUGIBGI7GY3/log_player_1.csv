"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know the product is worth $150 to me, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum.  $175 is a fair compromise, hopefully Bob will see that and agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $140 is close to my minimum, but I think I can get a little more. I'll reject the offer and see if I can push for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for my minimum price, but I won't go lower. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I've already reached my minimum price.  It's better to sell to John and get my desired price."
