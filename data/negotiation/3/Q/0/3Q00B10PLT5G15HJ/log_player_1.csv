``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This price is higher than what it's worth to him, but it's lower than what I'd get from John. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I was hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price, I'm running out of time and negotiation space with Bob.  John is offering me a guaranteed price that meets my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
