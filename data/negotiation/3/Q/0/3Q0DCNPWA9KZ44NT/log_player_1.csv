"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point.  I'm also trying to be friendly and create a good rapport with Bob to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer. I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about making a deal and that we're close to an agreement."
