"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so there's room for both of you to find a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and she's willing to sell for $8,000, so a price closer to $11,000 could still be beneficial for both of you."
