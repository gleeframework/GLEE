"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This is because:

* **It's above my minimum value:** I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, so this price leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's an aggressive starting point:** This might encourage Bob to counteroffer quickly, giving me a chance to understand his perceived value of the product. 

I'm willing to go through multiple rounds of negotiation, but I'm also aware that John is a backup buyer, so I won't be afraid to walk away if the price doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push the price up further. Since I have 8 more rounds, I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering that Bob has shown interest in the product and that I still have plenty of negotiation rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum value and significantly closer to my ideal price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $10,000 would leave me with less profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point."
