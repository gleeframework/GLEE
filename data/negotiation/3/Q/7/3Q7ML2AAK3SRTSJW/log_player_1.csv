Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not budging much on his offer. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price, and it's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with Bob."
