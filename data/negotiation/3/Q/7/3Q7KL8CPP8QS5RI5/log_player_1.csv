Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens the door for a counter-offer. You can then gradually lower the price, aiming for a price point that's still profitable for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives you a strong fallback position. You don't have to settle for anything less than that amount. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's reaction and any counter-offers he might make."
