Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves space for negotiation. This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle the price down, even if it's still significantly higher than his initial valuation.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely alludes to the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" without revealing specifics.  This is a common negotiation tactic to justify a high price.

**Goal:** 

The objective is to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value closer to your minimum acceptable price. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a high chance of securing a deal significantly above his initial $800,000 valuation and potentially closer to your $1,500,000 safety net."
