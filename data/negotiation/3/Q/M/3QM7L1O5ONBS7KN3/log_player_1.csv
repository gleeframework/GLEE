"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us and allows you to acquire a valuable product without breaking the bank. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer of $10,000. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to get closer to your target price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $10,500?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum, and I'm worried that if I reject his offer again, he might walk away entirely. It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether."
