"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us and allows you to acquire a valuable product without breaking the bank. Let's make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your offer of $10,000. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you want to get closer to your target price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
