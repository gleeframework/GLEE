"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer of $140 leaves room for negotiation. You know you have a maximum budget of $150 and John will sell it for that price. By negotiating with Alice, you may be able to secure a price closer to her value of $120, saving you some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit high for me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle? "",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Aiming lower than your actual top price gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting a price point between your initial offer and Alice's starting price can make the offer seem more appealing and encourage a quick agreement.
* **Leaving Room:**  While $125 is a good starting point, it leaves you with the option to increase your offer slightly if Alice pushes back."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet somewhere in the middle of the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and while $132.5 is closer to your counter-offer, there's still room for improvement. You're getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's worth seeing if Alice will come down a little further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. I'm aiming for something closer to $120, could you meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  It's time to be more direct about your target price.  You've countered twice, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:** By stating your desired price outright ($120), you're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Leaving Minimal Wiggle Room:** While you've stated your desired price, Alice might counter with a slightly higher amount. You can still choose to accept a price a little above $120 if necessary, but this puts the pressure on her to make a compelling offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $127.5 is a reasonable compromise. You're saving $22.5 compared to buying from John, and Alice is likely close to her bottom line.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. The potential savings at this point are likely not worth the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
