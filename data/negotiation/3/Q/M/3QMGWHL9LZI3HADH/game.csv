"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a more substantial counteroffer. How about $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1600000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $1750000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1700000. I'd like to meet you at $1700000, but I'm willing to go as high as $1700500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1725000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. How about $1700000?",1700000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $1700000, Bob. I think we've had a good negotiation, and I'm willing to meet you at $1720000. This is my last offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the product.",1720000.0,Alice,9,
