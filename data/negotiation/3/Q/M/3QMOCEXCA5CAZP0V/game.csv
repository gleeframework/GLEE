"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to a price point where you can make this work. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I think $13,500 is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  $12,000 is really the most I can do.  I understand if that doesn't work for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and my original offer, so I'm offering it to you for $13,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,7,
