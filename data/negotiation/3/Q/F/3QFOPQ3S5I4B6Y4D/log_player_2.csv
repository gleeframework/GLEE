"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's minimum as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000 shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price, but also demonstrates that Bob wants a better deal than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still a good deal, there's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. By offering $1,075,000, Bob shows that he's willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his target. This counteroffer might be appealing to Alice as it's closer to her desired selling price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is only $40,000 higher than Bob's previous counteroffer and is a good deal considering Bob's maximum budget.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget and avoiding the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or a missed opportunity."
