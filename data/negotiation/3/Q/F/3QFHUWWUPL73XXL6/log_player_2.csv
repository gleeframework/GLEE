"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($100 < $120).** 
* **It's cheaper than buying from John.**
* **Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counter-offer and you ending up buying from John for $120 outweighs the potential savings.**"
