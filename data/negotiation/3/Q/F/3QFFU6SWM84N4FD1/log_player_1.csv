This offer allows for potential negotiation while still giving me a good profit margin.  I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product less, but giving him room to counteroffer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate and I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll be firm about my price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not sure $9000 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $9000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8750?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still too low. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm going to hold firm to my minimum price point. I'll make a counteroffer, but I will not go below $9,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $8750. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. I'd like to buy the product from you for $8750.

I'm choosing to sell to John for $10,000.  Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'm confident that selling to John will give me the best outcome in this situation."
