"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is my best offer, and it's still a great deal for both of us given the value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is within my budget and a good deal considering the value of the product to me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
