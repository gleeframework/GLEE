Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies high demand and value by mentioning ""interest"" and not listing it publicly yet.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, even though it's above his perceived value. 

While Bob might reject this initial offer, it positions you strongly to potentially meet in the middle at a price still significantly above your minimum."
