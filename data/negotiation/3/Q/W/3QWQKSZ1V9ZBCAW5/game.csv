"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that the price is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I had budgeted for. Would you consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is the minimum I need to make a profit, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
