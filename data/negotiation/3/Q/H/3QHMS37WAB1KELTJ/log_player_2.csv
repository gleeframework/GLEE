Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the high-quality product you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation: While Alice is coming closer to your budget, she's still offering a price higher than what John will sell the product for. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and you risk running out of rounds and potentially ending up with no deal. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best price for your budget."
