Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand it's valuable to you, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is now offering $140, which is a reasonable profit above your minimum price. While you could try to push for a little more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting the $140 secures a good profit now."
