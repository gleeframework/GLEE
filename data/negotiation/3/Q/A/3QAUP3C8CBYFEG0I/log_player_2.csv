"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:** You'll pay $12,000, which is within your budget of $15,000.
* **Buying from John:** You'll pay $15,000, which is the maximum you're willing to spend.

Since Alice's offer is lower, accepting it will save you $3,000 compared to buying from John."
