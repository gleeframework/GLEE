I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option in John, who is willing to buy the product for $800,000.  This gives me some leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.  I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $1,080,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,120,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I'm still confident I can get a better price than Bob's last offer. I believe this price is reasonable, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still too low for me.  I'm worried that if I continue negotiating with Bob, he might keep lowering his offer, and I might end up selling for less than my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me a price that is above my minimum, and I can't risk losing that opportunity."
