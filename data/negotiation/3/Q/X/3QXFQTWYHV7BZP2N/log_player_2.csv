# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John for $12,000, your maximum budget."
