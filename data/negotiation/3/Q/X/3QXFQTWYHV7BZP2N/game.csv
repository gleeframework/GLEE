"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider selling it for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit too much for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
