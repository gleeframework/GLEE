Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to sell to John.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a few rounds, but we're not getting close enough to my desired price.  While $92 is better than nothing, it's not worth the risk of further rounds of negotiation.  John is offering me a guaranteed $120, which is more than enough."
