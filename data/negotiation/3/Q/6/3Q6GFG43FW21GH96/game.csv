"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $7,750? That's the highest I can go for now.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still open to selling you the product, but $7,750 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs. Let's close this deal! ",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at that price?",7800.0,Bob,6,
