"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise considering my budget and your stated value. I believe this is a reasonable offer for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still too low.  My final offer is $1,300,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your effort to come down in price, $1,300,000 is still too far from my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This represents a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
