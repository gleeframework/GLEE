"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. This is a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9800.0,Alice,5,
