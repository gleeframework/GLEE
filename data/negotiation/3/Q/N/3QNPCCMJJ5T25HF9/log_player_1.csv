Bob's offer:

Explanation:

Bob has consistently shown he's not willing to move substantially closer to a price that reflects the product's value to you. He's made it clear his ""final offer"" is $750,000.  

At this point, continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. It's in your best interest to cut your losses and sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
