"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is a strong opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob won't accept it right away, but it establishes a clear starting point and allows me to gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,200,000.  This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this price is within a reasonable range for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, although it's closer to my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that reflects the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,100,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.  This price is still more than what Bob offered, but it shows that I'm serious about closing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I want to maximize my profit and see if I can get a higher price, even with only a few rounds left. I'll counter again, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,050,000.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a price that's both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me. This offer shows I'm committed to reaching an agreement, but it's still above his last offer, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get a slightly higher price with one more counteroffer. With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision that maximizes my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident it's the best move at this stage.  Bob's offers are steadily increasing, and it's clear that we're getting closer to a deal.  However, I need to close this deal soon to avoid selling to John for a lower price."
