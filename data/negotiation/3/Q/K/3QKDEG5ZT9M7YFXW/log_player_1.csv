"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm looking to get $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly emphasizing the ""amazing"" nature of the product, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 

By starting high, I set the stage for potential bargaining while still leaving myself room to accept a lower price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $100 would guarantee a sale, but I'm not desperate. I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by offering a price closer to his initial counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going smoothly.
* **Target Price:**  $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's also closer to a mutually agreeable price point.

By offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below your target. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal goal.
* **Room for compromise:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to make a final counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John (for now):**  Selling to John would be the safe option, but I'm not desperate to settle for $100.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, hoping to meet him at a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's make this final offer.  How about $100? That's my absolute minimum, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer.
* **Minimum Price:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly implying that I'm ready to move on to other buyers if Bob doesn't accept.

By offering my minimum price and emphasizing the value proposition, I'm hoping to persuade Bob to accept the offer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not seeing a clear path to a deal above my minimum.
* **Too many rejections:** Bob has rejected multiple offers, and his counteroffers are getting increasingly lower. This suggests he might be playing a game of attrition, hoping I'll lower my price out of desperation.
* **John's offer is secure:**  While $100 isn't my ideal price, it's guaranteed.  Selling to John avoids any further risk of  Bob lowering the price even more. 

**Conclusion:**

To avoid potential further losses and guarantee a sale, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100.  While I would have preferred a higher price, securing a sale is more important than chasing a potentially elusive higher offer from Bob."
