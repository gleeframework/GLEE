Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $11,000, you leave a small margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal ($1,000 savings), while you maximize your potential profit. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a fallback option with John."
