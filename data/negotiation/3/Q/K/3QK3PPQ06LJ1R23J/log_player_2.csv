"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $11,000 is lower than your maximum price, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to buy from John for $1,000 less."
