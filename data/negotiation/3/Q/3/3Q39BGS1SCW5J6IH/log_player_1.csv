Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.
