"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiating further if needed.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your desire to pay a fair price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value, and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a compromise that we can both live with.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
