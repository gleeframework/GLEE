"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your valuation, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I respect your position. However, I need to be firm about the product's value.  I'm willing to consider $1,350,000 -  it's my final offer.  It reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope you can understand my position.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
