Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. This is a great deal, so what do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, so offering it for $100 (your minimum) is not ideal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Optional):**  While not explicitly part of the scenario, a price of $125 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer ensures you make a profit above your $100 minimum if Bob accepts. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you are confident in your assessment of Bob's valuation."
