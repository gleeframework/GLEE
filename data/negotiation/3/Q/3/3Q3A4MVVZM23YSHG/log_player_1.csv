Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob's higher valuation allows me to aim for a significantly higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for me while still offering Bob a significant discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **Time Constraint:**  The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept."
