Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000).
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. We don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure a great deal while acknowledging Bob might try to negotiate down slightly."
