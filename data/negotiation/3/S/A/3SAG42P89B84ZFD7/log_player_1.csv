Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This gives Bob a good opportunity to negotiate, while still leaving room for me to potentially make more than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that the product is worth this much to him, and I'm hoping to capitalize on his potential willingness to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's offer.  I think this price is reasonable given Bob's willingness to pay $1,600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,625,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum threshold and a strong indication that Bob values the product highly.  There's always the risk of going back and forth and ultimately ending up with John's offer, so I'm going to take this opportunity to secure a solid profit."
