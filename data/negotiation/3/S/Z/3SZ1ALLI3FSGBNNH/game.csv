"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest in the product and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable solution.  What do you think?",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,040,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet at $1,015,000?",1015000.0,Bob,6,
