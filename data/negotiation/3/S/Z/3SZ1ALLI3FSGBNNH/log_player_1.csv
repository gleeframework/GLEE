{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reason to consider the deal. It's also important to remember that if Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,025,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest in the product and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable solution.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1040000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,040,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet at $1,015,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,015,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that Bob and I are too far apart on price.  Rather than continue a lengthy and potentially futile negotiation, I'm going to accept John's offer to sell the product for $1,500,000.  It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirement."
