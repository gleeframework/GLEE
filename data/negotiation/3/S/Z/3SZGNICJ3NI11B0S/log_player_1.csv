"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I mention the value to both of us, emphasizing that this is a fair deal, not just a random number. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I invite Bob to respond, showing I'm open to finding a compromise. 

**Important Note:** I'm aware of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John. This initial offer sets the stage for future rounds, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. There's a good chance I can get a better price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than my minimum.  I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $950,000? This would allow you to get a great deal while still ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by increasing my offer, but still staying above my minimum price.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  I'm framing this as a joint effort to find a mutually beneficial solution, which can help build rapport.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing that this price is still a good deal for him. 
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I leave the door open for continued discussion, as there are still multiple rounds left."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value it holds for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is inching closer, $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, which gives me ample opportunity to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum price provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired range, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of reaching a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $920,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value.

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility and commitment to finding a deal by raising my offer again.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $930,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and we're now halfway through the negotiation rounds.
* **Time is running out:**  I have 4 rounds left, and while there's still time to negotiate, I want to ensure I get a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum, and I'm becoming increasingly comfortable with that option.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of reaching a mutually agreeable price. I will also be prepared to consider selling to John if Bob's final offer is not satisfactory."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal.  While $930,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $960,000? This is a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement in these final rounds."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:** Time is running out, and I'm using it to my advantage. This offer is closer to Bob's, showing I'm serious about closing a deal.
* **High Stakes:** I've emphasized the ""significant compromise"" to make my offer seem more appealing and to subtly highlight the risk of selling to John.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm re-emphasizing the ""fair price"" and ""value"" aspects, reminding Bob of the potential benefits of a successful negotiation.
* **Finality:** This offer leaves less room for further concessions, pushing Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Prepare for Rejection:** I expect Bob might reject this offer, but I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response.
* **Consider John:** I'll be ready to sell to John if Bob's final offer isn't satisfactory, as time is becoming a significant factor.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** I'll be ready to make a final, potentially lower, counteroffer if necessary to secure a deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $940,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to our final two rounds, and Bob is still not meeting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is my minimum and a significant amount of money.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired price, the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer and leaving me with nothing is too high.  

**Final Thoughts:**

While I'm disappointed I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, selling to John is the most sensible choice in this situation. It ensures I get a significant profit, and I can always explore other opportunities in the future."
