"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is considerably less than what I had in mind. Let's find a middle ground - how about $18,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $14,000. This would be a good deal for both of us - I get the product at a reasonable price, and you get a quick sale.",14000.0,Bob,4,
