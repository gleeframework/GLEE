Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a strategic offer. Here's why:

* **Above Minimum:**  $15,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, meaning you'll still profit if Bob accepts.
* **Testing the Waters:**  It's not too high, allowing for the possibility Bob might value the product more and be willing to pay a premium. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can always counter-offer closer to your minimum, potentially still getting a better price than John's $12,000.

This approach balances maximizing profit with the need to find out Bob's true valuation of the product."
