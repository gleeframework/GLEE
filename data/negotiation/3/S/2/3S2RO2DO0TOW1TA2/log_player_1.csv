Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try to find a compromise at $800,000? This is a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to his actual value, we're still not there. We need to push a little further and see if we can get a better deal.  We're still above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is still below what I had in mind, I understand your budget constraints.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we need to find a middle ground. While I appreciate your movement, I'm afraid $1,550,000 is still out of my reach. How about $950,000? I believe this demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase while reflecting a more realistic price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Bob is clearly getting closer to his true valuation, but we still have room to negotiate. It's important to remain firm and demonstrate that the product's value justifies a higher price. We are getting closer to John's offer, but we still have a few rounds to try and secure a better deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. I understand that finding the right price is important for both of us.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite a bit apart. I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his maximum valuation, but we're still significantly above that. We're also getting close to the point where continuing with Bob might not be worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer. We'll make one more strong counter-offer before considering John's offer."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I've tried to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial. This is my final offer - $1,150,000.  This price represents a significant concession on my part to get this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a final push to try and secure a deal with Bob. We are significantly lowering the price, but it is still a substantial amount above his stated limit. It's a calculated risk, as Bob might be willing to stretch his budget slightly if he believes this is his last chance to secure the product."
