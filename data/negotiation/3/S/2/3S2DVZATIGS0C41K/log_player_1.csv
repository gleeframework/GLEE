Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
