"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still willing to work with you. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
