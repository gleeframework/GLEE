Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($150) than your minimum selling price ($80). This allows you to aim higher.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:**  While you could aim for a price closer to $150, there's a risk Bob might reject it outright.  $120 represents a strong profit margin while still being appealing to Bob. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
