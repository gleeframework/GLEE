Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:**  This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. It leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good chance to get a high price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and casual, but also sets a clear price point. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a bit aggressive but gives me a strong starting point for the negotiation. By offering a higher price, I can gauge Bob's interest and hopefully leave room for negotiation if necessary. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then use his counteroffer to understand his perceived value of the product and adjust my own offer accordingly.  The ability to sell to John for $12,000 gives me a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm very interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to see if I can get a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate but also show that I'm not willing to sell for a price that's too far below what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to my minimum value.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've raised the offer slightly from Bob's $10,000 to $14,000.  This is still below my initial offer of $18,000 but it's closer to my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Message:**  I'm being firm but polite. I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but emphasizing that I need to get a price that's fair to me.  I'm also highlighting the potential benefit to Bob of getting a good deal on a product that's likely worth more than $14,000 to him. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but it also sets a clear lower limit on the price I'm willing to accept.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay the $14,000. If not, I'm still prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet your requested price. I am willing to pay up to $13000 for the product. Is this within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is above my minimum value of $12,000. While it's still a bit lower than I'd hoped for, it's a good deal, considering the potential risk of further negotiation and the option to sell to John for $12,000.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a profitable price, making it the most logical choice."
