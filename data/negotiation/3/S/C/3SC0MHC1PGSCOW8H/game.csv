"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  $10,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about $11,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  That's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
