"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price or to buy from John for a guaranteed $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can't go above $9,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to $8,000 or even lower.  It's possible that Alice might be willing to lower her price further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to keep the price under $9,000. How about we settle on $9,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still below my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle again, at $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product to be worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best price possible.  While $10,000 is tempting, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price. He might be able to convince Alice to go even lower, especially since he has the option of buying from John.  Additionally, there are still 5 rounds left, and Bob can continue to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.  I really want to work with you, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too far from my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you'll receive from this product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to seriously consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now firm on $10,000, and Bob's counteroffers are being rejected.  This indicates that further negotiation might not be fruitful, and Alice might be unwilling to budge further.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for $8,000.  While this is not the absolute lowest price, it's within Bob's budget and guarantees a purchase without further negotiation or risk of losing the product altogether."
