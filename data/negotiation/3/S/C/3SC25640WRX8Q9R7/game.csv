"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
