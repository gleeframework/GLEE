Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,400,000? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
