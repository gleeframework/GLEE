"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for both of us to close this deal. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me and offers a good compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
