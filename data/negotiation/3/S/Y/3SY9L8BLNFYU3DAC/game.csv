"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but I'm hoping to find a price that works a little better for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $975,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
