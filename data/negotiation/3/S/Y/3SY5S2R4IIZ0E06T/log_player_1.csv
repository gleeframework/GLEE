Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value of $1,500,000. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, keeping in mind John's offer as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to make more, accepting his offer guarantees me the desired $1,500,000.  Further negotiation carries the risk of rejection, potentially leaving me with only John's offer which is the same."
