Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  I always have the safety net of John's offer if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want. While $700,000 is a decent sum, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price. It's possible I can convince him to come up a bit, or at least get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his initial offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I've already rejected his previous offer and am not confident I can get a better price from him.  It's also worth noting that accepting this offer will be quicker and less hassle than negotiating further or selling to John."
