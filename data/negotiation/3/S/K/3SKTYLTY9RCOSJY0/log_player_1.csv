Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but higher than the value Bob places on it ($8,000). 
* This strategy is based on the idea of ""splitting the difference."" I'm hoping to get a price that is closer to my desired price while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to sell the product to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk."
