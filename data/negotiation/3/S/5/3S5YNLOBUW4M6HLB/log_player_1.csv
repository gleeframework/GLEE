"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. While I am open to negotiation, I cannot accept a price that low. I will counter with a new offer that is more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $130 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $140? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to secure a price that is closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $140 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $155.  This is a reasonable price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 155} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum requirements. Although $140 is close, it's still below my minimum value of $150.  Selling to John for $150 ensures I get the price I need and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in an even lower price."
