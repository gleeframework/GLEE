Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $18,500 is way above Bob's budget and he's already rejected several offers.  It's becoming clear that Alice isn't willing to come down to a price that Bob is comfortable with. 

With only three rounds left, the risk of not getting a deal with Alice is high.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price."
