"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the initial offer and providing your perspective. While $850,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to move closer to your price to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work. How about we agree on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking to my initial counter-offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to see more movement on the price to make this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's settle this right now. How about $925,000? This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer.  While $925,000 is still a bit above my budget, I'm willing to go to $900,000 to show my commitment to this deal. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,6,
