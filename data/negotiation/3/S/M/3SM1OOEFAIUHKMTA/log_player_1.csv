Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than John's offer, giving Bob an incentive to buy if the product is worth more to him than $1,500,000.  However, it's not so high that it's completely unreasonable and likely to be rejected out of hand. 

This approach balances the desire to maximize profit with the risk of losing the sale to John."
