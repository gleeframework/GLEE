"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Since Bob's maximum is $10,000, rejecting the offer allows him to try to get closer to that goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his $10,000 limit as possible. This offer is a significant discount from Alice's $12,000 price.  It's a bold move, but one that could potentially get Alice to move closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $10,000. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and possibly ending the negotiation entirely is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
