"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I know you'll find it highly valuable. My asking price is $1200000. This reflects the significant value it brings to your operations. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1000000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for us both to benefit from the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1000000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a fair price for both of us. This allows us to close the deal and unlock the benefits this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1050000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still allowing us to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1050000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1075000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in this product and allows us to finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
