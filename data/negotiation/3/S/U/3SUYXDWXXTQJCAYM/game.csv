"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $80.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price, and it would allow me to get the product from you.",100.0,Bob,4,
