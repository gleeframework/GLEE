"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,200,000? That's a significant price reduction and shows my willingness to work with you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $700,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $1,000,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can justify.  I'm willing to move to $750,000.  This represents a significant investment from my side and I believe it's a fair offer considering John is also offering the product.",750000.0,Bob,6,
