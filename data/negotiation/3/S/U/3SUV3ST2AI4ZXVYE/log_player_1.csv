Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low, I need to try and negotiate a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,200,000? That's a significant price reduction and shows my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I need.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer, but $700,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $1,000,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can justify.  I'm willing to move to $750,000.  This represents a significant investment from my side and I believe it's a fair offer considering John is also offering the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more from Bob, his offer is still far below what I need.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to continue negotiating. Selling to John ensures I get the best price possible."
