Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting high ($19,000) gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more willing to pay a higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer outright. However, it gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit. If Bob rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
