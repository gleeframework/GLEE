Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interests.  While I see the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would leave us both with a good profit margin. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
