"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is better than $1,200,000, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and try to lower the price further."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interests.  While I see the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This would leave us both with a good profit margin. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product to you is significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal range.  There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to push for a lower price, ideally closer to $1,050,000 or somewhere in between."
