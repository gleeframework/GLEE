{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product to Bob for $119, you maximize your potential profit while still ensuring Bob gets a perceived discount. If Bob rejects the offer, you can sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
