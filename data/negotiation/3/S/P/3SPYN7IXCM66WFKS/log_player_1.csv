"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it.  I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range where he might be willing to negotiate. This leaves room for potential compromise and allows me to see if he's interested at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for $100. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired amount. I'll continue negotiating with Bob. There's still potential for a better deal, and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
