"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a little. I'm offering you the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I respect that.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price slightly more, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair deal. I'm offering you the product for $11,250. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
