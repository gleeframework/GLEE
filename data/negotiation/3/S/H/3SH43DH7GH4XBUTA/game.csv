"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm offering the product for $1,075,000.  This represents a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
