Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a starting point. I'm aiming for a high price, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm leaving room to negotiate if Bob rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my target price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to what I'm looking for. I want to see if I can get closer to my target before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would be a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price and not that far off from what John is offering. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round. I want to maximize my profit and avoid losing too much money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.  Think carefully about this, as I'm confident you'll regret it if you let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my target price. With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is getting tense. While I could continue to try and negotiate with Bob, I'm concerned about running out of time and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a good profit and avoids any further risk of losing money during the negotiation process."
