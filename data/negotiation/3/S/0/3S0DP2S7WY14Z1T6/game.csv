"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,050,000? This would still represent a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $975,000? That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  I'm confident this is a good investment for you, and I'm willing to work with you to make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation. How about $985,000? That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",985000.0,Bob,6,
