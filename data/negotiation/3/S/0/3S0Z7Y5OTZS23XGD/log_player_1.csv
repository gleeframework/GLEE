Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is too low, and it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $875,000 is a decent compromise. It's more than John's offer, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield much higher."
