"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to pay right now. Would you consider $9500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $9500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11500 is still out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10000 for this product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer. If you're interested in finalizing the deal, let's make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to know you're serious about this product. I can offer you a price of $11000, which is my absolute lowest. If you're still interested, let's talk about the details.",11000.0,Alice,7,
