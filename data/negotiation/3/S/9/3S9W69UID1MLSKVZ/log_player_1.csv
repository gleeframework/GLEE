Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $12,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still earning a decent profit.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $11,800}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,800, which is $200 below its value to him. This should give me a decent profit while still being competitive. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
