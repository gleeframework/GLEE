"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is above his maximum budget, and he has a guaranteed alternative from John at $1,500,000. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Bob's first counteroffer is $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $2,000,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This aggressive counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a compromise quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob's counteroffer is $1,250,000. This is a compromise between his previous offer of $1,000,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,750,000. He's showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping his maximum budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, the risk of further negotiation is not worth it.  It's more efficient to accept John's guaranteed offer and save the money."
