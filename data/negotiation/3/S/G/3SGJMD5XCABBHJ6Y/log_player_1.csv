I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still secure a price above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  It also signals to Bob that I value the product highly and am serious about getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still remaining above my minimum acceptable value. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to give away the product for a drastically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but still a price I'm comfortable with. It shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but also that I'm not willing to go much lower."
