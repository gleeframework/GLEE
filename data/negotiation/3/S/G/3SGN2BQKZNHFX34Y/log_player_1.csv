Round 6
Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing commitment to the purchase, his offer increases are relatively small.  At this stage, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I can secure with John. It makes the most business sense to cut negotiations with Bob short and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
