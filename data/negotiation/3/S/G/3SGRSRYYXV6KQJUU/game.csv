"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1250000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about $1175000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
