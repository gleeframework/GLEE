"I understand that you're looking to save a bit on the price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. Let's meet in the middle at $1250000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really trying to drive the price down, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I'm not going to go below $1220000. Let's aim for $1200000 as a target, but I'll give you a slight discount for being a serious buyer. How about $1220000?",1220000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1220000 is still above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1220000, which would be $1210000. Can we discuss this price?",1210000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to squeeze every last penny out of this deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1210000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet exactly in the middle at $1210000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",1210000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not convinced that the price is right. I'm willing to meet you at $1190000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1190000.0,Bob,8,
