{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? That gives us both some room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,220,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can do better.  I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I can't go any lower than $1,230,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal and close this out."", ""product_price"": 1230000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation.  I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me my minimum and prevents further haggling."
