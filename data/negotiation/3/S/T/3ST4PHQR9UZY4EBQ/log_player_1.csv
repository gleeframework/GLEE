Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Given its potential, I'm certain this is a competitive offer. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows John will buy the product for $1,500,000, so she starts high to maximize potential profit.
* **Slight negotiation room:**  Offering it at $1,450,000 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, which might make him feel more in control of the deal.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob's specific situation, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Politeness and openness:**  Alice maintains a polite and open tone, encouraging further discussion and increasing the chance of a successful sale. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Alice's knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, she might adjust her approach."
