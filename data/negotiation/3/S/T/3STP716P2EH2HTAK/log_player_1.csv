Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below the $1,000,000 mark.  At this point, the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John. It's time to cut bait with Bob and secure the sure thing."
