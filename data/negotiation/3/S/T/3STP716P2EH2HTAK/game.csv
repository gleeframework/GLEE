"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,200,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your interest and to demonstrate my willingness to make a deal, I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,6,
