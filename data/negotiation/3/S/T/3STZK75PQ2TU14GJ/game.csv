"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from $140. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to pay that amount.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $130? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it. It's the highest I can go, though!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go to $130. I think $125 is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'm sticking with my previous offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
