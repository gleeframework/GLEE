Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth millions down the line. I'm willing to offer it to you first for $1,800,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, I can afford to be ambitious with my initial offer to Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's potential future value, potentially justifying a price much higher than its immediate worth to Bob. 
* **First Mover Advantage:** Offering it to Bob first at this premium price creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency.  

**Important Note:** This strategy is risky.  There's a chance Bob will be turned off by the high price and reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a significantly higher price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
