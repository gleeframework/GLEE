Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $200 sets a high initial price, giving us room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  The message emphasizes openness to discussion, making Bob feel like he has a chance to influence the price.
* **Asking for Opinion:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This approach allows us to gauge Bob's interest while still protecting our minimum value of $150. We can then adjust our strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to discussion. Based on my budget, I am willing to offer $175 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $175 is above our minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer secures a sale and guarantees a profit. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or we'll waste time in back-and-forth negotiations.  Selling to Bob at this price is the most efficient and profitable choice."
