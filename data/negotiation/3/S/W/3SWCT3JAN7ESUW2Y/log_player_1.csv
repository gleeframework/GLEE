Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures a profit close to the maximum.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and not overthink the offer."
