You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since you are willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You're guaranteed to get the product at your maximum price."
