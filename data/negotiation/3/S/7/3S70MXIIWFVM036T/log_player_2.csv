"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and it allows me to make a substantial profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** While Alice's offer is higher than her product's value to her, it's still lower than what Bob would pay John. 
* **Bob saves money.** By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $100,000 compared to buying from John."
