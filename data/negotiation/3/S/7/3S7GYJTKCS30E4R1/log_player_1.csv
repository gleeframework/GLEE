Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a good profit, but you also want to keep the negotiation going. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still feeling like he's getting a good deal.

By starting with this offer, you encourage Bob to counter-offer, potentially driving the price up further. However, you are always prepared to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counter-offer:**  You can try to get closer to your ideal price by making a counter-offer.
* **Test Bob's limits:** By rejecting his offer, you see if he's willing to increase his bid.

Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and allows you to get a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** You're not being stubborn, but you're not giving in either.
* **Is closer to your desired price:** $10,500 is a significant step towards your desired profit.
* **Is still attractive to Bob:** It's a reasonable compromise, especially considering the value of the product to him.

This approach aims to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while keeping you within your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is still a bit lower than your ideal price, it's significantly higher than selling to John and still a good profit for you.  

It's important to remember that:

* **Negotiations involve compromises:** Bob has shown his maximum price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing the negotiation could take longer, and John might not be available indefinitely.
* **$10,000 is a solid gain:**  You are still earning $2,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a good financial outcome."
