"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to create room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, hoping to make the offer more appealing.
* **Room for negotiation:** $18,000 is a starting point. I'm open to negotiating within a reasonable range. 
* **Time pressure:**  I'm aware of the limited rounds, so I want to get things moving quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This gives you a great deal, and it's fair to me. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm emphasizing that the price is still a great deal for Bob. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal, reminding Bob that we have limited rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given it some thought and would like to propose $14,000 as a compromise. I believe this offers a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to accept his offer, as it's the best deal I'm likely to get with only 6 rounds remaining.  I'm also taking into account the risk that if I reject his offer, he may not make another counteroffer, and I'd be forced to sell to John for $15,000."
