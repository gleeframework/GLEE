Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $17,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but that price is still a bit high for me. I could do $13,000.  That's a very competitive offer considering John is willing to sell a similar product for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is getting closer to our acceptable range:**  While $13,000 is below our ideal, it's a reasonable profit. 
* **Competition:** Bob mentioning a competitor at $8,000 might be a bluff, but it introduces uncertainty. We don't want to risk him walking away for a potentially non-existent deal.
* **Time:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations. Continuing to push for a significantly higher price might frustrate Bob and lead to him leaving the negotiation.

It's better to take a good offer now than risk ending up with nothing or a lower offer later."
