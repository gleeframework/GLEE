Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it for that price guarantees a sale but leaves money on the table.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** A price of $1,150,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still earning you a substantial profit above your minimum.
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're confident John will indeed buy the product for $1,200,000 if Bob declines. 
* Depending on the nature of the product and your relationship with Bob, there might be room for negotiation."
