"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range.  I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly but still keeping it above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm making a significant concession by lowering the price to $115.  This is getting closer to Bob's perceived value of the product.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept the offer, as I'm running out of time.  If he rejects, I'm getting closer to my decision point of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'm hoping Bob will increase his offer slightly in the next round. If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John, as time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm making a final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. I'm lowering the price to $110, which is only slightly above my minimum. If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob. I'm close to my minimum value, but I'm also running out of time. I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John and sell the product to him."
