"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. Let me know your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise, I think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
