"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000). As Bob, I aim to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,375,000, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the discount I'm offering you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is a good deal for me. It's lower than my last counteroffer, and I'm getting a significant discount from the product's worth to Alice. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice backing out or the negotiations dragging on.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking losing it altogether."
