Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
