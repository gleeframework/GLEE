Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $700,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $675,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small premium for the product's value. How about $680,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's shown some movement, $680,000 is still too low for me. I'm not in a rush and want to secure the best possible price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $680,000 is still too far below the true value of this product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $720,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $680,000 and $720,000, which would be $700,000. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. How about $695,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While he's shown a willingness to compromise, $695,000 is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to hold out for a higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $800,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but he's still not getting close to the value I believe the product has.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to take the sure thing and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
