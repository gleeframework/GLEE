"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. To start, I'm willing to sell it for $750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $675,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",675000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $675,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $700,000. This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $700,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $675,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small premium for the product's value. How about $680,000?",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $680,000 is still too far below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $700,000. How about $720,000? This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this potentially valuable partnership.",720000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $720,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $680,000 and $720,000, which would be $700,000. However, I'm willing to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. How about $695,000?",695000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $695,000 is still not a price I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, which would be $707,500. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a final agreement.",707500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $695,000. I'm willing to go up to $705,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product, while also being mindful of my budget. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",705000.0,Bob,8,
