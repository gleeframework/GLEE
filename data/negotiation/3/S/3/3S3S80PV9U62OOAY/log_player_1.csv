Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy involved:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be a real asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,500. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $14,500 represents a markup of just over 20%. While this is a significant increase, it's not so high as to be immediately off-putting to Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message implies there might be some flexibility, encouraging Bob to engage in a conversation even if he finds the initial price a bit high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might lower the initial offer slightly. 
* **The Product's Uniqueness:** If the product is highly specialized and in demand, a higher markup might be justified.

This initial offer aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving you room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a deal above your minimum acceptable price."
