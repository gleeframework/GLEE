Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This feels like a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above our $800,000 minimum.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while not appearing overly aggressive. This approach might make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob could reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk and potential reward by aiming for a high price without being unrealistic."
