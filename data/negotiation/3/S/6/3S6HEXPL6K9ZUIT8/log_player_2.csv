"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $15,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to me, and I'm willing to negotiate to make it work for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's clear you need to negotiate or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially get a great deal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the price feels too high, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a lower price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above your $8,000 maximum and John's offer. There's room for Alice to come down further, so it's worth negotiating at least one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me partway, Alice. How about we try $7,500?  That feels more reasonable to me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This offer is still below my maximum, but closer to Alice's last offer, showing I'm willing to move. 
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm stating a specific price without too much fluff, keeping the negotiation focused.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $9,500? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your acceptable price range, but $9,500 is still a significant amount over your $8,000 limit.  You're likely better off getting the product from John at this point. One more counteroffer could create risk without enough potential reward to justify it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $9,500 is still more than I'm able to spend. My absolute best offer is $7,800.  If you can't do that, I'll unfortunately need to pass this time."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final attempt to get a deal with Alice. It's just below my $8,000 maximum, leaving a tiny bit of room to make Alice feel like she got a small concession.
* **Clear and Firm:** I'm being clear that this is my best offer and I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't accept.
* **Polite but Direct:** I'm maintaining a polite tone, but I'm not leaving any ambiguity about my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,800. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $9,000, which is still above your $8,000 limit. It's unlikely she'll come down further, and you've already reached your ""walk-away"" point.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $8,000 price."
