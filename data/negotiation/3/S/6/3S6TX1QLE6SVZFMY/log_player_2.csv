Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,800. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $9,800.  It's not worth the further negotiation and risk of her not budging to save $200, especially when you have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000."
