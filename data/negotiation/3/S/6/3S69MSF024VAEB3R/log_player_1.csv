Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $125 allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and we can still decrease the price while staying above our minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose out. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring a guaranteed sale at our minimum acceptable price."
