"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,800. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,800 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I've already discounted the price significantly, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $12,400, which is just $400 more than your offer. This is the best I can do. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",12400.0,Alice,5,
