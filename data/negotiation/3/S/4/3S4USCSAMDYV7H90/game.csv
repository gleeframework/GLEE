"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming back to me. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $11,500. Can you meet me at that price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from.  $11,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm still interested in making this work. How about we settle on $12,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a final offer of $12,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",12000.0,Bob,6,
