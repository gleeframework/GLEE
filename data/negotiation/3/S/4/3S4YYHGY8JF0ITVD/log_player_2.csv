"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing to a price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room to save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, and will hopefully force Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$1,150,000 is still too high. I'll counter again, but will try to narrow the gap a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still holding firm on getting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,125,000 is closer to my target, I believe we can still do better.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer slightly higher than my previous one, hoping Alice will meet me in the middle. If she doesn't, I'll likely go with John to avoid further haggling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, I'm starting to run out of time. $1,120,000 is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of losing the deal with Alice or being forced to pay John's higher price."
