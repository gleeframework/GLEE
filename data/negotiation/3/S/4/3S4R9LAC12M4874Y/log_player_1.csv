Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, potentially reaching a lower price, or having the deal fall through entirely."
