Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Dear Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile at a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 (John's offer) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying significantly above his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob without revealing our minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to secure a sale price that surpasses John's offer while still being enticing enough for Bob to accept."
