Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers and a unique chance for you to acquire it before it's made available elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below his perceived value allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing your profit further. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $800,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, which strengthens your position.

**Important:** This is a starting point. Observe Bob's reaction and be prepared to adjust your approach in a potential negotiation."
