Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product and the importance of maintaining a fair transaction, I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we aim for a price of $135? This still allows us to cover the costs and maintain a reasonable profit, while staying within your budget considerations.
