"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm looking for $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that $900000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I've done my research and I believe the product's value is more in line with $950000. I'm willing to pay that amount, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. It's still a great deal, and I believe it's worth considering. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach your target price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $1025000 is as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1002500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to reach your target price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I think it's the absolute maximum I can afford. I'd like to propose a final price of $1000000.",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're at your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $1050000. It's a final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
