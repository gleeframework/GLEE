"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
