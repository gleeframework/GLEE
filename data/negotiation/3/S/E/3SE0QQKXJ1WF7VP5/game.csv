"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 for this product.  I believe that still reflects a fair deal considering its potential. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
