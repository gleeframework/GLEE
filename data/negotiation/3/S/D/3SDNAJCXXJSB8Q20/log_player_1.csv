Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However,  $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
