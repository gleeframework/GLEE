"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing further details.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  How about we start with something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000.  This takes into account its value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to a price that might work for both of us.  However,  $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial offer, and I'm hopeful we can make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming up on the price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's significant value while recognizing your willingness to negotiate.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm glad to see we're making progress.  How about we settle at $750,000?  I think that's a very fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution. However,  $750,000 is still below the product's true market value. I'm ready to make this work, so I'm proposing a final offer of $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,7,
