"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing further details."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high initial offer is a common negotiation tactic. 

* **Anchoring:** This sets a high anchor point for the negotiation. Even though it's significantly above both Bob's valuation and John's offer, it frames the product as high-value from the start.
* **Room for Negotiation:** It allows for concessions later in the negotiation, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal as the price decreases. 
* **Testing the Waters:** It helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium for the product. 

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  How about we start with something closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our valuation and John's standing offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While we want to secure a deal with Bob if possible, we have time to negotiate a better price.  We'll counter with a price closer to our target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000.  This takes into account its value while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We've significantly lowered our price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Valuation:** The new price is still comfortably above both Bob's perceived value and John's offer, ensuring we're aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Justification:** We're reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price, even with the concession. 

We'll continue adjusting our strategy based on Bob's response, aiming to close the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to a price that might work for both of us.  However,  $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial offer, and I'm hopeful we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly lower than our $1,000,000 minimum and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate and several rounds left. We'll continue aiming higher, but with smaller adjustments to signal we are getting closer to our bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming up on the price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's significant value while recognizing your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this time ($150,000 down from $1,200,000), indicating we are nearing our limit. 
* **Holding Strong:** The new price is still comfortably above both Bob's valuation and John's offer, reinforcing the product's worth.
* **Positive Language:** We're maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.

We are getting closer to a potential deal, but we are still prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet our minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm glad to see we're making progress.  How about we settle at $750,000?  I think that's a very fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below our $1,000,000 threshold.  We are willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss. We have a backup offer from John that guarantees our minimum price, giving us leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution. However,  $750,000 is still below the product's true market value. I'm ready to make this work, so I'm proposing a final offer of $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're explicitly stating this is our final offer, creating a sense of urgency and signaling our bottom line.
* **Significant Concession:**  We've dropped the price substantially to $975,000, showing our commitment to closing the deal.
* **Just Above Minimum:**  The price is now just above our $1,000,000 minimum (considering we likely won't get another offer this close).
* **Justification:** We're still emphasizing the fairness of the deal and the product's value, even with the significant discount.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing our potential profit. If he rejects this offer, we will likely proceed with selling to John."
