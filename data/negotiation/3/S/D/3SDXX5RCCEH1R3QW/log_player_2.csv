Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000.  This takes into account its value while acknowledging your initial offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution. However,  $750,000 is still below the product's true market value. I'm ready to make this work, so I'm proposing a final offer of $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John for $800,000.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to go substantially lower:** Alice has labeled her $975,000 offer as ""final,"" implying she won't budge much.  
* **You're running out of rounds:** With only a few rounds left, you risk Alice sticking close to her price and running out of time to negotiate a better deal.
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** Buying from John guarantees you stay within your $800,000 budget.

While you could try to push Alice a bit further, the risk of missing out on a good deal with John outweighs the potential savings."
