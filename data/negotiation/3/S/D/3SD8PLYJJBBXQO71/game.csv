"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  I'm confident this price still represents a good deal for you and allows me to make this acquisition work for my needs.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you while also being a fair compromise for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
