"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, you have some leeway to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you while also being a fair compromise for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good deal for me, saving me $150,000 compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Alice would accept a lower offer.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or potentially being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
