{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, and it allows me to gauge his interest level and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining my bottom line:** This price is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal. 
* **Leaving the option open to John:** I'm not overly aggressive, which keeps John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a good compromise considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my bottom line, it's not enough to meet my minimum requirement. 
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price that's more favorable to me. 
* **John remains a viable option.** This strategy keeps John as a backup if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, and it's closer to your initial offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a concession, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a higher price:**  $950,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlight fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair deal for both of us"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  The counteroffer isn't too low, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again, potentially pushing the price higher.
* **John is a strong backup:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, selling to John remains a viable option.

I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm determined to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $930,000, but that's as low as I can go.  This price is still significantly more than your initial offer, and it's very close to my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is close to my minimum acceptable price, signaling that I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Compromise:** I'm still making a small concession, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the value of the price compared to Bob's initial offer reinforces my position.
* **Setting a deadline:**  By stating this is my ""lowest possible price,"" I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely move on to John, as my minimum acceptable price has almost been reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $930,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Negotiation has stalled.**  There's no indication that Bob will budge further.
* **John is a better option.** Selling to John guarantees me a significantly higher price that meets my minimum requirements.

While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, it's in my best interest to take the sure thing with John at this point."
