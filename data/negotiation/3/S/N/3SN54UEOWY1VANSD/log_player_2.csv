Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!

While $110 is better than $120, you're still looking to save as much as possible. Let's try another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $100? That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice has come down to $105, which is within your budget and a good deal considering your goal of saving money. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking another counteroffer that might be rejected or going with John's more expensive option."
