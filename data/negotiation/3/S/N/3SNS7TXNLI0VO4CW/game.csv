"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $810,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $810,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about $780,000?  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset, and I'm eager to make this deal work.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $795,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
