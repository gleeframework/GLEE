"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,
