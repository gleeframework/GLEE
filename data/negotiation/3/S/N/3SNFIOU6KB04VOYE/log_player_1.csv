This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?  I believe that's a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, and accepting it would mean a significant loss for me. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I understand your perspective, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about $9,000? This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $6,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm not ready to settle for this price yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually acceptable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,500 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
