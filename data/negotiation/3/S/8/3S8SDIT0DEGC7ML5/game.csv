"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also acknowledging the value you place on the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think I deserve a better price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
