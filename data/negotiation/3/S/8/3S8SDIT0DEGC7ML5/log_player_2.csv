"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is still above my desired price range.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer, aiming to push Alice to negotiate more seriously.
