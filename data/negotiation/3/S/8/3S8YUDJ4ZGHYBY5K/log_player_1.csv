**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's anchored to a price well below our minimum. We're at round 6, and the increments are small.  It's unlikely he'll significantly bridge the gap to $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed sale at our desired price, making it the most logical decision at this point."
