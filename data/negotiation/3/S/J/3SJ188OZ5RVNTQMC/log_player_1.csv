Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  I'm asking $11,500 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $11,500 gives me a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I've highlighted the product's value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for a back-and-forth. I'm prepared to negotiate, but I want to show I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my ideal:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not as profitable as I'd like.
* **Negotiation is key:**  I believe I can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and has already moved closer to my asking price.
* **Avoiding the John alternative:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be the absolute minimum, and I'm hoping for a better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to come down a bit,  $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like to accept. How about we split the difference at $11,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging further dialogue.
* **Leaving room for final negotiation:** I'm still open to a bit of give and take, but I'm not willing to go lower than $11,000."
