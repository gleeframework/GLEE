Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?  This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close this deal quickly.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750

$9,750 is a fair price. It's close enough to my target, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome."
