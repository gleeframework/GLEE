Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is a good price and it's getting closer to my desired price.  It's worth taking this deal rather than risking further negotiation and possibly having to settle for John's lower offer."
