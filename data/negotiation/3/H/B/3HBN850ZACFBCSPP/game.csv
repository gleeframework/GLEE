"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fairer price. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from $140. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
