{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $87?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $87. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $95,  it's a good price and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob.  Selling to John for $80 is only $3 less, and I'd rather avoid the hassle of finding another buyer."
