"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $12000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $15000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",15000.0,Bob,4,
