Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $85, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. It's a great deal for you, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, it's clear she's unlikely to go much lower than $85. I have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John.  It makes more sense to take the sure thing and save the extra $5."
