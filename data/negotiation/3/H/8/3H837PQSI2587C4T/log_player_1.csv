"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $162. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $162 is a good price and higher than selling to John. It's also likely that Bob won't go higher, so I'm happy to take this deal."
