"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of significant value to you.  I'm asking for $9,000, but am open to discussing the price further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer of $9,000 is only slightly below your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
