Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of significant value to you.  I'm asking for $9,000, but am open to discussing the price further."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Negotiation Room:**  Starting with $9,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strong but Flexible:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value while expressing a willingness to be flexible.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a much higher profit compared to immediately selling to John."
