"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which still leaves you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves me with a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1280000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm prepared to pay $1,225,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,225,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm proposing a price of $1,260,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1260000.0,Alice,5,
