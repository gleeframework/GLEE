"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the maximum value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $9,000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. It's a bit higher than your maximum, but I'm willing to compromise to find a deal. Let's see if we can shake hands on this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm firm on my offer of $9,000. It's a fair price considering both our needs. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $11,000. Let's try to find a deal",11000.0,Alice,7,
