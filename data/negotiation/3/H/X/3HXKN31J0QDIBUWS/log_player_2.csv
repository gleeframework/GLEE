"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  You're aiming for a price closer to $100, and you know Alice is willing to sell for that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counter-offer is closer to your desired price, you still have room to negotiate.  You're aiming for a price below $110, and you know Alice is willing to sell for less than $112.50.  Another counter-offer will likely get you closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $108.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm aiming for."", ""product_price"": 108}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I can do $109.50, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109.50 is very close to your desired price range.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counter-offer and you'll end up paying John's price of $120.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still a good deal for you."
