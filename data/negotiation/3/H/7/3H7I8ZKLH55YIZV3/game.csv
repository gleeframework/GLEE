"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $17000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $14000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $14000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15500 is the lowest I can go.  This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still interested in the product, but $15500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $15250?  That's the absolute most I can afford, and it's a great deal for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
