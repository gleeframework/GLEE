Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  The value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1500000. This price reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
