"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a steal considering its value!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you say?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is closer to your offer. It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $80? That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
