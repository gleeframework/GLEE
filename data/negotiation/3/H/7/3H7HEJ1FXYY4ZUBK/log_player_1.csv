Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives Bob room to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a ridiculously low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer was low, he clearly wants the product. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm offering $13,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to maintain a good rapport.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** This counteroffer still gives Bob some wiggle room if he's willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $12,500 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is stalled:** Bob has come up to $12,500, and it's likely he won't go any higher. Further negotiation might just waste time.
* **John is a reliable option:**  I know I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk by accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  It's possible that John could change his mind or find a better deal elsewhere. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and ensures some profit."
