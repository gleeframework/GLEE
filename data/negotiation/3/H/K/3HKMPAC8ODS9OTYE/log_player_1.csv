"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully start the negotiation on a positive note. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to me to make it seem like a good deal for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to try and secure a price as close to my minimum ($15,000) as possible. By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects the offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, but I can likely get a better price.  
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 9 rounds left, giving me ample time to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my target while still being within a range that Bob might consider. I'll likely start with a price around $12,000, as this is closer to Bob's perceived value and leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer.  This shows a willingness to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to sell at a major loss.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to me, subtly implying that $12,000 is a good deal for him.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm using language that emphasizes a collaborative approach, hoping to encourage Bob to find a compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move up. 
* **Building to a Compromise:**  With each round, I'll gradually adjust my offer based on Bob's responses, aiming for a price that's acceptable to both of us. 
* **Keeping the Option Open:** I'm still aware of the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
