"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I can do $125, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really like the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
