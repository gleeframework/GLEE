"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $13,000 feels fair. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite significant, and $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Could we perhaps meet in the middle, say around $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product has value, but I still think $9,500 is a fair price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer. To be honest, $9,500 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? This ensures a fair deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be respectful of your budget. However, I can't go as low as $9,000. My final offer is $10,000.  Take it or leave it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
