"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. I believe you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I agree it's a great product, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about we settle at $675,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $675,000 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised by moving from $800,000 to $750,000, and I'm not willing to give up much more. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new offer of $725,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
