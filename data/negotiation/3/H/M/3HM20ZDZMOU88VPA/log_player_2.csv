"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. I should try to negotiate a lower price, closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Respectful Tone:** While my counteroffer is aggressive, I'm keeping the tone polite and respectful to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Goal in Mind:** My ultimate goal is to get the product as close to John's $8,000 price as possible. By starting low, I'm aiming to meet Alice somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still higher than John's price.  I'll try to meet in the middle with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between her last offer ($8,500) and my previous counteroffer ($7,000). 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  This approach shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Near John's Price:** While $7,750 is still slightly above John's offer, it's close enough that I might consider accepting if Alice rejects this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your last offer. Let me know if you're open to this compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk. John's offer of $8,000 is a guaranteed saving, and the difference of $250 is not significant enough to justify the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
