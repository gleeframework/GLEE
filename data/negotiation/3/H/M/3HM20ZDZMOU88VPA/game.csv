"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your last offer. Let me know if you're open to this compromise.",8250.0,Alice,5,
