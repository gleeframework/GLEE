"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've presented,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, taking into account its potential and the special package you've offered. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. This still includes the special package deal and reflects the value of the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward together.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit out of reach. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,150,000. This price acknowledges the product's value and the special package, while ensuring a profitable deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
