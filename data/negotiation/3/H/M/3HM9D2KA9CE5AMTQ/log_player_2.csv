Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've presented,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows.

```

* **Sets a Clear Anchor:** This counteroffer establishes a starting point for negotiations."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, to ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. This still includes the special package deal and reflects the value of the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward together.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit out of reach. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $1,150,000. This price acknowledges the product's value and the special package, while ensuring a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Change:** This counteroffer is a modest increase from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is very close to my desired price point and significantly lower than John's offer. 
* **Potential for Partnership:** Alice's message emphasizes the potential for a ""successful partnership,"" implying a willingness to build a long-term relationship. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating. It's more likely that Alice won't budge further, and I might end up paying more or losing the deal.

By accepting this offer, I secure the product at a good price and potentially establish a positive relationship with Alice for future transactions."
