"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1650000. I'm thinking of a price of $1675000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
