Round 2

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position,  the value of this product is significant.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,750?"", ""product_price"": 10750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,750, which would be $10,125. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $9,500 and moving slowly. Taking the $10,125 is a good deal and avoids the risk of him dropping his offer further or the negotiation failing."
