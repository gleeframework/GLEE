"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob away. I want to see his reaction and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I still have 9 rounds to try and get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $150 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $175?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more than $160.  While I could sell to John for $150 right now, I have 6 rounds remaining to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $165.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to hold out for a little more, I'm starting to run out of time. It's better to accept Bob's offer of $155 now than risk losing him completely and having to settle for $150 with John."
