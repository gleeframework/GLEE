"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me. This is a good starting point to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also adding a message to make the offer more personable and inviting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that this is my lowest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. However, I still think we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 97.50}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us, and that it allows us to reach an agreement. This should hopefully encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I value your product, but I would like to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $88 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to sell to John for $100 and guarantee a profit."
