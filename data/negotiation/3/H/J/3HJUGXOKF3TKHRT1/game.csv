"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I'm starting the negotiation at $105, as I'm confident in its value and would like to make it an attractive offer for you.",105.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $105 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between the value we both see in the product and the budget you've mentioned.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you think?",92.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I propose a price of $93 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.",93.0,Alice,5,
