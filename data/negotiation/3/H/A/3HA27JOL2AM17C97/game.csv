"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $108. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $107.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford right now.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $107 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $109. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
