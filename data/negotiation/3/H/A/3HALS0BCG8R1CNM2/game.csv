"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very competitive price.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll sell it to you for $10,000.  This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a price that's fair for both of us. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,
