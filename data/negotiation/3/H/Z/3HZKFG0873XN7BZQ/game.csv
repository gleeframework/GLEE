"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110?  That's still a good price for this fantastic product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could you possibly meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I value your interest, $90 is still a little below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I'm glad we could reach a compromise. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I hope this works for you.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $95 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm open to one final offer before I have to consider other options. Would you be willing to go up to $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",105.0,Alice,7,
