"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than his initial offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $90? It's a fair compromise that would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $80. How about $82.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5

While $82.5 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to close the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $82.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about $87.50? That's closer to your offer and allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above $80, and I'm not comfortable with $87.50. How about $85? That's the middle ground between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round. It's possible that we can still reach an agreement closer to my desired price, and I don't want to lose out on that opportunity."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $88? This would be a fair compromise and would help us close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go any higher than $85, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $88, so how about $84? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $100. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob, I'm still able to secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements. I've already lost several rounds with Bob, and there's a risk that we'll continue to go back and forth without reaching an agreement.  It's important to remember that there's always a chance for negotiation, but sometimes it's better to move on and explore other opportunities."
