"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $850,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
