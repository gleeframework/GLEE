"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $8,750?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,250? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,
