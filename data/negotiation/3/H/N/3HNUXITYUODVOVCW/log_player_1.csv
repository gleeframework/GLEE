Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible while ensuring he accepts the deal. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell to John for $800,000, but aiming higher with Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still netting you a significant profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high potential profit and a realistic chance of Bob accepting the offer."
