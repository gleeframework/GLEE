"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,500?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, and if not, he can always purchase from John for $10,000.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250 as a compromise.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The deal is getting closer:**  $11,250 is only $250 more than Bob's counteroffer, and significantly less than Alice's original asking price.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers, especially as Alice is demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Alternative option:** Bob can always buy from John, but the potential savings by accepting this offer are significant.

While Bob could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal altogether is higher. This offer represents a good compromise that allows Bob to buy the product at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
