"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,500?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250 as a compromise.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal now.",11250.0,Alice,5,
