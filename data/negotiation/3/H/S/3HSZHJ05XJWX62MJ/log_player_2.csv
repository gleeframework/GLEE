"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $80 to you, as you've indicated it's valued at $150 to you personally. Considering this, I'd like to propose an offer of $120 for the product. This price reflects both the product's worth and our desire to make a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is significantly above her value for the product, indicating room for negotiation. While buying from John is a last resort at $150, rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a better counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
