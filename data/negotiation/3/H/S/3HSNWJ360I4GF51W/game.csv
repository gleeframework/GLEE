"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I can't go as low as $7,500, but I'm prepared to offer the product for $8,200. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
