{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential for you. Please let me know your thoughts, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, her goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a sense of urgency (other interested parties) and positions the price as a potential bargain compared to its true value to Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still landing Alice a higher profit margin than her guaranteed sale to John."
