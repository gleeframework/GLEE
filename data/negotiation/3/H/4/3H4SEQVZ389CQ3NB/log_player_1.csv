"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to my desired profit margin, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be interested in paying this amount, given that the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $90, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  This still leaves me with a decent profit, and hopefully encourages him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $82.5 is only slightly lower than selling to John for $80.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and I've already had several rounds of negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
