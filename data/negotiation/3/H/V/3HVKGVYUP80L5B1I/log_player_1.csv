Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves a potential $75,000 margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal if he negotiates. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial price.
* **Balancing Profit with Risk:** Offering it at $925,000 aims for a significant profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000."
