"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your target price of $1,200,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better deal.  There are 9 more rounds, so there's plenty of time to work towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  While it's a risky move, it signals Bob's serious intent to negotiate and sets a strong starting point. 
* **Justification:** The message explains the reasoning behind the counteroffer, highlighting the value to Alice and Bob's budget limitations. This adds a layer of professionalism and helps establish a potential foundation for compromise. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving some room for negotiation (between $750,000 and Bob's $1,200,000 limit) creates an opportunity for both parties to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's target price, $850,000 is still above his $1,200,000 limit. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially achieve a better price.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John at $1,200,000 would be a last resort, especially since there's a good chance of getting a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to go a little higher. However, $850,000 is still a bit too much for my budget. I'm offering $800,000. This price is reasonable, as it's just above your valuation and would leave us both satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** Bob raises his offer slightly, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, he remains below his maximum limit and still aims for a deal that's favorable to him.
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes the compromise by suggesting the price is ""just above"" Alice's valuation, hinting at a potential meeting point.
* **Mutual Benefit:** The focus on mutual satisfaction suggests that Bob wants to achieve a win-win scenario, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting the offer."
