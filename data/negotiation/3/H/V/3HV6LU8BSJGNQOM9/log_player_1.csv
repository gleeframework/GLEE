Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price from John, I want to start by aiming higher. There's a chance Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down.  Even if he negotiates, there's a good chance I can secure a price higher than $10,000.
* **Confident Presentation:**  My message emphasizes the product's value without revealing my bottom line. This approach aims to pique Bob's interest and encourage a positive response."
