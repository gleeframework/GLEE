"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $150. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $150. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
