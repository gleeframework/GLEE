"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity.  However, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to purchase it for $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  ",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $500, which will bring the total value to $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",10550.0,Alice,5,
