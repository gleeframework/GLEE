``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) but still below what it's worth to Bob ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and increases my chances of securing a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is a decent price, it's still lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

While $7,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell below $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to push for that price."
