"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial ask. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000?  I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product while still being amenable to your budget.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $975,000. This price allows me to secure the product without exceeding my financial limits.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still quite a way off from what I consider a fair price.  This product offers significant long-term value that goes beyond the current market conditions.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this presents a win-win scenario for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close, but we're still not quite there. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to be firm on my end.  I can do $995,000, and that's my absolute bottom line. This offer is more than fair considering the potential ROI this product offers you.",995000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $990,000. This price allows us to reach an agreement that respects both our financial positions.",990000.0,Bob,8,
