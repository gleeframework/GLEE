Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price you're both happy with.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
