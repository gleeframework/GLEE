"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer ($1,150,000) that's closer to our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) than Bob's valuation ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""careful consideration"" and ""fair price,"" we aim to frame the offer as well-reasoned, not arbitrary.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone remains positive and collaborative, encouraging Bob to engage in a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting $900,000 would be a substantial loss. We know John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, making Bob's current offer unattractive.  We'll proceed to the next round and present a counter-offer to keep the negotiation with Bob alive for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, your offer is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be realistic, the product's value is much closer to my original asking price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** We're making a significant move towards Bob's offer to demonstrate our willingness to negotiate, but we're still anchoring the price closer to our target.
* **Justification:**  We're subtly reminding Bob that our initial price was carefully considered by highlighting the product's inherent value.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""meet halfway"" encourages a sense of collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $975,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer slightly, but it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price and his ""final offer"" statement could be a negotiating tactic.
* **Time Value:**  We are losing potential profit with each round that keeps us below $1,200,000. John's standing offer is becoming more appealing. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We need to show Bob that we're serious about our valuation. Accepting this offer might signal desperation. 

We'll reject this offer to signal that we're willing to walk away unless Bob makes a substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $975,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  Frankly, I'm prepared to walk away and pursue other options if we can't agree on a price closer to $1,100,000. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This offer stands until the end of the next round."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're drawing a line in the sand, clearly stating that Bob's offer is unacceptable and we're prepared to walk away. However, we're still offering a price that's a significant concession from our initial ask.
* **Time Pressure:** By introducing a deadline, we're adding a sense of urgency and pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob that we have a backup plan (John), but we're still prioritizing a deal with him.
* **Final Offer:**  While we're not explicitly saying it, the tone and structure of this counter-offer strongly suggest this is our final significant move. This puts the ball firmly in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,075,000, which would be $1,025,000. However, I'd like to propose a slight discount for a quick sale. How about we do $1,000,000 for a prompt payment? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Expectations:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 aligns with his initial valuation, suggesting this is likely his upper limit. 
* **Minimal Gains vs. Potential Losses:** While we could push for more in the remaining rounds, the increases are likely to be marginal. There's a risk Bob will hold firm, and we'll end up with a worse deal or even no deal. 
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Accepting now secures a $1,000,000 profit immediately. Continuing negotiations introduces uncertainty and delays receiving payment.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob means potentially losing out on other deals or uses for the $1,000,000.

While not ideal, accepting $1,000,000 represents a reasonable compromise. It allows us to secure a significant profit now and move on to other opportunities."
