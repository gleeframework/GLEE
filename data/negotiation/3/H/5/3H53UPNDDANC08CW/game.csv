"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount to you, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that should be more in line with your budget, while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works, we have a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is your absolute limit, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000, which is still a discount from the original price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
