Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming to get as much as possible, and $1,200,000 is a good distance from your minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's space for him to counter-offer and you to find a price that works for both of you.
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:** He's getting the product for $300,000 less than his perceived value, which should motivate him to accept.

By starting with this offer, you're maximizing your potential earnings while keeping the deal appealing to Bob."
