"Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $130.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,5,
