I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's important to set the bar high to see if Bob is truly serious about buying and how high his own valuation might be. If he rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, Bob's counteroffer is too low. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product significantly. This should give us a good starting point for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  It seems like he's not willing to pay a fair price.  While I'd prefer to get more, John is a safe bet at $1,500,000.  I'm going to sell to John."
