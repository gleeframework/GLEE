Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's maximum gives him the impression of a deal while leaving me room to potentially negotiate down if needed. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob at a higher price is preferable to the guaranteed $150.

This strategy balances risk and reward by aiming for a higher price than my fallback option while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
