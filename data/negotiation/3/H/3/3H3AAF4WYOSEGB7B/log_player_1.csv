"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and open tone is important to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm mentioning the product's worth to me to emphasize the value he's getting."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $110 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$110 is still too low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Space:** I believe I can still get a better price.  
* **Maintaining Control:** Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to control the negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of my offer, relating it back to the product's value.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer brings me closer to Bob's offer, but still allows for some potential negotiation."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing my offer by a small amount to show flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:** I'm highlighting the need to reach a deal and that my counteroffer is a step towards that goal.
* **Finality:** I'm subtly hinting that this might be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept."
