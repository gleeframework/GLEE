Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential concessions and counter-offers.
* **Understanding Value:** You know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,500,000) than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Finding a Balance:** The offered price of $1,250,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value for you while still leaving Bob with a substantial profit margin ($250,000).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This offer doesn't account for any specific needs or constraints Bob might have. Gathering more information about Bob's situation could potentially lead to a more tailored and successful offer.
* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how much lower you're willing to go before accepting his offer or resorting to selling to John."
