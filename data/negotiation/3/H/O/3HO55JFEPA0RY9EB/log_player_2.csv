"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is only worth $8,000 to him, and Alice is offering it for $9,000.  He can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $8,200. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still too high for Bob, and he can get the product for his maximum price of $8,000 from John."
