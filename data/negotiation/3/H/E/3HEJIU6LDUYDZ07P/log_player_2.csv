"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $180. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that we're looking for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is way out of my budget. I could do  $60.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  Starting very low ($60) might seem risky, but it immediately establishes that we're serious about a deep discount.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, we try to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to our desired range.  
* **Leaving Room:** Even though it's a low offer, it leaves us plenty of room to negotiate upwards if Alice completely rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice moved considerably from her initial offer, $120 is still too high.  We've successfully moved the negotiation downwards, and there's room to push further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer presents a sense of fairness and compromise.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** $90 is a strong price point â€“ a good deal for us, but still profitable for Alice (assuming she values the product at $100).
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We're keeping the negotiation moving and encouraging Alice to continue engaging."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I can tell you're serious about this product. How about $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice is getting very close to her valuation and likely desperate to make a deal.  
* **John is an Option:** We're getting to the point where further negotiation might not yield significant savings, and John's offer of $100 becomes increasingly attractive.
* **Final Push:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're very price-sensitive and might be willing to walk away.  This could lead Alice to make one last, compelling offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I have to be honest, $105 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to offer $95 as my final price.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding our ground at $95, which is a strong position. We're also being transparent about potentially buying from John if we can't reach an agreement.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our ""final price,"" we increase the pressure on Alice to accept. 
* **Time Limit:** With only a few rounds remaining, we're subtly reminding Alice that we have a time constraint and other options available."
