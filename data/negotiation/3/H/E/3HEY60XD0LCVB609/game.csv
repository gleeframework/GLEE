"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
