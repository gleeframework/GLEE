**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still close to John's price.  I'll counter with a lower offer and see if we can negotiate a better deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is a good price.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000, and it's within my budget.  There's a chance I could negotiate even lower, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'll accept her offer and save a considerable amount of money."
