"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a good deal for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle somewhere around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a good deal for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $775,000? That's a significant move on my part and shows I'm serious about buying.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,7,
