"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. $1,050,000 is still above my minimum, but I think I can get closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal considering the value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I could do $1,075,000.  That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $25,000 less than my last counteroffer and is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiations."
