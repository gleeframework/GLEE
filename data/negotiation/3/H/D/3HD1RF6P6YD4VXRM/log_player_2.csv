"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum. He should reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum value as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $125 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still above Bob's maximum. This leaves room for Alice to counter without going below her minimum, and allows for further negotiation in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum value of $120 as possible. While $135 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum. He should reject and continue negotiating for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, which gives him time to try and reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I can offer you $130.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to slowly move closer to his maximum value. Offering $130 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price lower than Alice's latest offer. This gives Alice an opportunity to accept, but also allows Bob to potentially push for an even lower price in the next round if necessary."
