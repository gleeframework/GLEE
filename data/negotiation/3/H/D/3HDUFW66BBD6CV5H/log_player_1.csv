Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a good starting point because:

* **It's ambitious:**  It gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **It reflects the product's value to me:** $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, showing I believe the product is worth a lot.

I'm curious to see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **Reject Bob's offer**.  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. There's still room to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise: it's lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still allowing for some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept Bob's offer**.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and is significantly higher than what I would get from John.  I'm happy to close the deal and move on!"
