 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $5,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000

While Alice is moving closer to your desired price point, it's still worth negotiating further. You have room to counter before reaching John's $8,000 price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $5,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 5500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $5,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $5,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $5,800 is a good price.  It's getting close to your walk-away point, and further haggling might make Alice less willing to deal.  It's better to accept the deal now and secure a good price."
