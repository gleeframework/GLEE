Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that might work. However, $1,000,000 is still a stretch for me.  I could make this work at $800,000. That's the absolute top of my budget, and I wouldn't be able to go any higher. Let me know if that works for you.

``` 

This is a tough one, but here's why accepting $800,000 is the best move:

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated $800,000 is his absolute top. Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases. John's offer provides a safety net, but time is ticking.
* **Profitable, Though Not Ideal:** While $800,000 is less than your target, it's still a significant profit.  

Holding out for more money risks walking away with nothing if Bob sticks to his guns."
