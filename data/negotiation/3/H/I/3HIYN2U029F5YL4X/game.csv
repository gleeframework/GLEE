"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Could you consider meeting me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11,200? That's the lowest I can go and still make this purchase worthwhile for me.",11200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,300. This would be a fair compromise, and it still provides you with a great value for the product. What do you say?",11300.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,300. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,250? That's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,
