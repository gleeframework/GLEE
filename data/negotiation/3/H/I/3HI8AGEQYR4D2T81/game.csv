"Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $135? I'm trying to find a fair middle ground.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
