Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $150. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours. By starting high, you can gauge his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $120. This knowledge allows you to be more firm in your negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. While you could accept his offer to make some profit, it's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your desired amount. You have the security of John's offer, giving you leverage to push for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $135? I'm trying to find a fair middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):**  While still aiming high, you've come down from your initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** Providing a brief explanation (""fair middle ground"") makes your counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps you assess Bob's flexibility. If he's completely unwilling to budge from the $90 range, you can decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $120. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential loss of the sale."
