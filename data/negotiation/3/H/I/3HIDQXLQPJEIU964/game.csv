"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $50.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $50 is unfortunately way below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $50 was a low offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $65?  That's a fair price, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product.",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $65 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's reach an agreement so you can enjoy the product!",85.0,Alice,5,
