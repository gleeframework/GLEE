"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and buy from John if it gets close to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $50."",
""product_price"": 50
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $50 is unfortunately way below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice came down a bit, $100 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to move closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $50 was a low offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $65?  That's a fair price, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product."",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate upwards, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly below her previous offer. By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" it might feel more agreeable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $65 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's reach an agreement so you can enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm only $5 away from John's price.  I'll try one more counter-offer before conceding to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I can do $70, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer is my final attempt to get a better price from Alice. By stating it's my ""absolute limit,"" I'm signaling that I'm firm on this price and ready to walk away if she doesn't accept. This creates a sense of urgency for Alice to make a decision."
