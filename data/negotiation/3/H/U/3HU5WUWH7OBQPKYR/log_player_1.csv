{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good margin while leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that the product is worth at least $100 to Bob, given that it's worth $80 to me. If he rejects, we can start negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product for $90. It's a good deal for both of us."
