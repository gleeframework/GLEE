Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy Alice should use, followed by the offer:

**Strategy:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice knows she can get $1,200,000 from John, so that's her absolute minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **The Sweet Spot:** Alice needs to find a price that's higher than her minimum but still attractive to Bob. There's room for negotiation between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment at $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Fair:**  $1,100,000 leaves a good profit margin for Alice while still being potentially appealing to Bob if he sees enough value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk missing out. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible opening offer.  Depending on Bob's personality and negotiating style, Alice might adjust her strategy in subsequent rounds of communication."
