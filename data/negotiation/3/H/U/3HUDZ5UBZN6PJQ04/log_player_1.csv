Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also emphasizes the value you place on the product.
* **Alternative Buyer Incentive:**  Mentioning that you'll list it publicly (implying other potential buyers) creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You get a great deal at $19,000.
* **Bob negotiates:**  You have room to negotiate down towards $15,000, your minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
