"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I would be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $850,000. I'm confident this product will bring you significant value and a good return on your investment. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
