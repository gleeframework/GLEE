"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still far below the value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's quality and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for us both.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been very open to negotiation, but $980,000 is still far from the value of this product. To make this work, I'm prepared to come down to $1,020,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's fair considering the product's worth and allows us to both benefit from this deal.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1020000.0,Alice,7,
