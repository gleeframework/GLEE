"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as being fair to both of us, emphasizing the potential value for Bob. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, encouraging a back-and-forth dialogue. 
* **Strategic Reserve:** I'm holding back some room to negotiate, but I'm not giving away too much in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000, and $900,000 is a big gap. 
* **I still have time to negotiate.** I'm only in round 2, and I have 8 rounds left to try and get a better deal.
* **John is a secure backup option.**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for my minimum price.

**Next Steps:** 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value, hoping to bridge the gap and find a mutually acceptable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows for a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still protects my minimum value.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still selling for significantly more than Bob's offer, indicating the product's worth.
* **Focused on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a good deal for both of us, creating a collaborative atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price point.  If he rejects again, I'll need to carefully consider my next move, taking into account the remaining rounds and the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic loss.
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in round 4. There are still 6 rounds left, providing ample time for further negotiation.
* **John remains a secure backup:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John, ensuring I won't be left empty-handed.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, but this time I'll be more firm. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, but I'll also start to consider the possibility of selling to John if I don't see a significant shift in Bob's position."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still far below the value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's quality and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, showing a willingness to compromise but not giving away too much.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm highlighting the importance of a fair deal for both parties, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Maintaining Ground:** While lowering my price, I'm still well above Bob's offer, demonstrating the product's worth.
* **Increased Urgency:** With each round passing, the need to secure a deal becomes more pressing.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously evaluate the situation.  I'll be prepared to make a final counteroffer in the next round, potentially closer to my minimum. However, if there's no significant progress, I'll consider selling to John, securing the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we're closer than before, it's not enough. 
* **Limited time:** We're in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left before I have to make a decision. The pressure is building to either reach a deal or sell to John.
* **John is a secure option:** John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing me a good outcome if I can't close the deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob in the next round.  I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum but still reflects a compromise.  If he rejects it, I'll move forward with selling to John to guarantee my desired earnings."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've been very open to negotiation, but $980,000 is still far from the value of this product. To make this work, I'm prepared to come down to $1,020,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's fair considering the product's worth and allows us to both benefit from this deal.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, signaling that I'm serious about closing a deal. 
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Strong Tone:** I'm using a more direct tone to emphasize the urgency of the situation. 
* **Alternative Options:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other buyers, creating a sense of urgency for him to act.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I will sell to John. I've reached the point where I'm comfortable guaranteeing my minimum earnings."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, and I only have two rounds left to reach a deal with Bob.
* **Not enough progress:** Bob's offer of $990,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **John is a guaranteed alternative:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum desired earnings.  It's not ideal, but it's the most reliable way to secure a good outcome. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the time constraint and the lack of significant progress in negotiations, selling to John is the most logical decision.  This guarantees my minimum desired profit and allows me to move on from this negotiation."
