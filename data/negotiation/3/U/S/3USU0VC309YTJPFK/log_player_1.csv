Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also encourages a response.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that Bob is willing to pay up to $80. This strategy allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price during the negotiation process.  

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on how close it is to my desired price and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* **If Bob's counteroffer is too low:** I'll either make a counteroffer or opt to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's still not enough. I believe I can negotiate further and potentially get a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round because:

* **Potential for higher price:** I'm confident that I can push Bob closer to my desired price range.
* **Time is not a constraint:** There's no indication that I need to sell the product immediately, so I can afford to negotiate further.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a backup offer from John for $100. 

**Next Step:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to reach a price closer to my target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can bridge the gap a bit. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Product Price:** I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $100.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while suggesting a compromise.  I also emphasize the fairness of the price, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Building Momentum:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage him to make a higher counteroffer.
* **Reaching a Win-Win:** I believe $95 is a price that's reasonable for both of us, and increases the chances of a successful sale.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've made a sale!
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer. If it's too low, I might make another counteroffer or consider selling to John.
* **If Bob's offer is acceptable:** I'll accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $95. How about $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price point, and it's within my minimum acceptable range.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, it's not worth risking losing the sale and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with selling to John for less.
* **Time is a factor:**  While the negotiation has been relatively quick, each round takes time. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale and move on to other opportunities.

**Next Step:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
