"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While it's a good starting point, I'm aiming for something closer to $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I have to make a living, and $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $137.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is closer to his ideal, there's still room to negotiate a bit more.  He'll try to get the price down closer to $130 before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little too far from where I need to be. Let's try $135. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $135 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $138. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a few things to consider:

* **Alice's offer is close to his ideal price:** $138 is only $3 higher than his last counteroffer. 
* **Further negotiation could be risky:**  Alice is clearly sticking to her position, and pushing further could lead to more rounds and potentially a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob is already halfway through his 10 rounds, and John's offer of $150 is always a possibility.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures a deal at a price that is still lower than John's and within Bob's budget. It's a safe bet to avoid potential risk and secure the product."
