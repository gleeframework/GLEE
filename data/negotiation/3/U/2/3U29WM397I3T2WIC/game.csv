"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While it's a good starting point, I'm aiming for something closer to $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I have to make a living, and $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $137.50. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little too far from where I need to be. Let's try $135. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $135 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $138. What do you think?",138.0,Alice,5,
