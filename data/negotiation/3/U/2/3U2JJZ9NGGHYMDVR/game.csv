"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. My starting price is $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me and its potential value to you. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find common ground.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable return on my investment.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,700,000 is still too far out of my budget.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to see some flexibility on the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,200,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply not enough for me to sell this product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential, and I'm confident it can be a major asset to your business. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000, which is still a reasonable price considering the product's value. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still far below my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,250,000. This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to secure a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can feel it. I'm willing to stretch my budget further and offer you $1,100,000.  This is a very serious offer from my side, and I hope we can make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
