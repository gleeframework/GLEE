"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's still well above her minimum value of $800,000, and there's room for negotiation. There's a good chance we can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm going to have to pass on $1,300,000.  It's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm happy to continue the conversation if you're willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,000,000? That would leave us both with some wiggle room."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal. While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, this product offers you a unique opportunity for even greater returns.  I could come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a mutually beneficial point, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, the offer is still above my target price. I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my target price."
