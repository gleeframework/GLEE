Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  Therefore, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. Let me know if this works for you.

Alice has been pretty resistant to moving towards your price point.  It's unlikely she'll come down to $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. Cut your losses and buy from John."
