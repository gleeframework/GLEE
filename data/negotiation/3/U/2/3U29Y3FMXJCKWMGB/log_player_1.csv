Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price.  I'm confident that the product is worth $120 to me, so I'm not willing to go lower.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. It's a compromise from my initial price, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for further negotiations."
