Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still too far from what I can accept.  Let's compromise at $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can go.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go below $105, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer.  John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which meets Bob's budget."
