"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I am only able to pay up to $1400000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1450000 to see if we can reach an agreement. It's a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's keep the negotiation going. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1425000 for the product.
