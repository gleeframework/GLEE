Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 125}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $115. Since this is lower than my minimum price of $120, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a new counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $115, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $120. Here's my counteroffer:
