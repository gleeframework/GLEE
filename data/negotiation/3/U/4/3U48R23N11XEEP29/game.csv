"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I've done some research and I believe the product's value is not as high as you're suggesting.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still believe it's a high-quality item that can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay up to $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've learned from our conversation so far.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway in the previous round, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $1100000 is the minimum I can accept.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not willing to pay $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000, so I'll offer $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what we've discussed so far.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $1050000 is the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, so I'll offer $1000000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $1000000, so I'll offer $900000. However, I'm willing to go a bit lower than that, so my final offer is $850000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,8,
