Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150.  I believe it's worth every penny, but let me know if you have any questions."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've secured a great deal. If he rejects, you can always lower the price or move on to John, ensuring you don't lose out on the $100.
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which might sway Bob even if the price is higher than he initially intended to pay."
