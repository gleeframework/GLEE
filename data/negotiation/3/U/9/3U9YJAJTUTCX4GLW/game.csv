"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is far beyond my budget for this product.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $12,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $17,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident $14,000 is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's try to make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
