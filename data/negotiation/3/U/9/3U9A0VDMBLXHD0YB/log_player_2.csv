Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table.

I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 upfront, but I'd like to discuss the possibility of a payment plan that would allow me to pay in installments.
