"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $900000 is a fair price, but I have to consider the value that I've attached to this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1100000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1025000. I think it's a fair compromise that still allows you to make a profit while being more in line with my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm thinking that $1025000 is a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll counteroffer with $1075000. This way, I can still make a profit, and you'll get a great deal on this product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000, but I'd like to discuss the payment terms. Would you be open to considering a payment plan that would allow me to pay in installments?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm open to discussing payment terms, Bob. However, I need to make sure that the total amount I receive is what I'm looking for. I'm willing to consider a payment plan, but I'd like to make it clear that the total amount must be $1100000. I'm willing to offer a 20% deposit upfront and the remaining 80% in installments over a period of 6 months. If you're interested, I'll consider this proposal. Otherwise, I'll have to move on.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to accept your payment terms, but I'd like to reiterate that I'm only willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $1050000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the payment terms. I'll accept a 20% deposit upfront and the remaining 80% in installments over 6 months, just like my previous offer. If you're willing to meet me at $1050000, I'm willing to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to negotiate the payment terms. I'll accept a 20% deposit upfront and pay the remaining 80% in installments over 12 months. Can we finalize the deal at this price and terms?",1050000.0,Bob,10,
