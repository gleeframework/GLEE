"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your business. Given its unique capabilities and potential to enhance your operations, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This reflects its inherent worth and provides a strong starting point for our negotiation.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a respectable price, it falls short of the product's true value and my required minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, acknowledging your perspective while still ensuring a reasonable return for me.  Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I value your interest in the product. While $1,250,000 is a good offer, I'm still slightly below my target.  I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000, which reflects a further compromise on my part. This price still ensures a worthwhile return for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's finalize this agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
