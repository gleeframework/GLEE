"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your business. Given its unique capabilities and potential to enhance your operations, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This reflects its inherent worth and provides a strong starting point for our negotiation. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to you ($1,500,000). You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a respectable price, it falls short of the product's true value and my required minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, acknowledging your perspective while still ensuring a reasonable return for me.  Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate as you have 7 rounds left. You can try to meet in the middle or offer a slightly higher price than your initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I value your interest in the product. While $1,250,000 is a good offer, I'm still slightly below my target.  I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000, which reflects a further compromise on my part. This price still ensures a worthwhile return for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price range. You have 5 rounds left and you can still try to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again will give you more leverage to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a favorable outcome. Let's finalize this deal and move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1260000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,260,000 is a strong offer,  I'm still a bit away from my target price.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,265,000. This is a small step closer to your offer and gives us both a solid outcome. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,265,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,265,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,265,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,260,000.  You only have 3 rounds left. It's likely that you won't be able to get a significantly better price, and it's risky to continue negotiating. Accepting this offer will save you $235,000 compared to buying from John."
