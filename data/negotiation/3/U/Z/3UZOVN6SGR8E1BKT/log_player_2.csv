{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though Alice is asking for $950,000, it's still cheaper than John's price of $1,000,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so getting it for $950,000 saves you $50,000."
