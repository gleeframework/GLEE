Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure the product is worth $95 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $87.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $87.50 ensures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
