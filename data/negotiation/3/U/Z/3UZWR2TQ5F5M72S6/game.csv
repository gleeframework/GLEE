"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I'm not sure if it's worth more than that to me.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $165. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $165 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $150 for the product. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
