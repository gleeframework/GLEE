Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** This makes it attractive to him. 

Let's see how Bob responds and continue negotiating from there!"
