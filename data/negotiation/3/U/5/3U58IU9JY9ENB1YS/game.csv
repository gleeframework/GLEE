"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to offer $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need at least $11,500 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is my final offer, as I have another option available. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
