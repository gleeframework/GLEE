Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable to you, just as it is to me. I'm offering it to you first for $1,500,000. I think it's a fair price considering its potential worth."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum allows room for negotiation. 
* **Potential Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so a price of $1,500,000 represents a potential 50% profit for you. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value to Bob, you provide a reason for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer. In a real-world negotiation, you'd likely have multiple back-and-forths to gauge Bob's willingness to pay."
