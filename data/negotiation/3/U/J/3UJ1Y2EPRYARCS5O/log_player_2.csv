"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is less than your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer might make her propose a lower price, or you can always buy from John for $150."
