Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  It's a steal for something you value at $10,000!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $9,500 is a strong starting point, it might leave a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate.  
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed $8,000 from John. Offering the product to Bob at a significantly lower price wouldn't make sense."
