Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  This price is a good balance between being appealing to Bob (significantly lower than his perceived value) and maximizing your potential profit."
