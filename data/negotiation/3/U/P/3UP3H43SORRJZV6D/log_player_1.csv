Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is a strong psychological tactic. It's just below your minimum and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This might entice him to buy, thinking he's getting a good deal.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might push Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially in your favor."
