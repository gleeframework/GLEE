"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $600,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I could consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations here. While I want to find a deal that works, I also need to be mindful of the product's true worth.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000 just to keep the negotiation moving. This is a significant concession on my end.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has a lot of worth, but so does a good deal. I can meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
