"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10500.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price that's still a bit higher than your last offer. How about $11500? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11500 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $10750.  This is a fair offer that considers both of our needs.  Let's work together to close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my target. I'm thinking of a price that's still a bit higher than your last offer. How about $11200? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",11200.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  $11200 is still a little too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $11000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your needs while staying within my budget.  Let's seal the deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we do $11250? It's just a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to make it work.",11250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While I'm close to agreeing, $11250 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $11100.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11100.0,Bob,10,
