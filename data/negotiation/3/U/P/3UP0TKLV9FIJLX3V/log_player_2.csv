{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a fallback option with John for $15,000, rejecting Alice's initial offer of $12,000 makes sense. This allows you to see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** Starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price shows that you are serious about negotiating.
