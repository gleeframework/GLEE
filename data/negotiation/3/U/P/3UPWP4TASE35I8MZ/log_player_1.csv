"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground.  If he rejects outright, I'll have to consider lowering my price or going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,200,000, which is still well above Bob's initial offer, but closer to the middle ground.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more. Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my valuation and the middle ground. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,100,000. This is a further compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal. However, it's still a significant profit for me.  If Bob doesn't accept this, I'm getting closer to the point where I might consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to miss out on the potential for a higher price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one.  $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my last offer, but I'm approaching the point where I need to close the deal. This is the last offer I'll make before considering John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offers still below my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to John. The guaranteed $1,500,000 is a better option than risking a lower offer or a failed negotiation."
