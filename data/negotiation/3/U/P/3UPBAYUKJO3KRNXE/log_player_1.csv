"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than that to you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $12000, but $10000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to get a better price from him before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8500. It's fair for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $8500, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750, which is a fair compromise considering my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm also confident that I can sell the product to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8750, but I need to be closer to $9000 to make this work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8875?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8875}
