"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than that to you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $12000, but $10000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. ",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8500. It's fair for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $8500, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750, which is a fair compromise considering my budget. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8750, but I need to be closer to $9000 to make this work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8875?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think!",8875.0,Alice,7,
