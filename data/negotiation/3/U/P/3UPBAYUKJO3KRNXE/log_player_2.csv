Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiations with Alice are getting close to your maximum, but you're still not quite at your desired price. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sound decision to take that offer. You'll save money and avoid potentially going back and forth with Alice for the remaining rounds."
