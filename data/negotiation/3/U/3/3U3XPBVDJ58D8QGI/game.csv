"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but your asking price is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
