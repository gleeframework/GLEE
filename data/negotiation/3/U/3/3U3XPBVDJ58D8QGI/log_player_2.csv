"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He's willing to pay no more than $800,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's limit of $800,000. He can continue to negotiate or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has reverted to her initial offer of $1,200,000, which is still above Bob's limit.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price Bob is willing to pay.  Buying from John for $800,000 is the best option to secure the product at a price he can afford."
