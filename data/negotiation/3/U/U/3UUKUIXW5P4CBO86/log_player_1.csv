"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while still making a good profit.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for him to make the offer more enticing. 
* **Negotiation Mindset:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, indicating a willingness to compromise.

**Important Note:**  I'm choosing to start the negotiation with Bob because there's a chance I can get a higher price than John's offer. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  Let's start with that figure and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest in the product. This gives me the opportunity to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my leverage and control the negotiation. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm keeping John's offer as a safety net in case the negotiations with Bob completely fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a substantial value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's. 
* **Midpoint Negotiation:**  Offering the midpoint between my initial price and Bob's offer is a common negotiation tactic, making it feel fair and reasonable.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value the product offers Bob, hoping to persuade him to accept. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question to encourage continued dialogue and negotiation.

**Key Points:**

* This counteroffer keeps me closer to my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for further negotiation.
* I'm still keeping John's offer as a fallback option, but I'm optimistic that I can close the deal with Bob at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,125,000 is still below my threshold of $1,500,000. Accepting it would leave me with a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's still interested and willing to negotiate. This creates an opportunity for me to get closer to my desired price in the next round.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to guide the price upwards.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  John's offer remains a safety net in case the negotiations with Bob ultimately fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in Round 5, aiming to raise the price closer to my minimum acceptable price while still showing a willingness to compromise."
