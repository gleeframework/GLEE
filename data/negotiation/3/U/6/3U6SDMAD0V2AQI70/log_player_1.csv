{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $10,000 is above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's estimated value of $12,000, giving him a reason to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is straightforward and easy to understand, focusing on the value of the product for Bob.

Remember, this is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy and potentially make counteroffers or even consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and think it could be useful, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is your minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is still lower than your initial offer of $10,000, and you've already shown flexibility by dropping the price.  There's still room for negotiation to try and reach a price closer to your desired amount. By rejecting the offer and counter-offering, you can potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more than $8,000.  Considering the value of this product for you, how about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between your last offer and his offer. 
* **Reasoning:** The message highlights the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Finality:** This offer sets a clear price point for Bob to consider, making it easier for him to decide.

By presenting a reasonable counteroffer and focusing on the value proposition for Bob, you increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. However, I am still unable to go above $8,000 for this item. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has made it clear that he is unwilling to budge on his price of $8,000.  Since this is your minimum acceptable price, selling to John at the same price is the most logical choice. You are not losing any money, and you are saving the time and effort of further negotiations with Bob. It's important to recognize when a deal is unlikely to improve, and to take the best available option."
