"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing I have room to negotiate.  $2,000,000 is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me leverage and allows for potential counteroffers. I'm also emphasizing the uniqueness of the product to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1800000. This is the maximum I can afford at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is a decent sum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll use this round to see how committed Bob is and potentially get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,800,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, recognizing your interest in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I can offer $1850000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. We're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,850,000 is still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,875,000.  This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my willingness to work with you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I can offer $1860000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,860,000 is still less than I initially hoped for, we're getting very close to my desired price.  With only four rounds left, the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob or having to settle for John's offer outweighs the potential for a higher price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
