"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $800000.  I believe this price reflects the value you've outlined, while also ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1200000. This price allows for a substantial margin for you while still recognizing the product's unique potential. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is closer to what I can do, I still need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price with a little more discussion.",900000.0,Bob,4,
