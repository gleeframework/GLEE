"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't let it go for anything less than $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer!  I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we settle at $1,212,500? That's a compromise I'm comfortable with.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I'm willing to make one more move to get this deal done. How about $1,193,750?  That's right in between our last offers, and shows I'm serious about buying.",1193750.0,Bob,6,
