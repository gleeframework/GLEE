Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table if I accept his offer now. I'll try to push him a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I'm willing to make one more move to get this deal done. How about $1,193,750?  That's right in between our last offers, and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,193,750. 
You have three options:

Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,200,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer.  While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away and getting stuck with a lower offer."
