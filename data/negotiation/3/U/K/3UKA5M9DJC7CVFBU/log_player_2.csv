"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Let's make a deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is being a bit cheeky implying Bob would pay $12,000, her offer of $11,500 is still below Bob's maximum price. Accepting this offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John."
