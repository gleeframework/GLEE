Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves you some room to negotiate as well.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It clearly states the price and leaves the decision to Bob.

This strategy allows for negotiation while still ensuring you are likely to get a better price than selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price through further negotiation, but selling to John for $15,000 is still a more attractive option than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $9,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate.
* **Is still higher than Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Is closer to your minimum:** This helps you get closer to your desired price. 

You're trying to find a middle ground that allows for a potential deal while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your ideal.  John's offer of $15,000 guarantees you a significantly higher profit.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed higher price with John rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
