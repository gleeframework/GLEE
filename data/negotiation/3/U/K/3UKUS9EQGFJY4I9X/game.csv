"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $9,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
