Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($100) and slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** The message uses positive language (""great deal,"" ""valuable"") to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll likely counter with a price closer to $100, hoping to find a middle ground.
* If negotiations stall, I'll happily sell to John for $100, ensuring I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $100, but it's closer than his initial rejection. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my target price, hopefully finding a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $95 and $100. 
* If that's rejected, I'll assess the situation and consider whether to sell to John or continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $95?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make this sale."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between my desired price ($100) and Bob's offer ($90).
* **Appeal to Value:**  I highlight the ""great deal"" aspect to reiterate the value of the product to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation friendly.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a reasonable move that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still hold firm to my minimum value. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate my options.  If his offer is too low, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product, I believe $90 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** Bob is sticking to $90, which is below my minimum value of $100.  There's little chance he will go higher.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, ensuring a profit and meeting my minimum value.

**Strategy:**

* While I would prefer a higher price, the potential for further negotiation seems low. 
* Selling to John is the most logical choice to secure a profitable deal."
