"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great fit for your needs. My initial offer is $950,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm very interested in the product and I believe it has great potential, but I'm capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is a fair price, it's slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the product's value, but it allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $825,000?  This would allow us both to come away from this deal feeling good about it.",825000.0,Bob,4,
