Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will give us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us.  It's important to start low and see how Alice responds."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has lowered her price to $1,050,000. This is within my budget and closer to my desired price point. Continuing to negotiate could result in more rounds of back and forth, and I may not be able to secure a lower price. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids risking the deal falling through or having to buy from John at a higher price."
