"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  However, to be honest, $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. If you're able to come down closer to $8,000, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
