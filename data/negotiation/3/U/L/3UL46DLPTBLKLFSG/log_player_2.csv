"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's opening offer is a decent amount below my maximum price, but still significantly above her own valuation. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Alice is negotiating, but she's moving slowly.  I'll reject this offer to signal I'm willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down more significantly."
