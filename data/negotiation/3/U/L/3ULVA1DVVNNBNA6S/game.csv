"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget though. I could consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind.  How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you meet me at $12,000?  It's a win-win!",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's still a bit of a stretch for me to go to $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there! I'm willing to stretch my budget to $12,500. That's the best I can do.  Do we have a deal?",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to go to $13,200. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",13200.0,Alice,9,
