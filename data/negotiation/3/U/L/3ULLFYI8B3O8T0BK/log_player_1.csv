Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits and my budget. I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is still higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
