Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Its worth is significant, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very attractive offer."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** By emphasizing the product's value and uniqueness, you aim to justify a price higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,800,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that you believe in the product's worth, but you're also open to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.

**Important Note:**  This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob doesn't know your minimum selling price. If Bob knew you'd sell for $1,000,000, he would never offer more."
