"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal before committing. There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and sets a strong starting point.  I'm hoping to incentivize Alice to negotiate further, as $750,000 is still a significant profit for her if the product is truly worth $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $750,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $800,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still determined to get a good deal. It's a midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's last offer, which might encourage Alice to accept.  If she rejects, I'll still have room to maneuver in future rounds."
