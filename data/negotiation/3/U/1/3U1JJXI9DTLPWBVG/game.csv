"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in this product and am willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant step closer to my limit. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and the opportunity to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, it's still above my limit.  My final offer is $975,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
