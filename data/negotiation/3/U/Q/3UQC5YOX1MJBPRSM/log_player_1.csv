Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $108? That's the lowest I can go.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While $108 isn't my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum that I'm happy to close the deal. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $120, especially since we've already negotiated for a while."
