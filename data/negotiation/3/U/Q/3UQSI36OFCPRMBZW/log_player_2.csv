"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to get the product, $1,200,000 is still above Bob's budget.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. If that doesn't work, he has the fallback option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to try to get the best possible deal. He knows that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, but he's only willing to pay up to $800,000. This is his best offer, and if Alice rejects it, he'll just go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still a bit above Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget and much closer to his target.  There's a good chance Alice won't budge further, so Bob should take this offer. It's a good compromise, and he'll save $200,000 compared to buying from John."
