Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying above your minimum.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Highlighting that this is a pre-public offer creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency for Bob to decide.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $14,000, the wording implies flexibility. If Bob negotiates, you can potentially still secure a price higher than John's $12,000 offer."
