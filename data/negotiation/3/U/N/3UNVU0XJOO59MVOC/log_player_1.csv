Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is $750,000, which is lower than my initial offer of $850,000. However, it's still higher than what the product is worth to me ($800,000). I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

My counteroffer will be $820,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still higher than what the product is worth to me.
