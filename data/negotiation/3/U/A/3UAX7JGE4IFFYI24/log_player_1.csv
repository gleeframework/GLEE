Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 allows for some negotiation downward if Bob tries to haggle, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John gives you leverage. It allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or willingness to pay. In a real-world scenario, gathering information about the buyer can lead to a more tailored and potentially more profitable approach."
