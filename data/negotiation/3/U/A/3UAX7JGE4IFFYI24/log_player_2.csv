"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll reap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,100,000
* **Your maximum value:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay the same amount to John.  There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer, as you can get the product for the same price elsewhere."
