Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you and appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for $1,125,000.  This price reflects the product's value and represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and shake hands.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're close:**  The difference between your last offer ($1,100,000) and her current one ($1,125,000) is only $25,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** You have three rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll bridge the gap significantly enough to justify the risk of Alice not budging further.
* **John's Price:**  John's price is $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $75,000 compared to going with John.

While you could try to negotiate a bit more, the potential savings are likely not worth the risk of losing the deal at this point."
