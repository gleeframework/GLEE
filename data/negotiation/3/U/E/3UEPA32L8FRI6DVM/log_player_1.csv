"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if there's any room for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to accept $140 to avoid the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob walking away. It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $150."
