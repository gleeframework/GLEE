Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still end up with a price you're happy with.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""open to discussing,"" you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the ""significant value"" reinforces to Bob that the product is worth considering, even at a higher price.

While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it. If he rejects the initial offer, you have the safety net of John's offer at your minimum acceptable price."
