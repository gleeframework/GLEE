"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable going. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that would allow us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our perspectives, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our perspectives, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
