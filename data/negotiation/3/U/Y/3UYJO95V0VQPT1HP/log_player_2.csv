"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the first offer. This lets you gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Since you have a backup option with John, there's no rush to accept right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be aggressive early on, but not so aggressive that it immediately shuts down the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially with multiple rounds left. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise. By offering $850,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet her halfway while still staying within my budget."
