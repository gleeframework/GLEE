Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to offer it for $9,500. This offer won't last long, so let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your product's true value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $9,500 creates a sense of urgency and value. It's a significant discount from your ""true"" value but still a profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the message implies a take-it-or-leave-it tone, the high price leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price (which would still be profitable for you)."
