"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway there, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $920,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting close.  To meet in the middle, how about we agree on $880,000 and we have a deal?",880000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $880,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my costs.",900000.0,Alice,7,
