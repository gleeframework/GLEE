Round 3

Round 7

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $880,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my costs.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it seems unlikely she'll reach a price point that makes sense for us within the remaining rounds. We're still $100,000 away from our ideal price, and she's indicated $900,000 is her absolute lowest. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is a much better deal at this point. It's time to cut our losses with Alice and secure the product from John."
