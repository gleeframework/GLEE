Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly.  I think you'll find it's worth the price of $175."",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 
 
This offer balances a few factors:

* **Profit Potential:** Aiming slightly above Bob's perceived value allows for potential profit beyond your minimum.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, and you'll get your minimum from John. 
* **Avoiding Greed:**  An excessively high price might alienate Bob, making him less likely to engage."
