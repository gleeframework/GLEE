"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and can greatly benefit you.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's far above his maximum budget and he has other options.  There's no need to accept such a high price at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,400,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, given its potential value to me. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and we can finalize the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still above his budget. He's willing to pay $1,100,000, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to gain from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's ""final offer"" is still above his budget, and while he could continue negotiating, the risk is that the deal will fall apart.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, so it's the most logical choice."
