Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is more than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for something closer to $11,000, Alice.  How about $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting closer to my desired price and it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer is a good decision, as it secures a sale for a price above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
