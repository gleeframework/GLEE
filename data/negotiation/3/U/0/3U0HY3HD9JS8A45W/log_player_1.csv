While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my goal.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.
