Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you a strong negotiating position.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a safety net with John at $800,000, aiming higher allows you to potentially capture more of the value Bob places on the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair reflection of its worth, making it more palatable to Bob."
