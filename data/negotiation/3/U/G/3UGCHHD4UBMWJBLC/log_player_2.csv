"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Alice is offering it for $925,000.  While that's a lower price, it's still more than you'd pay from John. Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better strategy."
