"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! However, $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer, and propose $950000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $900000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can bridge the gap a little further.  How about $925000?  This would be a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $925000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $875000. I think this is the highest I can go and still stay within my budget. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,6,
