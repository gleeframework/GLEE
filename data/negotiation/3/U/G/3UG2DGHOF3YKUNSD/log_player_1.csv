``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000 but still higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This allows room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer or making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer, and propose $950,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $900000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. What do you think?

Bob's offer:
