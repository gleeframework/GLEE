"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire something incredibly valuable for a price that reflects its worth. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it holds.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and the guaranteed price from John. It makes no sense to accept her offer."
