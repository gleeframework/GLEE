Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down a bit (if he tries) while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation."
