"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120 by me. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it would be worth $100 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of the product,  $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable range.  This establishes a negotiation point and leaves room for compromise.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to lower her price a bit to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of the product for my business. I am unable to accept $90 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about if we meet halfway? I propose $105 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $95, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise. $95 is still within my budget and closer to my target price. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to move closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can agree on a price of $100. This is the highest I can go while maintaining the value of my product. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is exactly my maximum budget, and I'm comfortable buying it at that price. This is the best I can do with Alice, and there's no point in risking losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Plus, if I reject this offer, I'm likely to just end up buying from John at the same price anyway."
