"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very reasonable compromise, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's close this deal. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
