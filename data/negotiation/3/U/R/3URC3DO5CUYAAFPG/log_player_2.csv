Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can make this work.
