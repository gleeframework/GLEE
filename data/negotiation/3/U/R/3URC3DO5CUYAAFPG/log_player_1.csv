"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I want to try to get a better price from Bob before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a bit more from Bob, and I'm not quite at the point where selling to John feels like the best option. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very reasonable compromise, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  Even though he's willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum target.  Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point."
