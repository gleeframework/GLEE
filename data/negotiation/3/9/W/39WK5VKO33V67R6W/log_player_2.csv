"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate while staying well below our $150 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to get a better deal. $130 is still closer to our maximum budget than it is to Alice's minimum. Let's counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

We're now proposing a price that is the maximum Alice is willing to sell for. This might be our last chance to get a good deal before she loses patience or we have to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to considering selling to John, but I'm still interested in selling to you. I can do $125, that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While we could try to push for $120, we risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $125 secures a good price below our maximum budget."
