"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price.**  You want to spend no more than $15,000, and Alice is offering $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed way to get the product, but at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm serious about this product and I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to spend up to $15,000, and Alice is offering $11,500. 
* **The price is reasonable considering the value.** You value the product at $15,000 and Alice is willing to sell it for $11,500. 
* **There's a risk in further negotiation.** While you could potentially get a slightly lower price, there's a chance Alice might reject your counteroffer, leading to a higher price with John.

**It's a good deal to accept, saving you $3,500 compared to buying from John.**"
