Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm serious about this product and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
