{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your budget.  You can likely negotiate a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer and closer to my budget.  It also leaves room for potential negotiation if Alice rejects."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $950,000. This is still within my budget and a significant discount from Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Alice and we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my budget, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll make one final counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,000,000 as my final counteroffer. This is a compromise â€“ it's closer to Alice's offer, but still within my budget and significantly lower than her initial asking price.  If Alice rejects this, I'll go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,025,000, which is closer to my budget. However, it's still slightly above what I'm comfortable with. I've already made several counteroffers, and there's a good chance she won't budge any further. It's more sensible to accept John's offer at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
