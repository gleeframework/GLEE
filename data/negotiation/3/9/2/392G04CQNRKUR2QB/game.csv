"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  How about we split the difference again?  I'm willing to come down to $1,037,500.  This is a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product for a price that's still within your budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,012,500. Can you consider this offer?",1012500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,012,500 is still not enough for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a competitive price and me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,005,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to walking away from the deal.",1005000.0,Bob,8,
