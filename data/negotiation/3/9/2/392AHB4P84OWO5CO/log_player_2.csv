# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit your endeavors. Given its value to you, I propose a special offer at a price of $1,350,000. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the most favorable deal while allowing me to maximize the return on this valuable asset. I look forward to discussing the details and exploring how we can make this transaction mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have John as a backup option at $1,500,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a better price."
