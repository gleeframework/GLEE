"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $80? That's my absolute maximum, and it would allow us to close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
