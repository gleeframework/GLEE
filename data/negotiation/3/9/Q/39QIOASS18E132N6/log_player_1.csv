Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's a good price for Bob (slightly lower than his valuation) and allows you to make a decent profit (more than your minimum price).  Let's see if Bob takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than your minimum price of $80.  It's worth exploring if you can get a slightly higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your original offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, and allows you to get closer to your minimum profit.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but Bob's offer is now above your minimum price of $80.  It's better to accept the offer now and secure a profit, rather than risk further negotiation."
