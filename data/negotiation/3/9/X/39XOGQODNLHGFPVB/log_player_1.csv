"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $12,000 to me. Bob knows it's worth $10,000 to him, so there's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could walk away with $12,000 from John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating with him, but I'm not desperate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him, while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to settle for that price. I will counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal with him, and that he'll be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds.  I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John and keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm going to meet Bob halfway. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John.  I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision.  While Bob has come closer to my minimum price, we're still too far apart.  I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. This will guarantee me a profit and prevent further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
