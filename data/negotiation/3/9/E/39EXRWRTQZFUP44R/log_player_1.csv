Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to go below that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **For Bob:** He saves $200,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * **For Alice:** She earns $300,000 more than selling to John. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly."
