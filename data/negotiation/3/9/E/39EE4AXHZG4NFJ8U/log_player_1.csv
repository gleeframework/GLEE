Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The offer is significantly above your $80 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 gives you leverage in the negotiation. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
