"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've priced at $12,500,  knowing its worth to you.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and allows me to make a respectable profit.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",12500.0,Alice,1,
