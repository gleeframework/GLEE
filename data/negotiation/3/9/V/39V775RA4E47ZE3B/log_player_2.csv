Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable with. I want to see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $900,000, which is $925,000. I think this is a fair price that balances your needs with my goals. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. Since I have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it's the most financially sensible option at this point. The risk of further negotiation with Alice and possibly hitting a stalemate or ending up with a price higher than $800,000 outweighs the potential of a slightly lower price from Alice."
