"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell you this valuable product for $9,000. It's a rare find and I think you'll really appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, knowing John's offer is your backup plan."
