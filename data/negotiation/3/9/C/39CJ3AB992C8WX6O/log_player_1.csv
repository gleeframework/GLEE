Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $900,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $900,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still keeping us well above our minimum.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision without overthinking and potentially lowballing.

By setting the price at $900,000, we aim to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
