Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, even more so than your initial assessment might suggest. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true value and provides a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I need to aim higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Highlight Value:** By emphasizing the product's benefit to Bob, I'm subtly justifying the high price and potentially swaying his perception of its worth."
