# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.
