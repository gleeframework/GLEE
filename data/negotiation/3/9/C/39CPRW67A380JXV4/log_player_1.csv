Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still above my maximum value. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
