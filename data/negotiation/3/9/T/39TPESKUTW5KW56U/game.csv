"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant way off from my initial asking price.  This product holds substantial value, and I believe $1,120,000 is a more reasonable compromise. This still offers you a great deal.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving in my direction.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly as well.  How about $1,100,000?  This reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a significant return.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
