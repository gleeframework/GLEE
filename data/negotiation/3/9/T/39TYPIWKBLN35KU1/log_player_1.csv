"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way I can potentially earn more than my minimum target, and also allow for a back-and-forth to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $127.50? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $127.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $127.50 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, let's settle at $129.  This way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 129}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $129 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $126? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $126 is closer to my minimum than my previous offers, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have a few rounds left, and I'm willing to try and push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this.  I'm willing to go down to $128, but that's my final offer. If you're not able to meet that, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to go down to $128, but I'm still not comfortable with that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $128, which would be $124. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $124. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $124
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. While I'd like to get more from Bob, it's clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  There are only two rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's lower than my minimum. John's offer is a guaranteed $150, and that's the best option at this point."
