Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still aiming to keep my investment within $800,000. Based on that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's inching closer to my minimum price, $950,000 is still not acceptable. I have 6 rounds left and I'm determined to get a better price or sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer before I consider other options. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I have 4 rounds left and I'm aiming for a higher price. I think I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 with further negotiations."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway. While I appreciate your effort, $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. 

Even though Bob has come up to $1,050,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and I only have two rounds left. I'm not confident I can get a better price with Bob. John's offer guarantees me the price I want, and it's better than risking a lower price with Bob."
