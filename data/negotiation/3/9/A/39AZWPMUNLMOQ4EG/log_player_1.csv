Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's very interested.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, potentially motivating him to accept. 

This strategy aims to get Bob to accept a price that's very favorable to Alice, capitalizing on the fact that he values the product at $10,000."
