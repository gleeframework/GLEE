"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. It's a unique item that I know you'll find valuable, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm confident this price is fair given the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $850,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000. 

It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John to stay within your budget."
