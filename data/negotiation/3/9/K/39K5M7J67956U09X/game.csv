"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. It's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to give you a small concession, so I'm offering $130. It's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to give a small concession, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, so I'll offer $127.50. Can you consider that?",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $127.50.
