"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $120 right now. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $180.  I'm still a bit too high, though. Let's split the difference - how about $165?  I'm sure we can make this work.",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $190. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $165, which would be $172.50. Let me know if that works for you.",172.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $172.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $160, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",160.0,Bob,6,
