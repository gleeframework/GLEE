{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($80), it's still cheaper than John's price ($100).
* **Your goal is to save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for less than you would from John."
