"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $120 at most, and Alice is offering the product for $120, there's no need to negotiate.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point."
