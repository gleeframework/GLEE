"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is well above his maximum price point.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints but $8,500 is too low for this product.  It's truly exceptional and worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still outside of his budget. He should continue to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to offer $9,500.  It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $9,500 is still quite a ways off from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's settle this right now -  $11,000 and it's yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. He should continue to negotiate,  hoping Alice will come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $11,000 is still a stretch for me.  I can offer $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
