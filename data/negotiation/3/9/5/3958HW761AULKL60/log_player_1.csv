Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints but $8,500 is too low for this product.  It's truly exceptional and worth a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to offer $9,500.  It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $9,500 is still quite a ways off from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's settle this right now -  $11,000 and it's yours."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $11,000 is still a stretch for me.  I can offer $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.
