Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You're aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to that $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have John as a backup who will pay your minimum acceptable price, so you're not desperate.

By offering a price significantly below Bob's perceived value, but well above your minimum, you maximize your chances of a profitable sale."
