Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's potential profit to be made above your minimum price.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Offering a price of $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still maintaining a strong position due to your alternative buyer."
