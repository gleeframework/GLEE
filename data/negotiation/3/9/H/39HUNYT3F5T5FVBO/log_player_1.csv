Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way too high.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,700,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident that we can both walk away happy with this deal.

While I could push for a higher price with Bob, his final offer matches what John is willing to pay. Accepting Bob's offer now guarantees the sale and avoids the risk of the negotiations failing in further rounds."
