{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your true bottom line. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of scarcity and desirability, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the price, you can gradually lower it, but never go below your $1,200,000 safety net (John's offer)."
