"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this will prove to be a wise investment for you."",
 ""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm highlighting the ""incredible value and potential"" to frame the high price as justified.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aiming for a price that exceeds my minimum.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:** His reaction will reveal how much he truly values the product.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  Even if he counters, I'm starting from a position of strength.
3. **Maintain the option of John:** I can always walk away and accept John's offer if the negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price is still a great value for the product's potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  His message suggests he recognizes the product's value and is trying to be somewhat reasonable.  I'll aim for a slightly higher price before settling at $1,200,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment."",
 ""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but not drastically. This keeps me in a strong negotiating position.
* **Middle Ground:** Proposing $1,400,000 positions the offer as a compromise and encourages Bob to reciprocate with movement on his side. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm continuing to reinforce the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Maintain a profitable position:** I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price.
2. **Encourage a counter from Bob:** By meeting him partway, I'm prompting him to reveal more about his true willingness to pay. 
3. **Avoid a stalemate:** I'm actively working towards a mutually agreeable price while keeping the John option available."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,320,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,320,000 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), securing a healthy profit.
* **Bob's Limit:** His message indicates that this is his final offer. Pushing further risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value:**  We're four rounds in.  While I have time, closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and secures the profit. 

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and settling for John's offer makes this a pragmatic acceptance point."
