"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your willingness to negotiate.",10000.0,Bob,4,
