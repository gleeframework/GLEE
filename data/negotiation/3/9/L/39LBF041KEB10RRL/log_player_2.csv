"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for significantly less.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. He should continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $11,500 is slightly above his ideal price, it's still within his budget and a good deal compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise."
