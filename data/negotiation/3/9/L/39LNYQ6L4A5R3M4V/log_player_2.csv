"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $135. This means there's room for negotiation. 
* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $125?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $137.50, but I'm not willing to go lower than that. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but $137.5 is still higher than Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. 
*  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $131.25.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 131.25} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $139. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $139

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price. 
*  While it's closer than previous offers, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. 
* Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price that's more favorable."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $139 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $131.25.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 131.25} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go back to $131.25, Bob. I'm going to try to meet you in the middle again. How about $136.25?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $136.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, let's try to get this done. I'll offer $134.  I'm willing to meet you most of the way, but $136.25 is still a bit too high for me."", ""product_price"": 134} 
```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has made a significant concession, offering $137. 
* This is only $2 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $135, making it a reasonable price.
*  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and risking going to John for $150 might not be worth it.
* Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving some money."
