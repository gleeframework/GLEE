"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, you're not saving any money by accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price. 

Therefore, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
