{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  You can get a better price than $750,000, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to test the waters. Hopefully, Alice is willing to negotiate, and we can reach a price that's mutually beneficial."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down a bit, but $725,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $710,000. It's a small increase, but it shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise."

Alice is coming down in price and we are getting closer to a deal. This is a good deal for me and I want to secure the product before Alice changes her mind or the deal falls through."
