Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is definitely too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that my initial offer might have been a bit high for you. However, $80 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. What do you think?

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $120? This product is truly worth it, and I'm offering it to you at a significant discount from my original price."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $100? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $150 within the remaining rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob or running out of rounds."
