"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still more than the product is worth to him ($12,000).  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Bob can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's offer.  $7,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $12,000 to Bob. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a slight improvement over Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is comfortable paying. He has already rejected a higher price, so it's logical to continue negotiating to try and reach a more favorable price. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob might be able to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to meet Alice halfway, offering $8,000.  This is the midpoint between Alice's last offer of $9,500 and Bob's previous counteroffer of $7,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping a comfortable margin for potential savings."
