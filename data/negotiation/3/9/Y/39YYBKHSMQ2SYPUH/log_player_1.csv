Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can lower the price gradually, keeping in mind my minimum value and the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit. It's a significant amount lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's lower than I initially hoped, it's still above my minimum value and it's likely that further negotiation will result in an even lower price. Selling to Bob for $1,750,000 ensures I get a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation lowering the price even more."
