"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $600,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($600,000 vs. $800,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $650,000. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still below the product's worth to her ($650,000 vs. $800,000).  While it's closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $650,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $675,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 675000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of offering $680,000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my counteroffer, and only $20,000 below my desired price.  Considering that we have limited rounds left, and the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price, accepting this offer seems like the best option to secure a good deal."
