"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you, and a good return for me.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,300,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000. How about we try $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference one more time. How about we settle on $1,337,500? This gives us both a bit of what we want. Let me know what you think.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
