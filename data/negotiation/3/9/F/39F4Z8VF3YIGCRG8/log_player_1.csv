"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth at least $100.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while leaving space for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not in a rush to sell, so I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance by lowering my price from $95 to $90. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82.50. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $82.5 is still too low.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal.  If not, I'll sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price.  I'm willing to come down to $87.50.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my costs.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $87.50, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also trying to add a bit of urgency to motivate Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob. He's not budging much, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.  I'm going to sell to John for $100."
