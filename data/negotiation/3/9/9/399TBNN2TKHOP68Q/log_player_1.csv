Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think this price is more reasonable considering the value I'll get from it.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing Bob a bit further to see if we can secure a better deal before accepting a price that's significantly below our initial ask."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and we're now at $1,475,000. While not ideal, this price is significantly higher than John's offer ($1,200,000). Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away and losing a substantial profit. It's time to accept the offer and secure a good deal."
