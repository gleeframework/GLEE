Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit outside my budget right now. Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
