"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $150. I believe this reflects the value I see in it, and I'm eager to find someone who appreciates it just as much. Looking forward to your response!",150.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is more than $100. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to pay $110 for the product. However, given the value I place on it, I would need to adjust my expectations slightly. How about we aim for $125? This still allows us to find a balance between the value I see in the product and your budget.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $115. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I believe we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions. How about we set the product price at $120? This acknowledges the value I see in the product while remaining within your budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you.",120.0,Alice,5,
