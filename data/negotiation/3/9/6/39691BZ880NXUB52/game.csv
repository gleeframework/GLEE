"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to get my hands on this product.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're eager to make a deal, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $115 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to think about my costs and expenses. How about we try $125? It's a bit closer to what I was initially looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can do $118, but that's really as high as I'm willing to go.  It's a great product, but I have a budget.",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob! I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I was thinking we could try one more time to meet in the middle. How about $122? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit.",122.0,Alice,7,
