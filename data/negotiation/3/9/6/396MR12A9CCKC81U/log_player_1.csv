"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant amount, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to gauge his initial interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a higher price. There are 8 rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good amount for me.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal for me.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's a significant amount and I'm confident that I can make a profit.  I'm happy to close the deal now, rather than risk losing out by continuing negotiations."
