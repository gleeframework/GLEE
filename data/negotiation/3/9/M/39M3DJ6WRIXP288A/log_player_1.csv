Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it slightly below that at $1,150,000 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly, making him less likely to negotiate down too much.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, there might be some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's hesitant. Alice is prepared to negotiate slightly but ultimately has John as a backup buyer at her minimum price."
