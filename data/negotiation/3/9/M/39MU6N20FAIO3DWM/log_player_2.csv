Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would give us both a good deal.
