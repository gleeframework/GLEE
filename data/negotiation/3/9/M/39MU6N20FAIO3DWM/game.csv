"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my top offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This would give us both a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think about other options, and I'd like to hear from you if you're willing to meet me at this price or not.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $920,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle one last time - how about $935,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a valuable acquisition for your business.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other options.",935000.0,Alice,5,
