"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $11,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
