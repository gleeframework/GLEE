,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this item. It's a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
