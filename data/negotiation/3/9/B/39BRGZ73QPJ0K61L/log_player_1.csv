``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the dialogue open and encouraging negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial perceived value, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **More negotiation room:** I have 9 rounds left, and rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This will signal my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from my initial offer, but still remaining above my minimum.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer. 
* **Open to Agreement:**  I'm using language like ""find common ground"" to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage a deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still higher than his last offer. This will show my willingness to compromise while maintaining my desired profit margin."

Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a little too low for me.

Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** Using phrases like ""make this happen"" conveys a sense of urgency and my desire to close the deal.

**Important Note:**  I'm getting close to my minimum, and with only 3 rounds left, I need to be strategic. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely need to sell to John for $1,500,000 to avoid risking a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two rounds left:** With only two rounds remaining, I need to make a decisive decision. 
* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of a lower price:** If I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he might reject it again, leaving me with no choice but to sell to John for $1,500,000 in the final round. 

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of ending up with a lower price in the final round is too great.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
