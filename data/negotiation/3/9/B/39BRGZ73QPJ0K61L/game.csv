"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, considering the unique value this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the unique features of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get. Let's try to close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a little too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits this product offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,500,000. This would allow us to both walk away happy with a fair deal.  Let's make this happen!",1500000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
