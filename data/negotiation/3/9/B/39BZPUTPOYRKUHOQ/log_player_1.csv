"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum,  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still a good deal. It's more than what I'd get from John, and it saves me the time and effort of further negotiations."
