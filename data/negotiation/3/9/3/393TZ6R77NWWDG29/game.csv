"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our conversation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm looking for. I believe this is a reasonable price for both parties.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good chance for us to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to offer $885,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's worth to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
