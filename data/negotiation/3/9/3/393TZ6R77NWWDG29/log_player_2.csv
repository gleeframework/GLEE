"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our conversation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's still above his target value. It's worth exploring if he can get a lower price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm looking for. I believe this is a reasonable price for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and while $900,000 is better than $950,000, it's still above his target value of $800,000. He should continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's a good chance for us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to offer $885,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is still slightly above Bob's target of $800,000, but it's a significant improvement from the previous round.  It's a good compromise, considering Bob has only 5 rounds left to reach a deal before he has to consider buying from John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's relatively close to his ideal value, while also avoiding the risk of having to buy from John for a higher price."
