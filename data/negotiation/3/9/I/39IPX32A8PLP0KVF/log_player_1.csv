Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (You'll sell to John at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $200,000 (The difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that potential profit as possible without alienating Bob. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, making a rejection more likely.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential profit.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Framing it as exclusive adds perceived value and urgency.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the ""return on investment"" shifts the focus from the price to the benefit Bob receives. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly based on Bob's response."
