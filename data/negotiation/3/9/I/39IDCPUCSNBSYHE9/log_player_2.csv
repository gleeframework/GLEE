**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, Alice is offering it for $9,500. This is a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product and still save $500 compared to buying from John."
