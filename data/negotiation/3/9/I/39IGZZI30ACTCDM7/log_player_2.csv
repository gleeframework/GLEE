Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,075,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,087,500.  This feels like a fair compromise that's closer to both of our needs.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your coming down again.  $1,087,500 is still a bit too high for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $1,050,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,068,750.  This would be a fair compromise, and I think it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1068750}
```

Round 7
