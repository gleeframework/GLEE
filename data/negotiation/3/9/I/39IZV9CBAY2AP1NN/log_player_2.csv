"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down, especially since she values the product at $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer opens up the possibility of a counteroffer and allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  This is a good starting point for negotiation.  While Alice may not accept this price immediately, it establishes a lower price point and signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, although closer. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay the maximum I'm comfortable with, which is the same price John is selling it for.  This puts the pressure on Alice.  If she rejects, I can simply buy from John, and she risks losing the sale entirely."
