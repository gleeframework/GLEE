"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **First Round Strategy:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept in the first round, but I want to gauge his interest and set a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Value:**  $110 is still below my minimum of $150, so I can't accept it yet.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting the offer gives me a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage in this negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This would be a great price for both of us, allowing you to get a fantastic product at a good price and me to get a fair deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm narrowing the price difference, showing flexibility.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $112 is still too low for me.  Let's aim for a final offer. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  With only two rounds left, the chances of Bob increasing his offer to my minimum are slim.
* **Risk of Loss:**  Accepting $110 would be a significant loss compared to my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum value, avoiding any potential losses.
* **No Time for Further Negotiation:**  Given the limited rounds and Bob's repeated resistance, it's not worth risking further negotiation."
