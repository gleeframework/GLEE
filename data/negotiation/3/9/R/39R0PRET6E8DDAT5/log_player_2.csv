"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm starting with a price that's still attractive to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.

Alice is offering the product at your maximum budget, and it's the same price John is offering. There's no benefit to haggling further or buying from John."
