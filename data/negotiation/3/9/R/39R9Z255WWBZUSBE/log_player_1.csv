I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and still allows me to make a profit well above my minimum of $1,500,000.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that price right now.  I will counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a significant profit for me. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still a good profit for me, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely or me having to go through more rounds of negotiation.  It's time to close the deal."
