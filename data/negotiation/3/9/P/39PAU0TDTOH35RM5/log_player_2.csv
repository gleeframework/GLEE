# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000, there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob can continue to negotiate and try to lower the price further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still higher than his initial counteroffer, it's a significant discount from Alice's original price and a good deal for Bob. If he rejects the offer, he risks going back and forth with Alice for a while longer, and he may ultimately have to buy the product from John for a much higher price."
