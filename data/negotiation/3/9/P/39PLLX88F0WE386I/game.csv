"Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product for a limited time. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth.  What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more appropriate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $10,000.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $9,000 is cutting it very close to the value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $10,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
