"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and while his counter is a starting point, it's too far off for me to accept. I'll counter, but I need to move closer to my minimum.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $10,000.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob is getting closer to my minimum, and I need to decide if I'm willing to go lower or risk losing him as a buyer.  Since John offers a guaranteed $10,000, I'm going to hold firm for now.
