Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob saves $2,000 compared to his perceived value, and you earn $2,000 more than selling to John.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering Bob the product first, you create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, increasing the likelihood of him accepting. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to John."
