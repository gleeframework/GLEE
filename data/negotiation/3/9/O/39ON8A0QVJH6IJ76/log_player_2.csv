"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I think you'll find this to be a fair starting point given its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price point of $15,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  He's starting with a low counteroffer, knowing that Alice is unlikely to accept it immediately. This sets the stage for further negotiation.  He's also being polite and respectful, as that can help build a rapport and potentially lead to a faster deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and this offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $17,000 is still above Bob's budget.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate.  There's still room to bargain, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down in price. I'm still a bit too high at $17,000.  How about $15,500? I'm feeling pretty confident that this product is going to be worth it, and I'm really eager to buy it, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price point, but he's still trying to save money. This offer is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, but it's not a complete acceptance. This allows for further negotiation, while also showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product."
