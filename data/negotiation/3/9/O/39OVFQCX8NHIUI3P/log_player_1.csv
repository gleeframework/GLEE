Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $8,500, I'm hoping to get closer to my goal of $9,500. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is closer to what I want, I'm still confident I can get a bit more. I'm willing to counteroffer again, but if I can't get closer to $9,000, I might have to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $8,900? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product, and I'm sure it'll be worth the price."", ""product_price"": 8900}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $8,750 is still a decent profit for me, and I'm happy to close the sale."
