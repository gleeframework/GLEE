Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175, which is still above my minimum but acknowledges Bob's interest in the product. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, though getting closer. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160. This is a compromise,  closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this is attractive enough to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum and avoids further time wasted."
