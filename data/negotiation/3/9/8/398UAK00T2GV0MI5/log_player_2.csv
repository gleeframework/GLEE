"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable.  However, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision, and we can move forward from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice is bluffing. Even if she has another buyer, it's in her best interest to make a deal with you rather than risk losing your business entirely. By rejecting her offer, you force her to either lower the price or follow through on her threat. Since you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, you're in a strong position to negotiate."
