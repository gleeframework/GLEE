The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $15,000. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a lower offer of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping the price within my budget."

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500, which is closer to Alice's price but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, while also trying to keep the price as low as possible."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget, and I've already made a few counteroffers. It's getting close to my limit.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $10,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget."
