"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's value.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is still within my budget and reflects a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to consider a price of $725,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still a bit outside my sweet spot. I'm prepared to pay $710,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to come closer to my initial offer. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer. I think this is a fair compromise that balances our interests. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",720000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $720,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $715,000, which represents a solid compromise and a significant step closer to your offer. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",715000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to consider your offer of $715,000, but I need to think about it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $718,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise.
