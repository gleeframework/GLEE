,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you reaching out. However,  $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $102. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
