"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is outside my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $600,000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet halfway and consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. That's closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we try $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $725,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This feels like a fair deal considering the true value of this product. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. While that price is getting closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $775,000. I believe that represents a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Let's settle at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair given the product's potential.",825000.0,Alice,7,
