"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can save $3,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating further.  Since you value the product at $15,000, there's room to haggle with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000. This should encourage Alice to continue negotiations, and provides room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob.  He values the product at $15,000, and accepting this offer saves him $3,500 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or further delays is not worth the potential for a few hundred dollars more in savings."
