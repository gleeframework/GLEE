While I'm open to negotiation, I'm confident this product would be worth a similar amount to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a tempting option, it's more beneficial to stick with the guaranteed price from John, which aligns with Bob's maximum budget."
