"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $7500, but I'd be willing to go up to $7800 if you're willing to meet me at that price. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7800. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $7800, but I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to sell it to me for $7800, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8000",7800.0,Bob,6,
