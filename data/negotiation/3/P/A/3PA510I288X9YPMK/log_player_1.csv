{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,999. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to get as close to our minimum acceptable price ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John who will buy it at our desired minimum, so we're not desperate to sell to Bob at a loss.

By offering it at $11,999, we aim for a significant profit while still leaving the possibility of a deal that's (slightly) more appealing to Bob than our guaranteed sale to John."
