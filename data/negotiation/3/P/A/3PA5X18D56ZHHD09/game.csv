"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is my final offer, as I really need to sell this product and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. That's my final offer, I really think that's the maximum I can afford.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer, as I really need to sell this product and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,

I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $8000. Is there anything else you can do to convince me to buy from you?,12000.0,Bob,8,
