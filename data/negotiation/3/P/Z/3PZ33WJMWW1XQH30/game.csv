"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to make financial sense.  How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,400,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and its potential benefits to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer, considering it's a significant jump from my previous offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000, which is a $100,000 reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're trying to make this work, and I appreciate that. How about $1,175,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $1,250,000, which is $50,000 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
