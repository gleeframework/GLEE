,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  It reflects the value this product offers while being a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $11,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $10,750. This is my final offer.",10750.0,Bob,4,
