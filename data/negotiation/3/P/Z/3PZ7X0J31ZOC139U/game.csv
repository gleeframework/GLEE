"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? ",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $90?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $90 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. Let's try $92.50, a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say? ",92.5,Alice,5,
