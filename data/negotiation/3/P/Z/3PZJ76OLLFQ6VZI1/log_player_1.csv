"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great potential for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's potential to appeal to Bob's interests.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I leave the door open for counteroffers, showing flexibility. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  The success of this strategy will depend on Bob's actual interest in the product.  I'll need to adjust my offers based on his responses and the progress of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still High:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more than $850,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue exploring higher prices with Bob.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to potentially earn more with Bob.  

**Next Steps:** I'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob that shows I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrates the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I believe the value of this product justifies a slightly higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This would still be a significant saving for you, and it allows me to be fair to myself.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the value of the product, suggesting that $925,000 is still a fair price.
* **Middle Ground:** The offer is a ""middle ground"" between our initial positions.
* **Urgency Implied:**  The language ""Let's see if we can make this work"" subtly implies that I'm willing to negotiate further, but the offer is a good starting point. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he's still reluctant, I might need to make another concession.  However, I'll continue to prioritize maximizing my potential profit while staying aware of the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Let's aim for a price closer to $875000. I believe this strikes a balance between fairness for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, there's still a $25,000 gap, and I believe the product's worth justifies a bit more.
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Play:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob and signals that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.

**Next Steps:** I'll need to make a counteroffer that shows a willingness to compromise but also demonstrates the value of the product. I'll aim for a price between $875,000 and my minimum of $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 just doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $890,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product for your business. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a strong compromise, getting closer to Bob's offer while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Urgency Implied:** The phrase ""Let's make this deal happen!"" subtly adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Value Reiteration:** I reiterate the potential value of the product for Bob's business to justify the price.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping this final compromise will be enough to convince Bob. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, Alice. Let's try $880000. I believe this offers a fair compromise and keeps us within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is only $10,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, and it's significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Limited Negotiation:** With only four rounds remaining, there's limited time to negotiate further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential for further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Next Steps:** I'll accept this offer and secure the sale, ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum goal."
