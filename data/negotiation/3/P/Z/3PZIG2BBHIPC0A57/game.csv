"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and would allow for a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that we can reach a fair price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, which is a good middle ground considering my previous offer and your last one. Let's make this deal happen!",12750.0,Bob,4,
