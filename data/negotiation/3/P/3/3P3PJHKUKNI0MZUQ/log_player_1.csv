I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although it's tempting to accept $90, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob and I haven't been able to agree on a price. I'm getting a bit frustrated, and I'm starting to worry that I won't be able to get a price that's closer to my minimum. Therefore, I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $120. Although it would be nice to get a bit more, I'm happy with this outcome considering the limited time and Bob's stubbornness."
