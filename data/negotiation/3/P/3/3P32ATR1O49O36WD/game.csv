"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not sure I can meet you at that price. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend.
