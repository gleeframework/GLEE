* **Alice's value:** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice.
* **Your value:** The product is worth $10,000 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500. 

Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and negotiate with John to see if you can get a better price. You have more leverage knowing you have a backup option."
