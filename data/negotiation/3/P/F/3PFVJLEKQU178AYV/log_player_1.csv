"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than my minimum, I can still do better. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is a fair compromise and could potentially close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $120, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for $120. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and saves me time in further negotiations."
