# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for $1200000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is still a great price for this product.  It reflects its value and gives you significant savings.  What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, Bob still has room to negotiate. Rejecting allows him to continue the bargaining process and potentially secure a price closer to his target of $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, $1150000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. It's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to his target, it's still higher than what he can get from John. At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer.  It's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
