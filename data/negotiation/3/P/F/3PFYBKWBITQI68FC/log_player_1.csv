{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price above Bob's estimated value of $1,000,000 but still leaving room for negotiation. This creates a potential for a win-win scenario.
* **Motivating Language:** I highlight the ""opportunity"" and ""true worth"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, as this is a starting point.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup, ensuring I can still receive my minimum desired price if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and there's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.  

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point, potentially around $1,300,000 or $1,400,000, leaving room for further compromise."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Motivating Language:**  I highlight the ""great price"" and ""significant savings"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Clear Counteroffer:**  I've stated my price point directly, making it clear what I'm proposing. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I haven't given in completely to Bob's initial low offer, keeping some room for further negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1150000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.
