"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though, and would be happy to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as the product is still worth a significant amount to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and hopefully, it's a good starting point for us to find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to make a bigger jump in price. However, I still need to make a decent profit on this product. I'll counter with a price of $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to pay $11,000 for this product.  It's a fair price that lets us both come out ahead.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'll counter with a price of $12,750. This is my final offer, as I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,750 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair price that lets us both make a deal.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and we should wrap this up.  What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit on this product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,9,
