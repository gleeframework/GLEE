Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I could take the $9,000, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I'll counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a significant discount from my initial price, and it still gives you a good value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go a bit lower. I'd like to offer $9,800. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my target.  I'll counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $9,800 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a little more. How about we settle on $10,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $10,250. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm determined to get a better deal and will counteroffer again. I'm confident I can get a better offer by continuing to negotiate.  I've already rejected a couple of offers from Bob that were below my minimum price, so I'm not afraid to continue to reject offers until I reach my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,250 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer, so let's try $9,750.  This allows you to get a good deal while ensuring I can meet my needs.  Let's close this deal in this round!"", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $9,500. I'd like to make one more offer: $9,600. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's the highest he's offered so far, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  I'm not comfortable risking a deal with John for a few hundred dollars more. Accepting this offer is the most sensible option."
