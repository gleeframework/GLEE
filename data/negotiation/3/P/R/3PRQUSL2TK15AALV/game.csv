"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a significant discount from my initial price, and it still gives you a good value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go a bit lower. I'd like to offer $9,800. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $9,800 is getting closer, but I'm still looking for a little more. How about we settle on $10,000? This gives you a great deal, and it ensures I can reach my target price.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $10,250. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,250 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer, so let's try $9,750.  This allows you to get a good deal while ensuring I can meet my needs.  Let's close this deal in this round!",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going above $9,500. I'd like to make one more offer: $9,600. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",9600.0,Bob,8,
