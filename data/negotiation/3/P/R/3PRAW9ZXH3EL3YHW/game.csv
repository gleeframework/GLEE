"I appreciate you countering, Bob, and I understand where you're coming from. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $950,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $980,000, so how about $1,002,500?",1002500.0,Bob,4,,
