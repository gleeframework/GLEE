"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for us both, $1,100,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  I believe this price point reflects a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
