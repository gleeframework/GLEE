Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my target price, but still substantially more than my fallback option. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to gauge his flexibility.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for us both, $1,100,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  I believe this price point reflects a fair deal considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
