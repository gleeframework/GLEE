Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for us both, $1,100,000 undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  I believe this price point reflects a fair deal considering the value this product brings.
