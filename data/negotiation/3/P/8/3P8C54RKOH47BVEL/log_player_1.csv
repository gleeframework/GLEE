Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's a fair price to try and get, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is still too low for me, especially since I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to be flexible, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $12,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and still above my minimum value.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether, so it's time to finalize the deal."
