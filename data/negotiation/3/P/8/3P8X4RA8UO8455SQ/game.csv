"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is too far below what I need. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000. This still reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for us to find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable outcome.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
