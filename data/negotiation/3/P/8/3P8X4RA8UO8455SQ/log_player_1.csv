This offer sets a price point that is above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives you a starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum value. It's worth seeing if we can find a middle ground, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is too far below what I need. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000. This still reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for us to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum value of $1,500,000, and it seems like we're close to an agreement. It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk further negotiation."
