"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a lower offer of $10,750. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",10750.0,Bob,4,
