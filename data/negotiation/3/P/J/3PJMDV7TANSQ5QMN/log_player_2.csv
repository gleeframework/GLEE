# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $9500. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item at a great price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is within your budget of $12,000.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John.** 
* **Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy at a higher price from John outweighs the potential savings.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy in this situation."
