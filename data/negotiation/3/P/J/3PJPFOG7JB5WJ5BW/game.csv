"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is quite appealing, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  However, $8,200 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
