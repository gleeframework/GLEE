**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to go significantly higher than his current offer of $775,000.  While continuing negotiations is possible, the potential gains are now outweighed by the risk of Bob lowballing further or the negotiation getting stuck. Accepting John's offer of $800,000 guarantees a profit and avoids further uncertainty."
