"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for it, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for us both to make a deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for considering our product, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that benefits both parties. How about we set the price at $1250000? This still offers a significant profit while providing you with a competitive advantage in your market.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap.  How about we settle on $1200000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
