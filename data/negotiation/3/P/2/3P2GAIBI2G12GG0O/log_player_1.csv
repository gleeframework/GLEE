"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so this price is likely to pique his interest and start a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe there's potential to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price slightly from the previous round. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm holding out hope that Bob will come closer to my desired price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final concession, dropping the price to $1,050,000. This is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept and close the deal. If he rejects again, I'll likely sell to John in the next round, as I'm running out of negotiating room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of continuing negotiation and getting nothing is too high. Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum and secures a sale."
