"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $80, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. It allows for some negotiation room and lets me see if Bob is interested in the product at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'd like to try and get a higher price, even if it means a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be closer to a price we can both agree on, and avoids risking another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $80.  While Bob's offer is my minimum, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and don't see a strong likelihood of getting a higher price from him. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further rounds with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price or no sale at all."
