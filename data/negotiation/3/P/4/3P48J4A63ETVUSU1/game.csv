"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  Let's see if we can make this deal work.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a solution.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's try $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
