"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still above my target price of $1,000,000.  While John's offer is tempting, I can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows me to counter and see if I can close the deal for closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a solution.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to secure a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's try $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has gone back up to $1,150,000. This is significantly higher than my target price of $1,000,000 and even higher than her initial offer.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  John's offer is a much safer bet, even if it's not the lowest possible price.  I'll take the guaranteed deal."
