"Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,010,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, which is just a small buffer above your last offer. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1015000.0,Alice,9,,
