Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I value at $15,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate. 
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** This price gives me room to negotiate further if Bob rejects the offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not overly pressured to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **John is still an option:** I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I can always sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. Let's meet in the middle!  "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $11,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate and have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,000?  I'm really keen on this product and I think we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but still below it. 
* **Risk of lower offers:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck in a cycle of increasingly lower offers.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit, and I'm not willing to risk losing that opportunity for a small gain."
