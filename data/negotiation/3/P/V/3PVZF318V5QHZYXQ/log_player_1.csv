Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at his valuation or slightly above might seem insulting or leave money on the table. A price of $950,000 gives Bob a sense of getting a ""deal"" while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the message is firm, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. If he's highly motivated, he might agree to $950,000, or you could negotiate down slightly and still secure a better price than John's offer."
