Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem less desperate. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly above that might make him reconsider and counter with a number closer to his upper limit.  
* **Below John's Offer:** I have a backup offer for $1,200,000, so I want to aim higher than that while still giving Bob room to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while being aware of both Bob's perceived value and my alternative option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am only able to consider offers within my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating room for negotiation. Since I have a standing offer from John for $1,200,000, I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a counteroffer closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 represents the full value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By significantly reducing my initial price, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Above John's Offer:** My counteroffer remains strategically above John's offer of $1,200,000, preserving the option to sell to John if needed.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:**  I'm aiming for a price point significantly above Bob's perceived value, with the hope of landing somewhere between $1,100,000 and $1,275,000.

This approach balances my willingness to negotiate with my goal of maximizing profit, keeping in mind Bob's counteroffer and my existing alternative with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches John's standing offer. At this point, there's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations with Bob.  

* **Equal Offers:** Both Bob and John are now offering the same price.
* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Continuing with Bob might lead to a prolonged negotiation with little room for increasing the price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer is guaranteed, providing certainty and immediate closure. 

It's in my best interest to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of a stalemate with Bob."
