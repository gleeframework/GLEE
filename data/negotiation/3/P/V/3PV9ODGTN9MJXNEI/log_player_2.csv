"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John would sell it for. It's time to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range to initiate negotiation.  This leaves room to bargain upwards.
* **Expressing Interest:**  The message emphasizes that we're interested in the product, but only at a price that works for us.
* **Setting a Limit:** By stating  ""$80 is as high as I could go"", we're signaling firmness without completely shutting down the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $125 is still above our budget and what John is offering. We have room to negotiate further before considering settling or switching to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $95? I feel that's a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We are increasing our offer, but strategically and significantly less than Alice's decrease. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming to stay within budget.
* **Reiterating Fairness:** By again using the term ""fair offer"" we are emphasizing that we're looking for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Maintaining Alternatives:** We're getting closer to John's price, reminding us that we have other options if the negotiation doesn't go our way."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $110 is still above both our budget and John's offer. We are in a strong position to push for a price closer to $100. One more counter-offer is warranted before considering our alternatives."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price.  To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go. I think thatâ€™s a very fair price considering the market, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you're happy with that."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're meeting John's price, signaling to Alice that this is our final offer. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  We're using the phrase ""absolute highest I can go"" to communicate firmness while remaining polite.  Mentioning ""the market"" subtly implies that we are aware of other options.
* **Call to Action:** We're creating urgency by indicating we're ready to close the deal immediately if Alice accepts."
