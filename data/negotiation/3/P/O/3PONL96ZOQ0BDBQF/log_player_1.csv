``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving a profit margin.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob in my message, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. I have more rounds to negotiate and can still sell to John for a better price if needed."

Round 3

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
