Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it to you for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, it's always beneficial to start negotiations higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning a limited-time offer and listing the product publicly, you introduce a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating its value to you, phrasing like ""unique value"" subtly implies that the product is worth a premium price. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Remember, your lowest acceptable price is $12,000."
