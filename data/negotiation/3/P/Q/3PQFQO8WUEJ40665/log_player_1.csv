{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $145 is higher than your minimum of $150, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below John's offer:** This gives you some wiggle room to negotiate with Bob without losing out on the sure thing with John.
* **It's not too aggressive:** This leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like you're being unreasonable.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  Shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:** Shows I'm open to finding common ground.
* **It's still above my minimum:** Ensures I'm making a profit. 

Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $130 is a bit closer, but still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price.  I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a compromise:**  Shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **It's still above my minimum:** Ensures I'm making a profit.
* **It's a good price for Bob:**  It's a significant discount from my initial offer, making it more attractive for Bob.

Let's see if this is the offer Bob will accept."
