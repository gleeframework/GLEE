"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $130 is a bit closer, but still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
