Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Here's my message:

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.
