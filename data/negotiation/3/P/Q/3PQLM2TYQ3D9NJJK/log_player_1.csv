"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $925,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I value your time and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $925,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm flexible.  Let's meet at $940,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $940,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. What do you think?

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I've reached my limit with Bob. I'm running out of time and he's not getting closer to my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
