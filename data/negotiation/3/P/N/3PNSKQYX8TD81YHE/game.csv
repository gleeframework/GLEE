"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $77.50 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $81.25?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",81.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $81.25 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $79?",79.0,Bob,6,
