Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John offers a safety net at $100.

Offering the product at $115 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit above your minimum and John's offer. This strategy aims to maximize your profit by getting as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible."
