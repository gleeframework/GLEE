"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I am confident it would be an excellent investment for you. After careful consideration, I am extending an offer to sell this product to you for $11,000. This price reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my earnings while ensuring you receive a fair deal. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to discuss how this product can enhance your needs and goals. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her, potentially closer to her $10,000 valuation. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
