"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
