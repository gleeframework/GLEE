Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000. To make this a swift deal, I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,750,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob justifies the high asking price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to capitalize on Bob's potential eagerness to acquire the product, pushing for a higher profit margin.  If Bob rejects the offer, you still have the security of John's offer."
