"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make Bob more receptive. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and enthusiastic to encourage a deal. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far too low. It's significantly less than half my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, even if it means taking a slight risk by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's market value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Explanation:** I'm politely rejecting Bob's offer while explaining why it's unacceptable. This keeps the negotiation alive.
* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** I'm lowering my price considerably to show flexibility, but I'm still staying well above my absolute minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I'm framing the new price as a compromise to encourage Bob to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I need a price that aligns with my budget constraints. Could we settle at $700,000? This offer represents a significant investment on my part while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slowly increasing, $700,000 is still too low and far from my $1,200,000 minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further but need to demonstrate I won't settle for a low price. I'm hoping a firm stance will encourage Bob to make a more significant jump next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. To be frank, anything below $900,000 would be difficult for me to justify. I'm open to hearing your thoughts, but I believe that price accurately reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm being more direct about the price gap while reiterating my commitment to finding a solution.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $50,000, showing I'm willing to move, but it's a small concession to signal I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm still inviting Bob to share his perspective, hoping to understand his constraints better and find a mutually beneficial path forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $900,000 is a bit too high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe this demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase while respecting your bottom line. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased, but it's clear that his valuation of the product is significantly lower than mine.  At $750,000, we're still far apart, and it's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both of us within the remaining rounds. 

Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Further Time Investment:**  With only 4 rounds left, each round represents a significant portion of the remaining time.
* **Lowering My Position:** Further counteroffers could weaken my stance and make it harder to justify a price close to my minimum. 

Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and avoids further negotiation risks.  It's the most logical decision at this stage to maximize my profit."
