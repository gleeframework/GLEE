"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $85? I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $91. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $92.50, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position, but $91 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $89.50. It's closer to my range and we can both get a good deal.",89.5,Bob,6,
