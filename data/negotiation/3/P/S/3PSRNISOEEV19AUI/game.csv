"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value this product brings, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value to my business. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1000000, but I'm still a bit concerned that it's a bit too low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This represents a significant savings for me and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1080000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
