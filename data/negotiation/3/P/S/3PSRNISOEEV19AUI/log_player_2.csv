This is a good starting point. You can save a significant amount of money by negotiating with Alice.  Since you are aiming to save as much as possible, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1000000, but I'm still a bit concerned that it's a bit too low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You've already saved $200,000 by getting Alice down to $1,100,000.  There's still room to negotiate and save more. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation process."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This represents a significant savings for me and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1080000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you've already negotiated a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting the offer at $1,080,000 is a good decision. It secures the product at a price well below your initial budget and John's offer, and it avoids the risk of Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
