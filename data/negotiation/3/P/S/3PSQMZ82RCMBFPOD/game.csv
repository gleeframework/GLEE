"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That seems like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $7,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,000.  This would give you a great deal and still allow me to make a profit.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
