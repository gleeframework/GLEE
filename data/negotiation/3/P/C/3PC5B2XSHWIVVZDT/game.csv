"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our values, but I'm not willing to go above that.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise, and it still leaves you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,3,
