"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $70 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $80 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, so how about we try $85? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with.",85.0,Alice,5,
