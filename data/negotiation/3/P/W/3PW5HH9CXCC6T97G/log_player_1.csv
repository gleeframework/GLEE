Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $10,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message maintains a respectful and open tone to encourage a positive interaction with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable given the product's value to him."
