Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  $18,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer while still being significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to make a decision more quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically aims to make the offer more appealing.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point for negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward if Bob counters, but remain firm on not selling below your $15,000 minimum."
