"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than his minimum value, especially since he's likely to want the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is still above my minimum, and hopefully closer to a point where Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price of $10,000.  While I would prefer to get more, this is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
