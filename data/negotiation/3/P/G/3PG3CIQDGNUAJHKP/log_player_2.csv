"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy at this point.  You can then try to negotiate with Alice and see if she's willing to come down further."

Alice's offer:

You can still get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy. You can try to negotiate with Alice again and see if she'll go lower than $11,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This would give you a great product at a fair price, and it would also allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is closer to your target price. However, you can still get the product from John for $8,000. It's more advantageous to buy from John at this point."
