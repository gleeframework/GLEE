Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob is still getting a good deal.  

* **My perspective:** This offer gives me $400,000 more than selling to John, which is a significant gain.
* **Bob's perspective:** This offer allows him to buy the product for $300,000 less than its worth to him, which is a good savings.

By offering a price in the middle ground, I increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still achieving a favorable outcome for myself."
