Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $12,500 is a good price, significantly better than selling to John, and Bob seems unlikely to go higher."
