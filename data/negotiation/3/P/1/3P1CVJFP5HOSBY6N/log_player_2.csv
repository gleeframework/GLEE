```"

Round 3

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still too high for me. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I value closing this deal quickly, so how about $115 and we call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to pay $110, Alice is closer to my desired price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting her offer saves time and avoids the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer again."
