"Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,900,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'll offer $1,400,000, which I believe is fair considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
