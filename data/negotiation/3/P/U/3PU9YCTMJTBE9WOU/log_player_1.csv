Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $9,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is tempting, it's below my minimum value. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob, so I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still determined to get at least $8,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
