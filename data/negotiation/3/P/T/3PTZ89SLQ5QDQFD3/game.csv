"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $60. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the counteroffer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $90 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?  That would be a comfortable price point for me.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $85. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $85 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $75.  Would that be possible?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product for $80. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I hope you'll consider it.",80.0,Alice,7,
