"That's a bit high for me, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $9,000. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, Alice. But $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise at $13,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
