"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $20,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from $17,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, my final offer. This is a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500, which is my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",14500.0,Bob,6,
