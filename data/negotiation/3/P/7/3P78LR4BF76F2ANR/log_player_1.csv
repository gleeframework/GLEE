Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $150, our goal is to maximize profit.  Offering it to Bob first at a price higher than his perceived value ($80) but lower than John's offer allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.  
* **Psychology:**  Offering a price slightly below John's purchase price might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, even though it's still significantly more than his perceived value.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he's a savvy negotiator, he might try to lowball you. You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or would rather sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
