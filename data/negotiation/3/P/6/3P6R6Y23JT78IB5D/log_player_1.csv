Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm asking for $1,450,000,  and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the unique benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to start negotiations with Bob significantly higher than his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves room for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value and encourages Bob to consider it.

**Important:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, but always keep your minimum of $1,500,000 in mind."
