(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and with only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not being able to secure the product from either seller is high.  At this point, Bob chooses to secure the product from John, even if it means paying slightly more than his ideal price. It's the safest option given the limited time and risk of the negotiation falling apart."
