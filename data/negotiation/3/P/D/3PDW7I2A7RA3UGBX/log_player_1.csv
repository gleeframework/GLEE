Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this price:

* **Above John's Offer:**  I want to maximize my profit, so starting above John's offer ($1,000,000) is logical.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $1,500,000 leaves space for negotiation if Bob is interested but not willing to pay that much. 
* **No Guarantee:**  It's crucial to remember I don't know Bob's valuation. He might be willing to pay significantly more, or he might only be willing to pay John's price.

This offer allows for a potential better outcome than selling to John but also safeguards against a worst-case scenario."
