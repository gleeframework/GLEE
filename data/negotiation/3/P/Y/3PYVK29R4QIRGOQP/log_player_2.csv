{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to Alice's minimum price as possible.  $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but also demonstrates he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $915,000 is better than Alice's previous offer and getting closer to Bob's goal, it's still higher than his desired price.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to negotiate with Alice.  $912,500 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John, and with only one round left, the chances of getting a better price from Alice are slim. It's a good deal for Bob, considering he's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and Alice has also shown flexibility.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to close the deal and secure the product for a reasonable price."
