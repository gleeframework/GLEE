"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but I can't go as low as $14,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let me know if that works for you.",15500.0,Alice,3,
