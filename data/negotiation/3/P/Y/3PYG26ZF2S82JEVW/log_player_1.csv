"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good portion of Bob's perceived value. This gives us room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still quite low compared to my starting point.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering the price a bit from my initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is close enough to my target and significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm going to accept this offer and finalize the deal."
