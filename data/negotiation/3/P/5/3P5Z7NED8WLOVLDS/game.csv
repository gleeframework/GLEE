"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I was hoping to spend closer to $90.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it leaves me with a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice.  How about we split the difference and say $97.50? That seems like a fair compromise.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $102.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I'm not losing money on the deal.  What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer to a price I can agree on. How about we meet in the middle at $100 even? That seems like a fair and clean deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
