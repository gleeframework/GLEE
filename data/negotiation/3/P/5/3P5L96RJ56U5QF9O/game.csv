"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $10,200? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,200 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
