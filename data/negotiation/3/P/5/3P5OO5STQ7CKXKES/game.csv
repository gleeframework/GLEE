"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a unique opportunity for both of us, and I believe the product's value is worth a premium. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value you're placing on this product,  $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement that allows us both to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth a premium. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm getting close to my minimum, and I'm starting to think about exploring other opportunities. Let's see if we can make a deal happen.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and I'm still very interested in this product. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,080,000. This is a significant step toward your last offer, and I hope we can finalize a deal here.  Let's try to bridge the gap and come to an agreement that benefits us both.",1080000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that this might be my last offer, so I hope we can make a deal happen. Let's see if we can finalize this sale.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
