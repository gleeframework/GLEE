"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You have a clear maximum value of $1,000,000 in mind from John, so you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by making a significant drop from Alice's initial price.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and presents a price that's still within a range where Alice might be willing to compromise.  The message also reinforces the value of the product while highlighting your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a unique opportunity for both of us, and I believe the product's value is worth a premium. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value you're placing on this product,  $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving by increasing your offer slightly while still keeping it below your maximum value.

Let's see if we can make a deal happen.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and I'm still very interested in this product. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,080,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that this might be my last offer, so I hope we can make a deal happen. Let's see if we can finalize this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still higher than your maximum value of $1,000,000. While you could continue negotiating, you're running out of time and the gap between your desired price and Alice's offer is still significant.  It's more efficient and secure to purchase the product from John at your maximum value. This avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially leading to a higher price or a deal falling through."
