Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price.
* **Alternative:**  Mentioning a public listing creates a sense of urgency and competition for Bob. It implies that he might lose the opportunity to others if he hesitates.
* **Safety Net:** Knowing John provides a guaranteed $15,000 ensures Alice doesn't settle for less.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for a potential deal with Bob."
