"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product.  I believe it's incredibly valuable and would be a great asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we try $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to get closer to $11,000 for the product. Would you be able to do $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
