Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:** A positive and friendly message can encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $120 is a good starting point, giving Bob space to negotiate without immediately rejecting the offer.

**Important note:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150, so I won't be pressured to accept lowball offers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's expressed interest in the product. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150, providing a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Maintain optimism:**  I'm still expressing confidence in the value of the product and hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $95? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise and is still interested in the product. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **Safety net:** I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $100? It's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic, hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately sell the product to John for $150, as it is unlikely I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I've already made significant concessions.
* **Limited potential for further negotiation:**  It's unlikely that Bob will raise his offer significantly from this point.
* **John offers a guaranteed higher price:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a higher profit, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result than selling to John."
