"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $100 is less than its value to her, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with the guaranteed lower price."
