Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, knowing we have a fallback offer of $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always slightly decrease the price while still remaining well above our minimum. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By highlighting the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential value,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of its worth at a higher level. 

This approach balances ambition with the security of our fallback offer from John."
