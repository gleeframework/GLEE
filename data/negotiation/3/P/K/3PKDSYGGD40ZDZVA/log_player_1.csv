Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm intrigued by the product, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $600000 for it, assuming it meets my expectations.  Let me know your thoughts.

I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $675,000 again, but this time with a slight sweetener. I'm willing to throw in a premium service package worth $10,000, which will provide additional benefits and support to make the product even more valuable to you.
