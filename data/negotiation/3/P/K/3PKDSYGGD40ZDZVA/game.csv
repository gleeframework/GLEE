Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair and competitive price considering its worth to me.,850000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm intrigued by the product, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $600000 for it, assuming it meets my expectations.  Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $725000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business and personal life. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $725000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $600000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident the product will be worth it. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm open to exploring other options.",600000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to explore other options. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $675000. This is a significant compromise from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",675000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $675000 is closer to what I'm hoping for,  I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $650000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product. Let's make this happen.",650000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $675000 again, but this time with a slight sweetener. I'm willing to throw in a premium service package worth $10000, which will provide additional benefits and support to make the product even more valuable to you. This package is worth $10000 on its own, so I'm essentially giving you a $10000 discount on top of the already-compromised price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",675000.0,Alice,7,,10000.0
