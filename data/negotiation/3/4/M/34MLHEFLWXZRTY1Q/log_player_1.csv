"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to bargain down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $120, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob offering his maximum value right away suggests he might be willing to negotiate further. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between his offer ($80) and both my minimum ($120) and my initial ask ($160). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum price if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand that $160 is a bit high, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** Showing a willingness to come down in price ($20) demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to counter.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($120), giving me room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm prompting Bob to engage in the negotiation process and hopefully move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a little too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this, but my absolute limit is $100.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept.
* **""Absolute Limit"" Tactic:** While Bob claims $100 is his absolute limit, this could be a negotiation tactic. It's worth seeing if he's willing to budge a little more.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  There's a $20 gap between his offer and my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a price within that range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for being so straightforward. I want to make this work too. How about we split the difference and settle at $120?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** This offer meets my absolute lowest acceptable price.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm firm on this price. 
* **Fair Compromise:** We've both moved from our initial positions, and this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.
* **John Option Remains:** If Bob rejects this, I can still walk away and sell to John for the same amount."
