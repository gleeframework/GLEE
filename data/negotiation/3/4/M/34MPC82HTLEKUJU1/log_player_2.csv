"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm essentially giving you a discount of $1,000 just for being a valued customer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is clearly a bad deal - she's trying to sell you something for more than it's worth to you.  You should go with John.
