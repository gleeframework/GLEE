"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $120.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is within your budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice's starting offer leaves room for negotiation, or you can always go with John as a backup."
