Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $120.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price ($80).
* **Target Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes our potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting at $120, the message's phrasing allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John ($80), so we're not desperate and can confidently aim high with Bob."
