"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and what it can bring to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. After considering its value and my budget, I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a significant way off from where I see this product's value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,150,000?  This price reflects the true potential of what this product can do for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your latest offer at $1,150,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000, which I believe is closer to the value we both acknowledge. I hope this suggestion is more in line with what you're considering.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
