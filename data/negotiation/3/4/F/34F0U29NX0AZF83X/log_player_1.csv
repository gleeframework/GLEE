Round 2

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work out a better deal. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and I believe I can get him to pay a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
