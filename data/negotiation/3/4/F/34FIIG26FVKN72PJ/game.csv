,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115. This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,4,
