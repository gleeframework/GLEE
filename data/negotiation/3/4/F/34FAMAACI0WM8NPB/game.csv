"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it invaluable. My asking price is $900000. This reflects the product's unique value and potential. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I'm confident this is a great starting point.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $825000?  This would still be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a price that's fair and valuable to you.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another offer, $775000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  $775000 is closer to where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $800000 as my final offer.  This ensures a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the transaction.  Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,5,
