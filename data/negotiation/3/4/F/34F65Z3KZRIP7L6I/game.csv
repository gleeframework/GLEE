"Alice, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a significant step up from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
