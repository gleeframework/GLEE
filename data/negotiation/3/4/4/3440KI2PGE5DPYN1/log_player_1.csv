Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob's perceived value is unknown, so a higher starting price allows for potential concessions.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'm not willing to accept his offer, it's still a better outcome than selling to John for the same price. I'll proceed to the next round and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It's still above my minimum price, but shows a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
