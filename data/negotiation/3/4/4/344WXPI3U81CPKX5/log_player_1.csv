Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I will be moving forward with another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it slightly below this ensures you maximize potential profit.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:** By mentioning a deadline and another interested buyer, you encourage Bob to act quickly and perceive higher value. 
* **Justification for the price:** While not explicitly stating its worth to you, the message implies the product is highly valuable, justifying the price tag.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving you fully covered with John's offer as a safety net."
