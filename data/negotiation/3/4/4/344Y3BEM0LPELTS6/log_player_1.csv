Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides, but let me know if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer at $100, Alice wants to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it at $99 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.  
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While Alice could start at $100, it might turn Bob off and make him less likely to engage. $99 feels like a slightly better ""deal."""
