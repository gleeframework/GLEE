Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $800,000 (what I'd get from John).
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000.
* **My offer:** $1,200,000. This is a significant profit for me, but it's also within Bob's range of what he's willing to pay. 

By offering $1,200,000, I'm aiming for a good middle ground:

* **It's a good deal for me:** I'm earning $400,000 more than my minimum.
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** He's getting the product for $300,000 less than his maximum.

This strategy increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a substantial profit for me."
