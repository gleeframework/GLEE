Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $107.50. It's a fair price that's closer to your offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $107.50 is still more than my maximum price point of $100.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation rounds to potentially save a small amount. I'm better off buying from John and getting the product for my target price."
