"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I've already made several concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $915000. I'm actually starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is my last chance to meet you in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,9,
