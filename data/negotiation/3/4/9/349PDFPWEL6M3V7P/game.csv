"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $950,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away happy with this deal. Let's make it happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $925,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $910,000, which is a fair price considering our negotiations so far. Let's aim for a win-win scenario and close this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $915,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with this deal. Let's close this now.",915000.0,Alice,7,
