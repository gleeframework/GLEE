It's always worth trying to get a better deal.  Since you're willing to pay up to $100, there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a counteroffer of $40. This shows Alice that we're serious about buying, but we're also looking for a good deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$45 is a good price, especially considering Alice's previous offer. It's a decent saving compared to John and we're still within our budget. Let's take the deal!"
