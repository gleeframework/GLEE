I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I know the product is worth $120 to Bob, he'll likely counteroffer.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is too low for me, especially considering I know John is willing to pay $150. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $140.  This is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which might encourage him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful that I can get a little more.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130.  This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my previous offer."
