"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $120. It's not even worth negotiating with her at that price. You have a better option in John who is selling the product for your maximum price. However, since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice a price of $110, which is significantly lower than her offer but still within my budget. This gives her room to negotiate while still leaving me some room to bargain.  I believe it's a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $120.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still better off continuing to negotiate with Alice and trying to get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left to potentially get a better deal.  I can always go to John if I fail to reach a suitable agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $120. This is my final offer, as it's the highest I'm willing to pay. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll move on to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my ideal price, but it's within my budget and only $10 more than John's price. Since we're only halfway through the rounds, there's still a chance Alice might come down further if I reject this offer. However, it's not worth the risk of losing the product altogether.  I'm willing to accept this offer and save myself potential future rounds of negotiation."
