"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident that the product is worth more than this to me, so I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob if he rejects my initial offer.  I also want to see how he reacts to this initial price.  It will give me a better idea of his potential range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more to Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap.  I want to avoid selling to John at this point, as I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum and shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It also tests the waters to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm countering with $1,150,000. This is a smaller decrease than before, showing I'm becoming more firm in my price.  It's also closer to Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to reach a compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to finally accept a deal."
