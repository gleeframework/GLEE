Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is higher than my minimum value of $12,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. It also leaves the door open for a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a high offer to see if I can get a quick deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and negotiate.
* I also have the option of selling to John for $12,000, which gives me a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Strategy:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum. 
* If Bob continues to offer too low, I will consider selling to John as a backup option."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between my minimum of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500. This shows flexibility while still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express my willingness to negotiate. I emphasize the value of the product to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm aiming for a quick agreement by offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, while still being within my acceptable range.
* This counteroffer also leaves the door open for further negotiation if necessary. 
* I'll continue to evaluate my options, including selling to John, if Bob continues to offer a price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategy:**  Since this is his final offer and it meets my minimum requirement, it's in my best interest to accept.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether and forcing me to sell to John at the same price. 

**Why I chose to accept:**

* **No further profit:**  Any further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject, Bob might walk away, leaving me with no buyer.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Accepting ensures a sale at my minimum acceptable price, which is better than the risk of losing the deal."
