Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum ($80) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? This gives you a great price, and me a fair one.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach an agreement. Considering my budget, could we possibly settle at $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum price and I'm not sure I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
