Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of the product, $14000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for it, which is a fair price considering my value and the potential savings for you.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
