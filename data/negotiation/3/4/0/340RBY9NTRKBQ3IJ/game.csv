"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let's get this deal done!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that starting price is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable offer. How about we start around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your initial offer. However, $800,000 is far too low for this product.  Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000,  which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right that we're getting closer. To be honest, I have another offer on the table, but I value the negotiation we've built. If you're willing to come down to $1,050,000, I'll accept immediately. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other option.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have another offer, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop to $1,150,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges your value, but also reflects the true worth of the product.  This is my final offer. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
