"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is more than you are willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is still within my budget and hopefully a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my limit, it's still above my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise that's closer to Alice's last offer while still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, it's clear Alice is not going to budge much further.  While I could try to negotiate more, it's likely to be a long process, and John's offer is already a fair price.  I'll buy from John to avoid further delays and potentially a failed deal with Alice."
