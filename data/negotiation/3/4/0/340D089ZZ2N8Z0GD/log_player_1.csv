Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than selling to John, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000.  I'll counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to get at least $11,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better offer from him.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,500, just a little bit more than John's offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's fair.  I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can close the deal.  If not, I'm ready to sell to John."
