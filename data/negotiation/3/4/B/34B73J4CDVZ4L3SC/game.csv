"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1200000, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's discuss further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Considering its value to you and my budget, I'm willing to pay $950000. This price offers us both a good deal and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price is still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best option for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 still doesn't quite work for me. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
