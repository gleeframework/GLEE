Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Considering its value to you and my budget, I'm willing to pay $950000. This price offers us both a good deal and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $950,000 is still too low, and I think I can get more from Bob if I push a little harder."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best option for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.
