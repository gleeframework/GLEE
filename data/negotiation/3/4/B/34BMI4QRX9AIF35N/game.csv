"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $110.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $108.50.  This is my final offer.",108.5,Alice,5,
