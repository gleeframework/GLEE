"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm really hoping to get closer to $9,000. How about we compromise at $8,800? This would be a great deal for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",8200.0,Bob,6,
