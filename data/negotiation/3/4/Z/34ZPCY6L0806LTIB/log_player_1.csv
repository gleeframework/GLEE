{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I also want to emphasize the value of the product to Bob in my message to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 
I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. It's still above Bob's value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also reminding him of the value of the product to encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm really hoping to get closer to $9,000. How about we compromise at $8,800? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```

I'm offering $8,800 to Bob. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer. I'm trying to meet him halfway, hoping to close the deal before I have to sell to John.  I'm also emphasizing that this is a great deal for both of us, hoping to appeal to his sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and it seems like Bob is not going to budge much more.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's the best outcome for me, as it guarantees I meet my minimum value."
