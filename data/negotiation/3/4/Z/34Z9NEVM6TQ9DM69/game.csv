"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is significantly above my budget. To make this deal work, I'd need to come in at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $850000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. I'm confident you'll see the value in this product and I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product, and it allows us to both walk away happy. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $850000. Let's try $950000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling very comfortable with $900000. It's a reasonable price that acknowledges the value of the product while still staying within my budget. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's meet you at $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $920000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $900000.  This price is fair, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000. I've already made a significant concession, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $920000. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?",920000.0,Alice,9,
