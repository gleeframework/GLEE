"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation room while still ensuring a good profit for me. 
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on value:** I subtly mention the product's value to him, hoping to make the price seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given the value of the product to me, I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. I am willing to pay $1200000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price in the following rounds. 
* **John's offer is better:**  While not ideal, selling to John is still a solid option if I can't get a better price from Bob.  It ensures I meet my minimum desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but  $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to make this deal work. This price still leaves room for you to profit from the product and allows me to recover a good portion of its value.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm dropping my price, demonstrating flexibility, but still holding out for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize that the price allows for both of us to profit, making the offer more appealing.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation, keeping the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. I propose paying $1500000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum desired value.  It's a solid outcome for me.
* **No further potential:** There's no realistic chance of getting a higher price from Bob.
* **John's offer is the same:**  Selling to John would yield the same amount, but there's no guarantee that the deal would be as smooth as accepting Bob's offer."
