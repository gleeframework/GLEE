"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go.  It's also significantly higher than my minimum value, which is $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and even lower than what I would receive from John. I'm rejecting his offer and will try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering Bob my minimum price of $1,200,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me at this price, or if he'll continue to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close enough to my minimum price and still significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and reduces the risk of further negotiation."
