**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for a potential compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it's closer, I'm going to reject and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still staying below my maximum budget of $1,500,000. This should keep the negotiation going while also testing Alice's willingness to meet me halfway."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my target. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price, hoping that Alice will eventually come down to my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a genuine interest in buying from Alice.  This price is getting closer to her offer, but it's important to keep pushing for a lower price. If Alice rejects this, I'll likely be close enough to my budget to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or me needing to buy from John for a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice, as it saves me $100,000 compared to buying from John."
