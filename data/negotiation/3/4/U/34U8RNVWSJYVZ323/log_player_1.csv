Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in this product and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to secure the sale, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a profit.  $1,750,000 is a fair compromise, given my minimum price and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,600,000 is a good profit and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
