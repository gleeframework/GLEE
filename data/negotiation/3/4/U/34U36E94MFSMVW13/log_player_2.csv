Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's a better price than buying from John. It's a good compromise."
