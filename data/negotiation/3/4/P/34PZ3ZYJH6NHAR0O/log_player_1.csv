Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  This product holds significant value, and $1,400,000 undervalues its true potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,600,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and $1,600,000 is a substantial profit above my minimum. It's always possible to hold out for more, but there's a risk Bob will walk away.  It's better to secure a great deal now than risk losing him entirely."
