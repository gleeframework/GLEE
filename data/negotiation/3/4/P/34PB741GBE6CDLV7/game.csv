"Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12000 to facilitate a deal. This price still reflects the value I see in this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $9500 is close, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Would you be willing to consider $10500? This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to offer $9000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,6,
