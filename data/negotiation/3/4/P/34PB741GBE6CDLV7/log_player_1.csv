Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its potential benefits. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:**  This is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation. It's above my minimum value of $10,000, giving me some leeway.
* **""fair price"":** I use this language to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and potentially encourage him to accept. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting high, hoping to secure a higher price. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly with each counteroffer until I reach a point where either Bob accepts or I choose to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing money.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, but still lower than my initial offer. This keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to facilitate a deal. This price still reflects the value I see in this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial $15,000, but still above my minimum value of $10,000. It shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining some profit.
* **""facilitate a deal"":**  I use this language to emphasize my desire to reach an agreement.
* **""still reflects the value"":** This subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth and encourages him to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my desired range, but still leaving some room for further negotiation. This strategy keeps the negotiation alive and hopefully leads to a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum value of $10,000, it's still below that point. Selling at this price would mean I'd lose money. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still below my initial desired price. This will keep the negotiation going, hoping to push Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $9,500 is close, I'm still a bit short of my target price. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my ideal price. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet him halfway while still securing a profit.
* **""fair compromise"":**  I use this language to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and is being treated fairly.
* **""walk away satisfied"":**  This emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to push Bob closer to my desired price range with this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide whether to accept his next offer or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10500 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to offer $9000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm not willing to lose money on this sale. 

**Decision:**

Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which may result in an even lower price."
