Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so he might be willing to pay a bit more than your offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response, either up or down. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than your minimum of $80, and it's closer to your initial offer. It's not ideal, but accepting his offer guarantees you a sale and a profit."
