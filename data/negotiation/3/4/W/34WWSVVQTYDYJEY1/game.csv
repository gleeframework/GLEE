"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This represents a significant investment from your side, but I'm confident the product will deliver exceptional returns for you.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,375,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This represents a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for my business, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
