"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) but still within your budget. However, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This represents a significant investment from your side, but I'm confident the product will deliver exceptional returns for you.
