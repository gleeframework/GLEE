"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a fantastic deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $13,000?  This is a great product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but $11,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $11,500 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500. This is a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my bottom line. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,8,
