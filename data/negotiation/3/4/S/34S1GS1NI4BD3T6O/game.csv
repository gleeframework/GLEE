"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Given the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that's fair to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I've considered your offer carefully, Alice. While I respect your position, I still believe that $1,200,000 represents a fair compromise. However, I would like to propose an alternative at $1,250,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're comfortable with.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is closer, but it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,275,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've reviewed your last offer and while it's closer, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,260,000. I believe this strikes a balance between our positions and respects the value of your product. I look forward to your response.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
