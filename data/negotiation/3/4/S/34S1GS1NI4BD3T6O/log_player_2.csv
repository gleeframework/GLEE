Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Given the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that's fair to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.
