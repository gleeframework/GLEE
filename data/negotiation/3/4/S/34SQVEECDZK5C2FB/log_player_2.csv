"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice and $120 to you.  Alice's offer of $115 is better than buying from John, but you can likely get a better price.  It's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
