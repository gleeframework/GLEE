"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can offer. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $1,400,000? This would be my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
