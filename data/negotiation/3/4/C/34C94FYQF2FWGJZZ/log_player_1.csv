{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $120, but I want to leave room for negotiation with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 right now.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me, considering its value. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  That's a fair compromise, and lets us both walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm completely happy with. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not comfortable with $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
