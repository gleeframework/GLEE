"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and start a dialogue.

This strategy allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested at a price that still brings me closer to my desired value. If he's not interested at $12,000, I can adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he expressed interest in the product. 
* **Maintaining my position:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm serious about my value for the product and encourages further negotiation.

I will use the next round to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $9,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is significantly higher than Bob's last offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth of the higher price.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** The message ends by emphasizing that I am open to further discussion and finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** While Bob's offer is higher, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, indicating that there's potential for a better deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm still aiming for a higher price.

I will use the next round to counteroffer with a price that's closer to my target, but still within a reasonable negotiating range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value given the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my counteroffer by a smaller amount than before, showing flexibility and a desire to find a solution.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential to justify the price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""fair compromise"" and ""good value"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while slowly pushing Bob towards a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  Even with Bob's increased offer, we're still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is showing continued interest and is willing to negotiate further. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm still aiming for a higher price.

I will use the next round to counteroffer with a price that's closer to my target, but still within a reasonable negotiating range.  I'm hoping to push Bob towards a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 as a final offer.  This takes into account your budget and also reflects the value of the product for you.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it seriously."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tone:** I'm framing this as a final offer to signal that I'm serious about closing the deal but also willing to make a slight concession.
* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer slightly but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value and Fairness:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and positioning the offer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.

With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a solution that satisfies both of us. This offer is a compromise, but it's still closer to my target than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to our last two rounds.
* **Significant Gap:**  Bob's offer of $10,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Selling to John:** Given the limited time and the substantial gap in our desired prices, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $15,000.  This guarantees me my desired profit.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close a deal with Bob, the negotiation process has shown that he's not willing to reach my price.  It's better to secure a sure deal with John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
