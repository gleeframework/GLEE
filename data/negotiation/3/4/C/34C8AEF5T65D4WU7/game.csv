"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $9,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value given the product's potential.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 as a final offer.  This takes into account your budget and also reflects the value of the product for you.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",11500.0,Alice,7,
