"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $875,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping we can reach a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little lower than I hoped for, it's getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John. It's better to secure a sale at $860,000 than risk getting $800,000 from John."
