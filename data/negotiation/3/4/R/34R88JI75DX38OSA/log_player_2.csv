Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

At $875,000, we're getting a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might alienate Alice and she's clearly signaled this is her bottom line. It's time to accept and secure a good deal."
