"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I am interested in the product but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is valuable, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $850,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
