"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,875? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $12,875 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000,  which is closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's close this deal! ",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. How about we try $12,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay under $13,000.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to accept $12,875. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. ",12875.0,Alice,7,
