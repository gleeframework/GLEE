"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal.  ",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11500.0,Alice,5,
