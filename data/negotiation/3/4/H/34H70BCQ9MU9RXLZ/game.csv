"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's close this deal!",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,060,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $1,070,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1070000.0,Alice,5,
