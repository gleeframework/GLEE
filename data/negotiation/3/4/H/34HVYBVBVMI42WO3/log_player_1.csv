Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still keeps the price above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
