"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still outside of my comfortable range. Given its value to me, I'm happy to offer you $9800 for the product. This feels like a fair price for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9800 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I still think the product's value to you is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer you $10250 for the product, given its value to me.  This feels like a fair deal that allows us both to walk away happy.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to accept $10250, as I think the product's value to you is worth a bit more. However, I'm willing to meet you at $10750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to make one more concession to get a deal done.",10750.0,Alice,7,
