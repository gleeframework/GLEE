"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and the product is worth $10,000 to you, rejecting Alice's offer of $11,000 is the best first step.  You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your position, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great price for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

While $10,750 is closer to your target price of $10,000, it's still a bit higher than what you're comfortable spending. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can reach a price you're both happy with."
