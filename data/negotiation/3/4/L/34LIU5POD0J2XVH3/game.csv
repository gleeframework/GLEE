"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",13250.0,Alice,5,
