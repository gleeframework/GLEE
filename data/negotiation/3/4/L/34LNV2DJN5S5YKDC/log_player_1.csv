"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high price ($20,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While I value the product at $15,000, starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.
* **Not desperate:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm not desperate and want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting halfway:**  $17,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $20,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive language:**  The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my target price.
* **Not desperate:**  I'm not in a rush to sell and am willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value. Let's split the difference – I'm willing to accept $14,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering again:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility.
* **Splitting the difference:** $14,500 is halfway between my previous offer of $17,500 and Bob's offer of $12,000. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm positioning this offer as a fair compromise,  making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive language:**  The message is positive and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there yet. How about $13000? This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and not rush into an agreement that's too low.
* **Potential for better offer:**  I believe there's still a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, especially with the pressure of limited rounds. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations fall through, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle – I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is a fair compromise and would ensure a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering again:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate further.
* **Splitting the difference again:** $14,000 is halfway between my previous offer of $14,500 and Bob's offer of $13,000.
* **Emphasizing closing the deal:**  I'm using language that suggests a desire to finalize the transaction and avoid further rounds.
* **Positive language:** The message is friendly and focused on reaching a mutual agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not convinced that $14000 is a fair price.  I'm willing to go up to $13500. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's offer:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is only $1,500 away from John's offer of $15,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only two rounds left, there's not much room for further negotiation, and the risk of losing out on a deal entirely is high.
* **Guaranteeing a profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Avoiding potential loss:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalled negotiation, resulting in a potential loss.

While I'd ideally like to get a price closer to my initial asking price, it's more prudent to secure a guaranteed sale at this point."
