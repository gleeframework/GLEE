"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $10000 is far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value. Let's split the difference – I'm willing to accept $14500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there yet. How about $13000? This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle – I'm willing to accept $14000. This is a fair compromise and would ensure a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm still not convinced that $14000 is a fair price.  I'm willing to go up to $13500. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. ",13500.0,Bob,8,
