Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start at his valuation.  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows us to secure a price closer to our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" we create a sense of demand without being overly aggressive.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""proposing"" and ""what do you think?""  invite a counter-offer from Bob, keeping the negotiation going. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then decide whether to negotiate further or proceed with selling the product to John for her guaranteed $10,000."
