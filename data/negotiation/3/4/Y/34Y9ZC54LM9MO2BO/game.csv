"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1250000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. ",1250000.0,Bob,2,
