"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000.  I think you'll agree it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There are 9 rounds remaining, which gives Bob ample opportunity to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Given the value you mentioned, I'd be willing to pay $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to secure a good deal. He starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to initiate a negotiation that leads to a mutually acceptable price. By offering $12,000, Bob makes a substantial counteroffer while still leaving room for further negotiation.  This approach allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially secure a better price than he could from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He has 7 rounds remaining and can try to push Alice further down.  He wants to save as much money as possible, and holding out for a lower price could be beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Let's split the difference and come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a more aggressive approach, aiming to secure a price closer to his desired range. By offering $12,500, he's demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. He's showing that he's serious about buying the product, but he won't overpay. This strategy aims to put pressure on Alice to consider his offer and potentially close the deal within the remaining rounds."
