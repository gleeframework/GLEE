"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested, but please be aware that I have another buyer waiting in the wings who is willing to pay my full asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

Since John is willing to sell the product for your maximum price, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John. You save $200,000 by doing this."
