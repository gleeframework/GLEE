As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $8,800. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
