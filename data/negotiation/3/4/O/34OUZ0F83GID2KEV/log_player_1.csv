Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **It's a strong starting point:**  By offering a high price first, you establish your initial bargaining position and encourage Bob to negotiate down to a price that is still profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While it's tempting to take $9,000, it's still below your minimum desired price of $8,000.  You would be losing money by accepting.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Even though Bob rejected your initial offer, he is still interested. This means there's room to negotiate further and try to reach a price closer to your desired value. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While you'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, knowing that John is willing to pay $8,000 gives you a solid backup option if the negotiation with Bob falls through. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue negotiating and potentially achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing profit and negotiation:**  $10,000 is a compromise between your desired price and Bob's offer. It gives you a decent profit while leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining a strong position:** By making a counteroffer, you show that you're still open to negotiation but not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Emphasis on value:**  You're reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, making him more inclined to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is above your minimum desired price of $8,000, meaning you'll make a profit.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  Bob has already lowered his offer from $15,000 to $9,500. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price and could risk him walking away entirely.
* **Risk of losing to John:** If you continue to reject offers, there's a risk that Bob will eventually give up and you'll have to settle for John's $8,000 offer. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $9,500 is the most sensible decision, as it guarantees a profit and minimizes the risk of losing a better deal."
