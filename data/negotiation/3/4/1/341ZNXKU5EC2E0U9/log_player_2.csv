Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to your target, you still have room to negotiate. You want to try to push for a lower price, and you have more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $110. It's a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $112.50. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.5 is within your budget of $150 and represents a good deal. You've already negotiated a significant discount from her initial offer, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice rejecting your offers entirely.  While you could try to push for a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't go lower. You're in a good position to accept the offer and secure the product."
