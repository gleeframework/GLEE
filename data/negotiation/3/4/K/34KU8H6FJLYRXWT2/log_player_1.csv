Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $60 is significantly below my minimum value.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $90?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I could meet you halfway between our offers at $75.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum value.  To avoid further haggling, I'll sell the product to John for $100. This guarantees me my minimum value and ensures a quicker transaction."
