"I'm interested in the product, but $999500 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $975000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $960000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $960000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $970000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to know that you're serious about purchasing the product. If you're willing to commit to the deal, I'll sell it to you for $970000.",970000.0,Alice,5,
