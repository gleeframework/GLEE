"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to make one final offer at $8,400. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.
