Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and holds significant value for someone like you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield a better profit margin. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" and its potential benefits to Bob's specific needs aims to justify the high price.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, selling to John guarantees the minimum desired amount."
