"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle, how about $10,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with this product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
