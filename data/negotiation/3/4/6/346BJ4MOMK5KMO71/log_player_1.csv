Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" suggests a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you knew Bob was very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Conditions:**  If the product is in high demand, a more assertive starting price could be justified. 

This initial offer aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the door open for negotiation."
