"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering it's worth that much to you and I'm happy to close the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
