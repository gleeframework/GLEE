Round 7

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to $1,000,000, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and has given a ""final offer"".  While her price is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,080,000.  At this point, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of her walking away and you ending up with nothing. Buying from John guarantees you get the product and although it's a little more expensive than Alice's latest offer, it's still within your budget and avoids the risk of continued negotiation."
