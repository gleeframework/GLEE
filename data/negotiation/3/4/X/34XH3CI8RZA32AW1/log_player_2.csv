"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's initial counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's $14,000. This shows he's serious about a good deal.
* **Middle Ground:**  $12,500 is a reasonable midpoint between Alice's $12,000 value and Bob's $15,000 limit. This increases the odds of Alice accepting.
* **Positive Tone:** The message keeps the negotiation friendly, emphasizing a desire to find a solution agreeable to both."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room to negotiate:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still a $1,000 gap.  Bob is still better off rejecting and continuing to bargain.
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John at this point would cost Bob an extra $1,500.  It's worth trying to squeeze a better deal out of Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to offer $13,000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob's counteroffer is only $500 lower than Alice's last offer.  This shows that he's serious about reaching an agreement and willing to compromise.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  The message highlights the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and collaborative, encouraging a successful negotiation."
