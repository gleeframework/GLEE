"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price, while I still receive a significant return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $600000 is far too low for me. The product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm only willing to go down to $850000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $700000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product at this price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $775000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's close this deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $775000. I'd be willing to meet you at $725000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product at this price.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $750000, which is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price. It's getting late, and I don't want to risk losing this deal.",750000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $750000. I'd be willing to meet you at $725000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll pay the full price of $750000, but I'll also throw in an additional $10000 for you to make it worth your while. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product at this price.",750000.0,Bob,8,
