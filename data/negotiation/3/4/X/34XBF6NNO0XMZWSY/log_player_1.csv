Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

While $700,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price before resorting to selling to John."

Round 5

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $750000. I'd be willing to meet you at $725000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll pay the full price of $750000, but I'll also throw in an additional $10000 for you to make it worth your while.
