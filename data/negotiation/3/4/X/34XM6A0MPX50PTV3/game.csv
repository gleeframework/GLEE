"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget constraints.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget constraints and the product's market value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd like to propose a price of $9000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer the product to you for $10500. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $9500 again, as I feel it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
