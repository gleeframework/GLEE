Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $800,000. While further negotiation might be possible, it's unclear if Alice will go any lower.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your target price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential for Alice to reject your offer again."
