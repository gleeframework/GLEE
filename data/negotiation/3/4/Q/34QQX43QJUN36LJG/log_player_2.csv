"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $175 is significantly more than your maximum of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my maximum offer of $100.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's a fair starting point given my budget.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum, it's still a bit too high.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my $100 target.  There are still several rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $125. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's current price.  I believe this is a fair compromise and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."
