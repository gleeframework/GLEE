"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. How about $825,000? It's a fair price that's closer to your offer and allows me to meet my needs. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but I really need to stay within my limit. Can you meet me at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $775,000 is a good offer, but it's still a bit short of what I need.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $790,000.  This will allow us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
