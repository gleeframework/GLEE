Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge from his $80 offer. It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking a lower offer. John provides a guaranteed $100, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for less with Bob."
