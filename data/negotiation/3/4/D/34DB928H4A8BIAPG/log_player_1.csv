Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal, what do you think?"",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum selling price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial high price will be telling. If he immediately counters, you know he's quite interested. If he rejects outright, you'll need to consider lowering your price more significantly.
* **John as Backup:**  Remember, you always have John as a fallback option. This means you don't have to settle for a price significantly below $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below your minimum price of $150. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested. Rejecting his initial offer opens the door for further negotiation where you can try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll be happy with."",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise.  It shows you're willing to negotiate but also signals that you're not desperate to sell far below your minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's quality, you're subtly reminding Bob of its value and justifying the higher price point. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** Importantly, this price still leaves you with a profit margin above your $150 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $150 for the product, but no more than that. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matches John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches what you can reliably get from John. 
* **Avoids Further Risk:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a guaranteed sale at your desired price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob, it's often best to finalize a sale at a reasonable price point rather than dragging out the negotiation process."
