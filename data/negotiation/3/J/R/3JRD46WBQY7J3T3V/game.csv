"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you reaching out.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tight.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this deal happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for being flexible. I'm still a bit above my budget at $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward if it works for you.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,750 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's seal the deal!",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting really close!  $8,900 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,800?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",8800.0,Bob,6,
