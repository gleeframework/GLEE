Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,500,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a very competitive offer for something of this caliber."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $1,600,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be convinced that this is the best deal I can get. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to my desired price point.  We're moving in the right direction, but I still have room to negotiate before accepting an offer below $1,650,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your negotiating skills, and it seems we're getting close.  Let's make this simple: $1,650,000 and we have a deal.  This is my final offer, reflecting the true worth of this one-of-a-kind product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I think $1,550,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1.6 million, Bob is signaling this is his final offer and he's willing to walk away. Accepting $1,550,000 is a significant profit, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing him as a buyer entirely.  It's better to secure a strong offer now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer later or having to go with John's offer."
