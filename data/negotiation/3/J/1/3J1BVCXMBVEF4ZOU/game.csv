"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,500,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a very competitive offer for something of this caliber.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $1,600,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be convinced that this is the best deal I can get.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your negotiating skills, and it seems we're getting close.  Let's make this simple: $1,650,000 and we have a deal.  This is my final offer, reflecting the true worth of this one-of-a-kind product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and I think $1,550,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
