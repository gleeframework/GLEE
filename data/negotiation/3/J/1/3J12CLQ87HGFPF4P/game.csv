"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it looks great, $180 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it for $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $140 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement. How about we settle at $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. It's worth more to me than that. I'm willing to give you a last chance to meet me in the middle. I can offer it to you for $125. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,7,
