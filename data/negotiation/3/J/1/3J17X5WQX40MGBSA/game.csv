"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $800,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing you to secure the product at a fair price while ensuring I get my desired value.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget for $800,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",775000.0,Bob,4,
