"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. I also mention being open to offers, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Round 1 Strategy:** My goal in round 1 is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $120, but it's closer than his previous offer. 
* **Reject and Counteroffer:** I'm not ready to sell for $130 yet. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $150.
* **Strategy:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $130 is closer to my minimum, I still need a bit more to make this work.  How about $140?  I think this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer but staying below my initial price. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise while still holding firm on my value for the product.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on the value the product provides. This can help encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Strategy:** The goal is to push Bob closer to my desired price while still maintaining a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, considering your last offer, I am willing to go up to $135 for the product. I hope this meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $135 is above my minimum of $120. While it's not my ideal price of $150, it's getting closer.
* **Accept Offer:** It's getting late in the negotiation (Round 4 of 10). Accepting his offer secures a sale and prevents the risk of further rejections or a deal with John for a lower price. 
* **Strategy:** This is a good compromise, securing a decent profit while avoiding further rounds of negotiation with an uncertain outcome."
