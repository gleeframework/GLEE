"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that would still leave you a good profit. Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still confident this product is worth more than $900,000 to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
