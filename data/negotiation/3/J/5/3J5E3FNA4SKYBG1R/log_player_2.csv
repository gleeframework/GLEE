"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000.  This is a great price point for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get the price down closer to $800,000, which is the product's value to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that would still leave you a good profit. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still confident this product is worth more than $900,000 to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is closer to your desired price range.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a much higher price is significant.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a decent price and avoids potential delays and risks."
