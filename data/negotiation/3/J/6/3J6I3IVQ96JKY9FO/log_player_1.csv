"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  Would you be willing to pay $16,500? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose $16,000 as a compromise between our previous offers. This allows us to stay within your desired range while also keeping my budget in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and we're already four rounds in. It's time to secure a deal. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for my minimum."
