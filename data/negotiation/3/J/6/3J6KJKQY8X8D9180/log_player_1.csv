{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $75 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $75 is above your minimum, it's still below what the product is worth to Bob. There's room to negotiate further and try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $80 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is your minimum price, and selling to John would net you the same amount. It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
