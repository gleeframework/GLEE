"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $110 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium. I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection or operations. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the optimal strategy, even though it means paying the highest price."
