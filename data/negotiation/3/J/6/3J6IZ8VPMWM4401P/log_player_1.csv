Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,999. I know this product can be incredibly valuable, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim to get as close to my $15,000 value as possible.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives me leverage. I don't need to go below that price. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the price is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price slightly above $15,000."
