"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. It's priced at $9,500, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $7,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $7,750? That seems like a reasonable compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $7,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a little higher. How about we meet at $8,250?  It's a fair compromise, and allows us both to get a decent deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make this our final offer - $8,000.  That's my bottom line, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
