"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price that reflects the quality of the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $95? It's a compromise that's closer to where I'm comfortable.",95.0,Bob,4,
