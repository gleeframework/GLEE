"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price that reflects the quality of the product."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $95? It's a compromise that's closer to where I'm comfortable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting $95 is a good outcome in this scenario. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the deal entirely."
