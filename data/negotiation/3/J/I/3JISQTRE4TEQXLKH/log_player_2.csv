"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still too high for his budget, and there's room for negotiation.  He should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount. $1,100,000 is still well above his maximum budget, but it signals to Alice his seriousness in negotiating a fair price. This counteroffer is also within the range where Alice might still find it profitable to sell, given her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's maximum budget.  Continuing to reject and counteroffer increases the likelihood of getting a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise but also remaining firm in his desire to save money.  $1,150,000 is a midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, suggesting a potential meeting point. This counteroffer allows for a potential agreement while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price. It's important to remember that Bob can always choose to buy from John for $1,000,000. Therefore, there is still room for further negotiation with Alice.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate with Alice, increasing his counteroffer slightly to show his willingness to reach an agreement.  $1,200,000 represents a compromise from his previous offer, while still leaving a buffer between his maximum budget and Alice's last offer. This move signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also holding firm on his price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he wants to pay. Bob has already reached a counteroffer of $1,200,000 and can still potentially get a lower price. It is essential to keep negotiating, as there is a chance of getting a better deal. If Bob rejects, he might convince Alice to lower her price further.  However, if Bob is not comfortable with the risk of further negotiation, he could always choose to buy from John at $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but there is still a potential to save more money. By offering $1,250,000, Bob is showing a clear commitment to purchasing the product while also keeping some negotiation room. This is a balanced approach, leaving room for Alice to accept or counteroffer again. If Alice accepts, Bob saves a significant amount compared to his initial budget. If she rejects, Bob can evaluate the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than what Bob initially offered in Round 2.  This suggests the negotiations are not moving in a direction beneficial to Bob.  Since there is only one round remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of a final round of negotiations."
