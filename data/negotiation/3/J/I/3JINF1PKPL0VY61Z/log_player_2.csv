Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $975,000 is still too low.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and could be a great opportunity for you.
