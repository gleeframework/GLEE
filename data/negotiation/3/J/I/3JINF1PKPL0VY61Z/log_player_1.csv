Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll propose $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $987,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:

```

At this point, Bob is incrementally increasing his offer amounts.  While he might eventually meet an acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,200,000. Accepting his current offer or continuing to negotiate has a high risk of losing a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John."
