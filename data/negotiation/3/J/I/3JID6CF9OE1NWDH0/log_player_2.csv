"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you. I'm starting with a price of $9,000.  It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiating.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $9,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $7,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,250 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me. How about $8,000? That's my final offer. If you accept, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
