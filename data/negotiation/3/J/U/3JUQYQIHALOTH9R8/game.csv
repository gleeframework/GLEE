"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,3,
