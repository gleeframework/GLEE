"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that is significantly lower than its true worth to me.  While I value it at over $1.5 million, I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This represents a substantial savings for you, and a chance to own something truly special.  Consider this a unique opportunity, as I have another buyer ready to pay the full value if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
