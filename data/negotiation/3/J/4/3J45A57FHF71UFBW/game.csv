,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which still gives you a great price for a valuable product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $110. I would like to propose $100 as my maximum offer for the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
