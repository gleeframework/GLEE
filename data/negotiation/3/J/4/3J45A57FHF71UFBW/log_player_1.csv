{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $130 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from what the product is worth to me, but it still leaves me with a profit of $80.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. I'm highlighting the potential value he'll get from the product.

**Reasoning:**

* It's important to start with an offer that's enticing to Bob, but also leaves room for negotiation. 
* I want to create an atmosphere of collaboration, so I'm not being overly aggressive with my initial price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I also have the option to sell to John for $150, giving me a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John at a much higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** $90 would only give me a $10 profit, which is not worth the risk of losing a sale to John for $150.
* **Negotiation:** I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'm not going to be afraid to walk away if he doesn't budge.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to meet him halfway while still protecting my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which still gives you a great price for a valuable product.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but still maintain a significant profit margin. $110 represents a compromise, but it's important to remember I have a guaranteed sale at $150.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm also subtly reminding him of the product's value to encourage him to increase his offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** By showing flexibility and proposing a middle ground, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **Risk/Reward:** While $110 is less than $150, it's still a good profit, and I'm reducing the risk of Bob walking away. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response and be prepared to either accept his final offer if it's above $150, or stick with my $110 counteroffer if he's unwilling to budge further. If negotiations stall, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet at $110. I would like to propose $100 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is simply too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's not worth it to sell the product for such a low price. I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is significantly more profitable.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** Selling to Bob for $100 would only give me a $50 profit, which is not enough considering the product's worth to me and the risk involved in negotiating. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John ensures a higher profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm choosing the sure thing and selling to John.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach an agreement with Bob, I'm confident that I'm making the most profitable decision for myself."
