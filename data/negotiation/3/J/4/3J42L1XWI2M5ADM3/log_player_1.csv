Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since we know John will buy the product for $15,000, that's our guaranteed minimum. We want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a conversation. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, we have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, so we don't lose anything by attempting to get a higher price from Bob."
