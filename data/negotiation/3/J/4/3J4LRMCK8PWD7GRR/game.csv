"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a great price. Let me know if you're interested!",25000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $25000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $18000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $16000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer of $12000, so how about $14000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting at least $17000 for the product. How about we meet at $17000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",17000.0,Alice,7,
