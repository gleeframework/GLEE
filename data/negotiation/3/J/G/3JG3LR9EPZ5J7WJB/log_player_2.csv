"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a good price, but it's too early to accept.  We want to see if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows us to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $4,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer.  If she rejects this, we can adjust our strategy for the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,500 is a decent price, we're still aiming for a lower price.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so it's worth trying to push for a price closer to our initial counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer allows us to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, so I'm going to raise my offer slightly. This shows that I'm serious about making a deal but am still willing to negotiate. $4,500 is a good compromise point, and if she rejects it, we can reassess our strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point. While I'd ideally like to get it for closer to $4,500,  $5,200 is a reasonable price considering that we only have 5 rounds left. There's a chance she might not budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity altogether. Accepting this offer secures a good deal without jeopardizing the negotiation."
