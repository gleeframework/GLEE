"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
