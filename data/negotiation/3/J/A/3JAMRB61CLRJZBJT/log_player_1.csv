Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The ideal outcome is to sell to Bob for more than $1,500,000, but we need to be realistic. Offering a price too close to his maximum might make him suspicious or unwilling.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This offer stands for 48 hours, after which I'll be moving forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity and Value:**  The message highlights the product's value and Bob's privileged position.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still giving you a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Time Constraint:** The 48-hour limit adds urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, consider a price closer to $1,300,000, leaving him feeling like he got a better deal.
