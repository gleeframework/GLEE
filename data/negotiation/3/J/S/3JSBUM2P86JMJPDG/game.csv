"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,350,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you placed on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,325,000. That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will make this transaction a smooth one.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,325,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but that's as high as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
