Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to Bob ($12,000 vs $10,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and enthusiastic, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a guaranteed fallback if negotiations with Bob fail. This allows me to be more assertive in my pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is below my minimum threshold of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  I want to keep the negotiation going, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value. I believe I can get a better price than $9,500. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John's offer as a backup, which gives me the leverage to be more demanding."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer of $10,500 still remains above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and positive tone, keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  However, it's still below my target.
* **Time is Money:** The negotiation is taking time, and I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and not getting a better offer from Bob. The potential reward is minimal compared to the certainty of John's offer.

**Conclusion:** It's better to accept John's offer and finalize the sale, ensuring I receive my minimum desired price and avoid further delays."
