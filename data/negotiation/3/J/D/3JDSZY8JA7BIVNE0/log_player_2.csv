"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $10,000 for this exceptional item. I understand its worth to you is $8,000, but I assure you, investing in this product could potentially exceed that value over time. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, saving you $2,000. While Alice highlights potential future benefits, they don't justify exceeding your budget when you have a more affordable alternative."
