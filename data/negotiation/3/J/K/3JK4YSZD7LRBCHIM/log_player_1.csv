"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and to gauge his potential budget. If he rejects, we can then start negotiating down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $17,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get more. Bob has shown he is willing to negotiate, and I want to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a price closer to my initial offer. It's a good middle ground that could lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $18,000, which is only $2,000 below my original asking price.  I'm happy with that. Accepting this offer means I get a good deal and avoid further negotiation."
