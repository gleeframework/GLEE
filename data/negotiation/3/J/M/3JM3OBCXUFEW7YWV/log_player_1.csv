Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it for $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($70) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($30). This increases the likelihood of him accepting.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high offer price and a high probability of acceptance."
