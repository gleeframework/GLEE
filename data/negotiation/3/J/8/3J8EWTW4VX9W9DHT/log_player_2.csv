"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm suggesting a price of $140 for it. This price reflects the product's worth and allows us both to be satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer, or you can proceed to buy from John at your desired price point."
