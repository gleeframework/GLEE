"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $875,000. This is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I can go.",925000.0,Alice,5,
