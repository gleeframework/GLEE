"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have a fallback option with John, so you're not under pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this still represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. Since you have a solid backup option with John, there's no need to rush into accepting. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
