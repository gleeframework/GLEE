"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $100, Bob. I've already met you halfway once, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
