Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than $80, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $87 is getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. "", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to consider a price of $84? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offers are getting too low for me.  I'm not comfortable going below $85, and it seems like Bob is not willing to go any higher.  I'm better off selling to John for $80, as it's still above my minimum price of $80, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price after several more rounds of negotiation."
