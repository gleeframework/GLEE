Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm open to offers, but I'm starting at $20,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low for me, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is unfortunately too far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping for $17,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $14,000 is a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $15,000.  It's also important to consider that we are on round 4, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
