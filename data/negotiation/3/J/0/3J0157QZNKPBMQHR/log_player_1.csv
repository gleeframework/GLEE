Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be valuable to your business. I've set the price at $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer because I can get the same amount from John. There's no point in selling for the minimum price if there's potential to get a better price by negotiating. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go as low as $800,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects the value I believe it brings to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than what John is offering, and it's within a reasonable range considering Bob's budget.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
