Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price?

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we're getting into the later rounds. While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, accepting $1,350,000 guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or running out of negotiation rounds."
