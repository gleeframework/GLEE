"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1000000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975000 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1012500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1012500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",980000.0,Bob,6,
