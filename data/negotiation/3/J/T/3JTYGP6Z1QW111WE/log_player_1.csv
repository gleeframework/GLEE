Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe I can get a better price from Bob or John. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also want to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it seems unlikely we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'll choose to sell the product to him."
