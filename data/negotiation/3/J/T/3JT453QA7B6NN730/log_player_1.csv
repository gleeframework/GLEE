"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,800,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value and potential of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've left the door open for counteroffers,  making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

*  The goal is to get the highest possible price, but also to keep Bob engaged.  Starting high allows for potential concessions later on without feeling pressured.  
* The threat of selling to John provides a real deadline for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,500,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I can't afford to accept this offer.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I still have time to counter-offer and potentially get a better price.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  While $1,200,000 is acceptable, I'm hoping to get more through negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offering, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I need to find a balance between securing a good price and not alienating Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, considering the value I see in the product for you. I'm open to continuing this discussion, but time is of the essence."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I've countered with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial asking price, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to justify my price.
* **Time Pressure:**  I mention the time constraint to emphasize the urgency of reaching a deal.  

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** The counteroffer aims to meet somewhere in the middle, hoping to incentivize Bob to come up from his current offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The counteroffer still maintains a strong price point, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Balancing urgency with opportunity:** I use the ""time is of the essence"" line to remind Bob that there's a deadline without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and am willing to consider a price closer to your last proposal. I would like to suggest $1600000 as a potential compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Progress in Negotiation:** Bob has significantly increased his offer from $1,500,000 to $1,600,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Close to Minimum:**  While $1,600,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of rejecting this offer and going through further rounds of negotiation is high. It's possible that Bob won't budge further, or I might not be able to reach a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure a Good Price:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale at a price that's significantly better than selling to John.
* **Time Factor:**  Given the limited rounds, accepting this offer reduces the risk of losing out on a good deal.
* **Future Potential:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, I'll still be looking for opportunities to improve the relationship with Bob for future potential deals."
