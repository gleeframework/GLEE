Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle on $1,300,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a price point that works for me. Accepting $1,300,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or him walking away."
