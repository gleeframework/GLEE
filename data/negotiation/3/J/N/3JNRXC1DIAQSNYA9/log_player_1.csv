Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000 by continuing the negotiation.  It's too early to sell to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied. It's worth trying for another round to see if I can push him closer to $10,500.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your effort to meet halfway, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $10,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm offering $9,750. I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,750.  While it's still below my initial goal, it's a good compromise and I'm concerned that I'll lose him as a buyer if I continue to counteroffer.  The time is getting late in the negotiation. It's a better deal than selling to John at this point."
