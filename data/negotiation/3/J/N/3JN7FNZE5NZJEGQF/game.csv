"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
