# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
