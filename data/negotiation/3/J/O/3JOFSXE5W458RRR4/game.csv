"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  The product looks great, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response! I understand your position, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $13,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would that work for you?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer!  $11,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and reflects the value this product will bring you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
