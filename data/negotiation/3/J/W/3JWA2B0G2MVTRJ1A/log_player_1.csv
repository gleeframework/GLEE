Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $200, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to negotiation:** By stating I'm open to negotiation, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to create interest. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get a better price than John's offer, but also provides a safety net if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  While I'd prefer more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him or another buyer.  Selling to Bob at $150 ensures a quick and certain sale, guaranteeing me my minimum desired profit."
