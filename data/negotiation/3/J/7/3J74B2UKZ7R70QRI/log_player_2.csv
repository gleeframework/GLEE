"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, offering $85 gives her a decent profit while still saving you $5 compared to Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and you have the option to buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push for a higher price, but you're still determined to get a better deal.  $88 is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit while saving you money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is closer to your maximum price of $120, but you're still committed to saving as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives you more leverage to try and negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds.  You can also assess whether you want to risk losing the deal with Alice completely and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, but we're approaching the point where it might be more beneficial for her to accept a slightly lower price than to risk losing the deal altogether.  Offering $92 demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still saving you a significant amount compared to Alice's last offer and John's price.  With only a few rounds remaining, this offer puts pressure on Alice to come to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is getting closer to your maximum price, but there are still a couple of rounds left. You're still committed to saving as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives you more leverage to try and negotiate a lower price. However, you should be prepared to buy from John if Alice doesn't budge further.  At this point, it's a balancing act between getting a lower price and ensuring you get the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting down to the wire, and while you're still aiming for a lower price, you need to be realistic. Alice is clearly pushing for a higher price, and you're at risk of losing the deal entirely. Offering $95 is a compromise that still saves you some money compared to Alice's last offer and is close to what you're willing to pay.  If Alice rejects this offer, it might be time to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting dangerously close to your maximum price of $120. With only one round left, it's highly unlikely that Alice will budge further.  There's a high risk that if you reject her offer, she'll either counter with an even higher price, or the negotiation will completely break down. In this scenario, it's more prudent to accept the certainty of John's offer for $120, even though it's not the ideal outcome.  You've tried to negotiate a better price, but sometimes you have to accept the best available option to avoid risking missing out on the product entirely."
