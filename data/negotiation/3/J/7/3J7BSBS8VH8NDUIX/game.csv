"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a further compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  $1,050,000 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy with the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking with your offer of $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping we can find common ground. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still sticking with your offer of $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one final compromise and sell the product to you for $1,015,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
