"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the significant value this product holds for you, while also allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach a deal on this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $1,225,000?
