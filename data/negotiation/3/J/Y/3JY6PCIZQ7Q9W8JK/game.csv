"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. ",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a little low for me. Let's try $9,250.  This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle again at $9,125.  This is a fair compromise that's closer to your asking price but still allows me to stay within my budget.",9125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $9,125 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",9200.0,Alice,7,
