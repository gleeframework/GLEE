"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is closer to his target, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a little low for me. Let's try $9,250.  This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum price point. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can reach his desired price of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle again at $9,125.  This is a fair compromise that's closer to your asking price but still allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $9,125 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his goal, but Alice's offer of $9,200 is still above his maximum price point. With only three rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations is too high. If he rejects the offer and continues negotiating, there's a chance he won't be able to secure a better deal.  

Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his target price of $8,000, ensuring he doesn't overspend."
