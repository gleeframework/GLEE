"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is closer to her own valuation than mine. I have room to negotiate and try to get a better price.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit too high for my budget though.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $95 is still above my target price. I'll reject and offer something closer to my limit, hoping she'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To be honest, my absolute top price is $90.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is your top price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'd like to add a slight premium for the quality of the product. I can offer it to you for $92. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to my absolute maximum price.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and I'd rather secure the deal at $92 than risk losing it and having to buy from John for $100."
