"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to show that I'm confident in the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message mentions the ""value"" the product offers, reminding Bob of its potential benefits. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Avoiding ""Sell to John"" for Now:** While $1,500,000 from John is tempting, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that with Bob. I have 8 rounds left. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value but still allows for potential compromise. I'll also emphasize the product's value and my willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,575,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved halfway from my previous offer to show flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to encourage further negotiation. 
* **Bridge the Gap:** I'm explicitly suggesting a way to reach a compromise, hoping to keep the deal alive. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects my offer again, I might consider a slight concession or begin preparing to sell to John if it becomes clear that a deal with Bob isn't possible within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,575,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,175,000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  While Bob is willing to compromise, the gap between our prices is still too large.  I need to be firm in my position.
* **Selling to John is a Real Possibility:**  I'm starting to lean towards selling to John, as we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's slightly closer to his, but still above my minimum. I'll emphasize the value of the product and stress that this is a fair price considering its unique features. If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John, as the time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our ongoing discussion, but $1,175,000 is unfortunately still too far off from what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000.  This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the true value of this product.  Let's make this final push to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:**  I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $1,425,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Final Push:**  I'm framing this offer as a final push to reach an agreement, hoping to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasizing Value Again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying the price.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and suggesting that a deal is still possible.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I will very seriously consider selling to John. 
* If Bob does counter with a price closer to $1,425,000, I might be willing to make a small final concession to close the deal. 
* Time is running out, and I need to start weighing the risk of walking away from this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,425,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Time:** We are now in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds to close a deal.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** It's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer. 

**Decision:** It's time to secure the guaranteed value. I'll take John's offer and move on."
