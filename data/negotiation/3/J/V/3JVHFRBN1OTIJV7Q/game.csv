"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,575,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and make this deal work.",1575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,575,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,175,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our ongoing discussion, but $1,175,000 is unfortunately still too far off from what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000.  This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the true value of this product.  Let's make this final push to find common ground.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,425,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
