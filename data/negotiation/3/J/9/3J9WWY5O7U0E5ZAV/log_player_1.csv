Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. It's a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I don't make the offer an ultimatum. Instead, I invite Bob to consider the opportunity and provide his feedback. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential profit. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see potential in the product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let me know if that's a starting point we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point and still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Continue Negotiations:**  I can send Bob a counteroffer and explore if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Gain Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to hold out for a better price. 
* **Maintain Value:** Selling to John for $800,000 is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $750,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm prepared to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $900,000.
* **Value Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that encourages further negotiation (""Let's see if we can find common ground."")

This approach shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal while also ensuring I'm still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $825000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Future Value:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed option, there's a chance that Bob might see a higher value in the product than I initially estimated. By accepting his offer, I'm leaving open the possibility of the product exceeding its initial value.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks that I might not be able to secure a better price or that Bob might walk away entirely.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale close to my minimum. 

Given these factors, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and potentially benefit from the product's future value if Bob's assessment is accurate."
