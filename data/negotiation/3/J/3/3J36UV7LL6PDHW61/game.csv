"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
