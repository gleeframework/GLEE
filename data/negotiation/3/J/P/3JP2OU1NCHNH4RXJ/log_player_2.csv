"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget of $1,000,000, and he can get a better deal from John.  By rejecting, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and potentially get the price down."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum threshold of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
