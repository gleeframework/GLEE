Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us even closer to his maximum. 
* **Considering the Alternative:** We know John will buy it for $10,000, so our offer needs to be significantly better than that to be attractive to Bob."
