"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and represents a great value for your investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel that we might be able to find a better solution. How about considering $950,000 as a compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand your need to stay within your budget. However, $950,000 still falls below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to make one final concession -  let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  This would be a win-win situation, allowing me to move the product and you to acquire it at a competitive price.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your last offer and while I appreciate the effort, I believe we can still find a mutually beneficial solution. How about $960,000? This still allows you to make a profit while keeping the price within my budget.",960000.0,Bob,6,
