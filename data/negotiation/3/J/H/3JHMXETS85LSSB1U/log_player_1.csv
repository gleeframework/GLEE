Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels like a fairer starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  Could we settle at $700,000?  I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.
