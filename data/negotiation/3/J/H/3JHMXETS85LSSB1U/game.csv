"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels like a fairer starting point for us to negotiate from.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.  Could we settle at $700,000?  I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
