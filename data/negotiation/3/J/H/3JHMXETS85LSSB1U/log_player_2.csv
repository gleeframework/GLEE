# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering its value to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels like a fairer starting point for us to negotiate from."", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  

Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge much further:** She's already stated that $850,000 is her lowest. 
* **Time is a factor:** We're over halfway through the rounds, and further haggling might not yield significant savings.
* **John's price is a sure thing:** $800,000 is our target price, and we can get it right now without further negotiation. 

While there's a chance Alice *might* go a little lower, it's not worth the risk of losing out on John's offer entirely."
