"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500, which is $10,250. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
