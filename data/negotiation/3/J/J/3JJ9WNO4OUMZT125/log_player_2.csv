"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our unique product to you. This product holds significant value to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to buy from Alice, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price. John is offering a much better deal, and you can use that as leverage in your negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a great deal for both of us considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I am pleased to counteroffer at $875,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget, and you're already in a good negotiating position. It's likely that further counteroffers will only result in more back-and-forth, potentially leading to a stalemate.  Accepting her offer ensures a quick deal and a price that is within your desired range."
