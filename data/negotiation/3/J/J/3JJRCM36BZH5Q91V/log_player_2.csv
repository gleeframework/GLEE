"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start with a counteroffer that is closer to his ideal price of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's $10,000, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm on his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, but it is still $1,500 more than what he can get from John. Since Bob has the option of buying from John for a cheaper price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating for a lower price. There's a chance Alice might lower her price further to avoid losing the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference with Alice.  He's willing to pay a bit more than his ideal price, but still wants to keep it below $9,500.  $9,000 is a good compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is more than what Bob wants to pay, it's only $250 more than his ideal price and significantly less than what he'd pay for the product from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice, who may be unwilling to go lower. At this point, it's likely more advantageous to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
