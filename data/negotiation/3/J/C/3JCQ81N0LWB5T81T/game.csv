"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to an agreement that respects both our interests. How about we discuss a price closer to $800,000? I look forward to your response.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would be a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a good outcome.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your proposal. I've given it some thought and while I understand your position, I still feel that $800,000 would be a more reasonable price for both of us. It's significantly less than your original offer and closer to what I suggested earlier. I hope this helps move us towards a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Bob,4,
