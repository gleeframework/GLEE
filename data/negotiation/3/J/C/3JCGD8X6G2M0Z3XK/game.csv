"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $775,000. This is my best compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a ways off from what I had in mind.  Would you consider $700,000 for the product?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $750,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's the best price we can both agree on.",750000.0,Alice,5,
