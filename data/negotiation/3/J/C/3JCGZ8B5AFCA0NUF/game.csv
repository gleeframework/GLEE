"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This reflects the product's value while still being a good deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $12,200? This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us considering the value this product offers.",12200.0,Alice,5,
