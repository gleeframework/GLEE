"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1750000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is simply too low for me.  Given the product's worth to you, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This allows for a fair profit margin for me while still offering a significant value to you.  Let's make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me and the potential for a long-term partnership, I'm prepared to offer $1450000. This price is fair and allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my budget. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
