,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $105? That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still below what I can accept. How about we compromise at $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
