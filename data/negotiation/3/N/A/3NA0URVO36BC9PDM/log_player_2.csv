"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is a good price, but it's not the best possible price.**  You want to see if you can get it lower.
* **There's no harm in rejecting and making a counteroffer.** You have 10 rounds, so you have plenty of time to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is the worst-case scenario.**  You should only do that if you're convinced you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  A $50,000 reduction shows Alice you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  You don't want to start too low and risk alienating Alice. 
* **Stay within your budget:** This offer is still well within your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer:** This indicates she's willing to negotiate.
* **The price is within your budget and a good compromise:**  It's a solid deal compared to John's price.
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer in future rounds:**  Alice might get stubborn, and you risk ending up with John's higher price."
