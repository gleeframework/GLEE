"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $14000 is a good price for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $14000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14500. I'd be willing to go up to that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $16000.
