Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $119 leaves a small chance Bob might negotiate up slightly, but still ensures I get a price higher than John's offer if he accepts outright."
