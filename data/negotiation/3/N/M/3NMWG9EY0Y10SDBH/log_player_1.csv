Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $1600000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm aiming for a higher price, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,600,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose $1625000 as a compromise. This price allows us to stay within my budget while still providing a fair return for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm confident that further negotiation may not yield a much better result. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing it completely."
