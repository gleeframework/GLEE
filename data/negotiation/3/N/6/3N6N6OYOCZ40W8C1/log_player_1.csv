"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a high-quality product that's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a high starting price, but it allows for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $1,000,000 as possible.  I'll also be keeping an eye on John, who is a potential backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still a little hesitant about selling for $950,000, as it's just a bit below my minimum.  However, I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. There's still potential to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting close to my minimum, but it's still a bit below it, and I've already made a few compromises.  I'm running out of time, and selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum profit. It's time to secure the deal with John."
