"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to work together to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",980000.0,Bob,6,
