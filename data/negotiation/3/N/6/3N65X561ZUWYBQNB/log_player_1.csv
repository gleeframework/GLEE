"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and incrementally increasing his offer. Holding firm for one more round might push him closer to $18,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to be fair to the value of this product. My last offer is $19,000.  This is a great price for what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we're still above John's offer, Bob's increases have become smaller.  It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and we risk him walking away entirely. Accepting $17,000 secures a profit and avoids a potential loss if the deal falls through."
