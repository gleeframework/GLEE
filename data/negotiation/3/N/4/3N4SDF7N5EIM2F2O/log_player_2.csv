Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a compromise at $775,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $730,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you $760,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $760,000.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated the price down to $760,000, saving you $40,000 from John's offer and $90,000 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield much further reduction, and you risk Alice becoming less flexible.  
* **Reaching a Deal:** Accepting now secures the product for you at a favorable price. 

While there's a chance you could negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risks of losing the deal altogether."
