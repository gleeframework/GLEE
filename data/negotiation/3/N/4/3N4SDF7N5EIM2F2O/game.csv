"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $850,000. Let's see if we can work together to find a price that suits both our needs.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit high for me at the moment. I'm interested in purchasing this product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a compromise at $775,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle a bit lower. Would you be open to considering $730,000?",730000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $730,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you $760,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",760000.0,Alice,5,
