"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
