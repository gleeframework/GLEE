Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really committed to getting this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $105. That's as low as I can go.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105, and waiting any longer runs the risk of the price not improving significantly. It's a good deal compared to John's offer."
