Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I can still get a better price from Bob or potentially John. I need to see if I can push for a higher price before settling."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll see if I can counteroffer one more time and potentially push him to $1,100,000.  If that fails, I might need to consider selling to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached an impasse with Bob, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from him.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, John's offer is still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
