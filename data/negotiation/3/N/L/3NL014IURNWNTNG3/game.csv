"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you still get a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to go up to $1,080,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,080,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a small compromise on my end, but it's the best I can do at this point.  I think it's a fair offer for both of us.  What do you say?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
