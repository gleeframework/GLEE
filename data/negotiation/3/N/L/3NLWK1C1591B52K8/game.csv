"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'll make sure to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not quite comfortable with $115, Bob. I think we're getting close, though. How about we try $122? It's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay, but I think it's a fair compromise.",122.0,Alice,5,
