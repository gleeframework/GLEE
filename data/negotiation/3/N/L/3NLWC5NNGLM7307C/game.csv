"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we bring the price down significantly?  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Would you be open to a price of $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
