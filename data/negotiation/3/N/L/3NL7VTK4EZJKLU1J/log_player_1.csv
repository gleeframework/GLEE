Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I want to give Bob some space to feel like he's getting a good deal while still ensuring I make a decent profit.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John allows me to be more flexible with Bob. If he rejects my offer, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I have a better chance of getting a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is still an option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That gives you a good deal, and I'm still able to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not willing to go down to $9,000, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I emphasize that this price still represents a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to do it for $9,750? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Opportunity for a final counter:**  I want to see if I can push Bob just a little further before resorting to selling to John. 
* **John is the safety net:** I have a guaranteed $15,000 with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. $9,750 is very close, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** I'm making a final push to get a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Compromise and finality:**  The offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway again, and I'm framing it as a final offer to encourage acceptance.
* **John is still the backup:** I'm confident I can sell to John for a much better price, so I'm not overly concerned if Bob rejects this final offer."
