"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That gives you a good deal, and I'm still able to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to do it for $9,750? That seems like a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. $9,750 is very close, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
