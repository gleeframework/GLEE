"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to my target price and puts some pressure on Alice to move closer to my range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That gives you a good deal, and I'm still able to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me halfway, which is a good sign, but her offer is still $500 more than John's price. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate her down a bit further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly.  Would you be willing to do it for $9,750? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Negotiation:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments to signal my seriousness while still trying to save money.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for my counteroffer (""budget-friendly"") can make it seem more reasonable to Alice.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" reinforces the collaborative nature of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. $9,750 is very close, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now matched John's price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate as I won't get a better deal elsewhere. Accepting at $10,000 ensures I get the product at the best possible price."
