{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It shows you're willing to compromise but also that you value your product. 

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point, and you might need to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and how willing you are to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below your minimum valuation of $12,000, and you have a guaranteed sale to John for that price. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob to try to get a better price, but you are not in a rush to settle for less than your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is still quite a bit below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your minimum valuation. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price closer to $12,000. You have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so you have some leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $10,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
