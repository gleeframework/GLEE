"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150, it's still not the best deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer,  making it more attractive to Alice while still saving you a considerable amount of money.  It's likely to be accepted by Alice since she values the product at $100, but if not, you can continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer and is still closer to her desired price than your desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you still have some room to lower the price. You'll have to be strategic with your next counteroffer, but it's still more advantageous to continue trying to reach a better price than buying from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer and your previous offer.  It shows a willingness to compromise and potentially leads to a quick agreement. If Alice rejects this offer, it might signal that you should consider buying from John, as you may be close to her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still within your budget, and you're saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice is close to her bottom line. The risk of further negotiation is that she may not budge, and you could end up paying the full $150 to John.  Accepting the offer at $130 ensures a good deal and avoids the potential for a worse outcome."
