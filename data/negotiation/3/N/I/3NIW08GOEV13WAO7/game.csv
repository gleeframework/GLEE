"Alice, $2,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,700,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $2,300,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your position.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the value you'll gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer $1,800,000,  Let's see if we can close the gap.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
