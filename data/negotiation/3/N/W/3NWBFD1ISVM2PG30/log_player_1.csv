Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me some room for negotiation and potentially a higher sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is only $10 less than my initial offer, and it's still above my minimum price. Accepting his offer is the best option to ensure a quick sale and a good profit."
