**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $900,000. Her counteroffers are getting smaller, and she's emphasizing this is her lowest price.  Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, it's highly unlikely we'll secure a price significantly better than that with Alice. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
