{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $9,500 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** There's room for negotiation, and it allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By offering this price, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also not giving away the product for too cheap. This sets the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to sell for less than what the product is worth to me.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750?  That's a significant step from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a solid backup option in John. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to my target."
