"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we settle on $8500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price. Let's find a middle ground!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find that sweet spot!  $7750 is still a little low for me, but I'm open to continuing this conversation. How about we split the difference and go with $8125?  This would be a good compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal at this price.",8125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but $8125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $7900. Can we make it work at this price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
