{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the product's worth.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth seeing if you can squeeze out a little more.  You know Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's likely room for a counteroffer that benefits both of you.  A little negotiation could lead to a better outcome than settling for the minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. How about we split the difference at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While you could try to counteroffer again, the potential gains are small.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, especially since you have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John. It's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale at a price that's only slightly below your ideal."
