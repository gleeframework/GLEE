``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming high, but I'm also prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer, and adjust my strategy based on his response.  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum target of $1,000,000. I believe I can do better. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum price requirement.  While I'd ideally like to earn more, accepting this offer is the best option as it secures my desired minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown."
