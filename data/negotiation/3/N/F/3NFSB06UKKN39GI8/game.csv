"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair and reflects the value I see in it.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
