Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair and reflects the value I see in it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
