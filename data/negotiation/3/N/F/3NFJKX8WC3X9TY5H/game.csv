"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1000000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $900000. This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
