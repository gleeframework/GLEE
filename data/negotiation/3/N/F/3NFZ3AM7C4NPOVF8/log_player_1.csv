"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is above my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also setting a clear expectation of the value of this product.  We'll see how he reacts."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I still believe the product has higher potential value. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm countering with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. It shows Bob I'm willing to work with him, but I'm also not giving away too much."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. He's not budging much from his initial counteroffer, but I'm still hopeful I can get a bit closer to my desired price. I'll continue to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my offer to $1,300,000.  This is a slight concession, but I'm hoping it will encourage Bob to come up a bit. We're getting close to a potential agreement, and I want to keep the negotiation moving forward."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. It's the same as his first offer, and we're running out of time. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us, so I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not going any lower. If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation and we're still not close to a deal. I'm running out of time, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I need to secure a sale, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good amount of money and I'm guaranteed the sale."
