Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it allows for room to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. I'll also be keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I want to try to get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but still keeping it above John's offer.  This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just slightly above John's offer. Since my goal is to maximize profit, I'll accept this offer and sell the product to Bob.  There's little room for further negotiation, and accepting Bob's offer guarantees a higher sale price than John's."
