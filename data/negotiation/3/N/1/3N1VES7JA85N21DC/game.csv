,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fantastic deal for a product you'll value at $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,750 is getting close, but I need to be closer to $10,000. Would you consider $9,900? That's my final offer.",9900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but no more than that. Can you meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,6,
