Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It allows for some room to negotiate. 
* **The message:** It's positive and focuses on the value proposition while also leaving room for counteroffers. 

I'm aiming to strike a balance between getting a good price and ensuring the negotiation doesn't drag on too long, risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my limit and the value you've mentioned.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Moving to the Next Round:**  Rejecting allows me to counter-offer and try to push the price closer to my desired range.  I'm confident I can get a better deal without jeopardizing a sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $1,150,000 is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's budget limitations but still keeping the price closer to my desired range.
* **Message:** It emphasizes my willingness to negotiate while also highlighting the value of the product.
* **Moving Forward:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially lead to a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I can manage. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to move on to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Rejecting and Counter-Offering:**  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.
* **Selling to John:** This is the most advantageous option. John's offer guarantees a price that meets my minimum requirements.

**Conclusion:**  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price and avoid potentially losing the deal to another buyer."
