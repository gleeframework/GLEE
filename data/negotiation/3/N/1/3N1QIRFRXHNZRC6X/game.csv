"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my limit and the value you've mentioned.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I can manage. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to move on to another seller.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
