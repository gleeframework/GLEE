"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).**  
* **I have 9 rounds left.**  There's still time to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Selling to John now would guarantee $15,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price.** 

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $17,000 to $15,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protect my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I end with a question to keep the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  
* **We are getting closer to a potential deal.**  The gap between our prices is smaller now.
* **I have 6 rounds left.**  I'm confident I can continue negotiating with Bob to reach a price closer to my target.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop my price to $14,500.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($15,500) and Bob's latest offer ($14,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I remind Bob that the product is valuable and that this price is fair.
* **Positive Framing:** I use language like ""good compromise"" and ""good value"" to make the offer seem appealing. 
* **Keep the Negotiation Open:** I end with a question to invite Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).** While it's closer than before, I'm not willing to accept a price that significantly undervalues my product.
* **We are nearing the middle ground.** With only 4 rounds left, there's still a chance to negotiate a price closer to my ideal.
* **Selling to John now guarantees $15,000, but I want to explore if I can get even closer to my target price.** I'm hoping to reach a price above $14,500 before considering selling to John. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting close. While I appreciate your offer, $13,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,200. This price is a great deal considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's finalize this deal, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining My Ground:** I'm keeping my price higher than Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering it from $14,500. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** I emphasize that we're ""getting close"" and use phrases like ""finalizing the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I remind Bob about the value he'll get from the product, which justifies the price. 
* **Direct Question:** I end with a direct question to push Bob to respond. 

With only 3 rounds left, I'm aiming to close the deal with Bob while still maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but $14,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the last two rounds, and there's a high risk that Bob will keep lowering his offer, potentially pushing the price further away from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** It's unlikely that he'll come up to $15,000 in the next round.
* **John's offer guarantees $15,000.** This is a safe and secure way to ensure I get at least my minimum desired amount.

I'm choosing to sell to John. While I'd prefer to reach a deal with Bob, it's important to be realistic and choose the option that guarantees the best outcome for me."
