{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $120, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for that amount if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that leaves me significantly below my desired range. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $82 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
