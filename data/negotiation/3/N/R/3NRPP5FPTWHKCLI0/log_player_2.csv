"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** 

You are trying to save as much money as possible, so you should try to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to go lower than $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a good first step. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your intent to negotiate while still being within a reasonable range. This allows room for potential compromise and may encourage Alice to counter with a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within your budget and a good compromise.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk she might not go lower. Accepting her offer secures the product at a price you're comfortable with."
