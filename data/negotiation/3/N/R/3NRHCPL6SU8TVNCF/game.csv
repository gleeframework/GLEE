"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its unique features and the value it can bring to your life.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reviewing the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. After re-evaluating the product's value and considering your offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1025000. This is a price that I believe still reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $975000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. After re-evaluating the product's value and considering your offer, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1012500. This is a price that I believe still reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1012500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll also consider buying the product with a 5% deposit, which would bring the total price down to $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate the concession you're willing to make with the 5% deposit. However, I'm still not willing to accept $925000 as the final price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm proposing a counteroffer of $987500. This is a price that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to consider the 5% deposit to make it more attractive to you.",987500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the back-and-forth, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to accept the 5% deposit, so the total price would be $925000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",925000.0,Bob,10,
