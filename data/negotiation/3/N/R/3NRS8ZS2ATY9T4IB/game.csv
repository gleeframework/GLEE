"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I'm confident will bring significant returns. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $800000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.
