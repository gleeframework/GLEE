"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let it go that cheap. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think I can do better than that. How about we meet at $102? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.0,Alice,5,
