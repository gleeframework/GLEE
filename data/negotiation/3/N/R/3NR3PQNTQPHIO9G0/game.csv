"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more,  how about $10,500? This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
