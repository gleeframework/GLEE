Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and adjust my price to $875,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 875000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we agree on $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is inching closer to a more reasonable offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price and significantly less than his perceived value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to hold firm on a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal."",

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting much closer to my baseline, but I still have some negotiating room. I believe I can get him closer to $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $810,000. I believe this is a very fair offer considering the product's value."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $790,000. It's a strong offer, and I hope we can close the deal on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still under. His statement of a ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher. At this point, the potential gain from continuing negotiation is outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a favorable outcome."
