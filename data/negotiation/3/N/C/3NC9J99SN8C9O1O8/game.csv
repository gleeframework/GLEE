"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,000,000 is my absolute bottom line. This reflects the true value of the product, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
