Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It's above your minimum:** It ensures you earn more than your minimum value of $8,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you have room to negotiate a higher price. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your chances of getting the best price while leaving the door open for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it's still worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to formulate a counteroffer that is higher than $8,000 but still appealing enough to Bob. Consider factors like his budget and the value he places on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This counteroffer is above Bob's offer of $8,000, but still lower than your initial offer of $10,000. This shows that you're willing to negotiate but also value your product.
* **Reasonable for Bob:**  At $9,000, Bob is still getting a good deal compared to the value he places on the product.
* **Open to further negotiation:** By saying ""Let's find a price that works for both of us"", you leave the door open for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,250. This is my final offer, I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is significantly closer to your desired price than his previous offer and is significantly higher than what John is offering. 
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, suggesting further negotiation might be futile.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, you risk Bob walking away and leaving you with only John's offer of $8,000. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely. While it's not your ideal price, it's a good compromise and a profitable sale."
