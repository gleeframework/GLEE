It's always worth exploring options before settling.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, hoping to quickly get a good deal.  He's aiming for a 5% discount, hoping to find a compromise point with Alice."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still hoping to get a lower price. While $925,000 is closer to his goal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000}
```

Bob is trying to be more conservative this time. He's offering a slightly higher price than his previous counteroffer, but still hoping to land a deal closer to his target.  He's trying to find that sweet spot where Alice might feel pressured to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been consistently pushing for a lower price, and Alice has shown some willingness to compromise. At this point, accepting the offer of $920,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's closer to his target price than what John is offering, and it saves him $80,000.  While further negotiation is possible, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and Bob risks losing the deal."
