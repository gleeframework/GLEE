Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that's higher than his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than what John is offering, and this initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is still a price that's higher than his perceived value, but it's closer to what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm confident that we can find a middle ground, and this offer shows my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low and I'm not confident that further negotiation will get me closer to my desired price.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John."
