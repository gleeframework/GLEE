{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still leaving the option open to sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $10,000 and  below the value I believe the product holds. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly meet at $8,750? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, I've already lowered my price significantly.  I'm getting close to my minimum price, and John is still willing to buy the product for $10,000.  It's not ideal to have to settle for my minimum, but it's better than selling for less than I'm comfortable with. I'll go with John's offer to ensure I get the most out of this sale."
