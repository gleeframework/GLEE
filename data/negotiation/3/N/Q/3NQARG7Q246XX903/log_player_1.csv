"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone can help create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value for Bob can incentivize him to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider the following:

* **Lowering Price:** If necessary, I'll gradually lower the price, but I won't go below my minimum threshold ($1,500,000) without considering John's offer.
* **Counteroffers:** I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offers strategically, keeping in mind my minimum price and the remaining rounds. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'll constantly evaluate if John's offer is a better option than negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While his offer is too low, there is still room for negotiation. I believe I can secure a better price through further rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is attractive, I have 10 rounds to work with Bob.  I want to explore if I can achieve a higher price before committing to John. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price between Bob's offer and my minimum, aiming to find a compromise. 
* **Monitoring John:**  I will continue to keep John's offer in mind as I negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by using phrases like ""Let me know what you think.""

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's Response:** I will carefully evaluate Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price slightly depending on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to assess whether John's offer is a better option than negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** Bob's final offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Losing Value:** Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss of potential profit.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  While Bob claims it's his final offer, there's still a possibility for negotiation.  I can try to counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is appealing, I want to exhaust all options with Bob first.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise.
* **Emphasize Deadline:** I will  emphasize the limited number of rounds remaining to potentially incentivize Bob to accept a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** I will continue to monitor John's offer as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. With only five rounds left, we need to find a solution soon. This price is a significant compromise from my initial position, and it's the closest I can get to your offer. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's final offer, again demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Time Constraint:**  I'm highlighting the limited remaining rounds to create a sense of urgency and potentially incentivize Bob to consider my offer.
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that this offer represents a significant compromise from my initial position to show my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone and encouraging language like ""Let's close this deal"" to maintain a constructive atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's Response:**  I will carefully evaluate Bob's reaction to my counteroffer. 
* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I will adjust my price slightly depending on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds, but I will not go below my minimum price of $1,500,000 without considering John's offer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll continue to assess whether John's offer is a better option than negotiating with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  Bob's final offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only four rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price are diminishing.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a guaranteed profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:**  I will accept John's offer and close the deal, securing the highest possible price for my product."
