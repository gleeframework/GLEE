"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. With only five rounds left, we need to find a solution soon. This price is a significant compromise from my initial position, and it's the closest I can get to your offer. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
