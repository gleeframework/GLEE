Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible while still securing a profit. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Time value:**  While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, selling to Bob quickly might be more advantageous overall.

This offer aims to find a sweet spot that benefits both parties."
