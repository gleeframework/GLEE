"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  I'd be happy to consider purchasing the product for $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
