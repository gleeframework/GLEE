Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out.  Aiming for the high end of the profit zone is a good strategy.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:** Professional, emphasizing value and exclusivity.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 profit, which is a significant portion of the potential profit zone. 
* **Why this price?**  It gives Bob a strong incentive to buy ($50,000 savings compared to his perceived value) while still securing you a substantial return.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is an art.  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust within reason, but always keep your minimum price in mind."
