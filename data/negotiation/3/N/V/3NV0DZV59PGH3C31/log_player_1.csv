Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, giving him room to negotiate, but it's also lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving you room to negotiate as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling to John guarantees me the maximum value for the product."
