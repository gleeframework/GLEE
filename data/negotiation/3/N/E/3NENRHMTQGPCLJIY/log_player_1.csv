Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counters.
* **Justification:** While not giving away specifics, mentioning the product's ""significant value"" and ""unique"" nature attempts to justify the higher price. 
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the offer can make Bob more likely to consider it seriously. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher initially can potentially lead to a more profitable outcome."
