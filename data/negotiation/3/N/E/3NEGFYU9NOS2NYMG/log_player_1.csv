"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price. I'm also emphasizing the benefits for Bob to make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product,  $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it that low. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, it's getting close.  I've only got 6 rounds left, and the risk of not closing the deal with Bob and having to sell to John for less than my desired price is too high. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price and avoid potentially losing out on the sale altogether."
