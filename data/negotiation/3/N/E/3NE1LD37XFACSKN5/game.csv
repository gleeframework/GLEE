,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $9500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for us to meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price point.

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm appreciative of your continued effort to find a middle ground.  While $10800 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be. Let's split the difference again - how about $10400?  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product while still offering a profit for you.",10400.0,Bob,6,
