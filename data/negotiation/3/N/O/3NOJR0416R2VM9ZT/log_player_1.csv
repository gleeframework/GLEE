Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product is worth more in the broader market, justifying the high initial price.
* **Fallback Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, maximizing profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  This opens the door for a back-and-forth where I can gauge his willingness to pay and potentially settle at a price above $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** No loss. I proceed to sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
