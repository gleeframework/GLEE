"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000? This still represents a great value for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for you in the long run.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
