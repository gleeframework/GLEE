"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,225,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,225,000?  This price ensures a fair deal for both of us, and allows us to move forward.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,225,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,210,000, but no higher. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1210000.0,Bob,4,
