Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $110. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice has shown she's unwilling to meet my needs. It's unlikely she'll go below $110, and I can get the product for $100 from John. It makes more sense to stop negotiating and buy from John."
