"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for you and closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer of $10,500 for the product.
