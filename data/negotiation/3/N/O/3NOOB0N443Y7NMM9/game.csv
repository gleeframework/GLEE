"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $825,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the price John is willing to pay. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",800000.0,Alice,5,
