Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this deal work, I'm offering $1,050,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I've reviewed your latest offer carefully, and after considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations, I am willing to agree on a price of $1,050,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit while accommodating your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that will benefit both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is the best you've received so far and is within your budget. While you could potentially get it for $1,000,000 from John, the risk of losing the product to another buyer or Alice refusing to negotiate further makes accepting Alice's offer the most logical choice."
