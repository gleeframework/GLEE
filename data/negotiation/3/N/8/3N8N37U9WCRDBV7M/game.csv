"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $8,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my best price for now.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $10,500. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to do $9,250? That's a significant move on my end.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and my previous offer of $10,500, which is $9,875. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",9875.0,Alice,7,
