"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a slightly higher price to start.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's not a good deal to buy from Alice for $90 when John is selling it for $80.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $75 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $85?  That's still a fair price for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than what John is selling it for.  Let's try to get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to do $82?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 82}
