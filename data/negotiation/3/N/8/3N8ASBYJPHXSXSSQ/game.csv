"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a slightly higher price to start.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $75 for the product.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $85?  That's still a fair price for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to do $82?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction.",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,AcceptOffer
