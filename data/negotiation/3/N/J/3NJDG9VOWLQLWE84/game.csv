"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,
