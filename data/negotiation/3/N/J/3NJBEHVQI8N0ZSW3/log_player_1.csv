Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,500 as possible, as this is the highest price Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers (""list it publicly""), Alice motivates Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the phrasing ""What do you think?"" leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important:** This assumes Alice has no way of knowing for certain that John will buy the product for $12,000. If she was 100% certain, she could push for a higher price with Bob."
