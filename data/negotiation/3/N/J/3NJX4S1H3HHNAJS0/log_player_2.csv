"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above my target of $150. I'm willing to try and negotiate further with Alice to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing I'm serious about getting a good price. It's also below my maximum budget of $150, leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget and a good price considering my goal of saving as much as possible.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product at a reasonable price."
