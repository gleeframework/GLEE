"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  $9,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about $10,250? This way, we both come closer to our ideal price. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,250. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
