Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price is still above your minimum, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.

I'm thinking of adding a small warranty to the product, which will add some value to the buyer. In exchange, I'd like to sell the product to you for $1,120,000. This way, we can both benefit from the added value of the warranty."", ""product_price"": 1120000}"
