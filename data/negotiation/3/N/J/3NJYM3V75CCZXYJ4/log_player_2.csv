# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to be fair, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,175,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price is still above your minimum, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the deal. I'm thinking of adding a small warranty to the product, which will add some value to the buyer. In exchange, I'd like to sell the product to you for $1,120,000. This way, we can both benefit from the added value of the warranty. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to add a warranty to the deal, the price is closer to my target.  I'm willing to accept the offer as it's within my budget and still a better price than buying from John. The warranty could be a valuable addition to the product."
