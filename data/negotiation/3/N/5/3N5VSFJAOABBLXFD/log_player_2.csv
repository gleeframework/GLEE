**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you're aiming to save as much as possible. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to go down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $125. It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not quite where you want to be.  You can likely squeeze out a little more by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $117.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'll meet you halfway again and offer $127.50. It's still a great deal for this amazing product, and I think it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $127.5 is a decent price, it's getting close to your maximum budget of $150. It seems like Alice is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's more beneficial to just buy from John, who is offering a fixed price of $150. This guarantees you won't spend more than your limit, and it avoids further back-and-forth negotiation."
