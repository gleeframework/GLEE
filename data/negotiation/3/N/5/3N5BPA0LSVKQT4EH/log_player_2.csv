"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something you've been looking for and I know you'd appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Alice, meaning she's already making a profit by selling it to you for $140.
* **Your Value:** The product is worth $150 to you, so paying $140 is a good deal, but you can do even better.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to sell the product for $150, which is your maximum price.  

**Strategy:**  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or wait for a better offer. Since you have a backup option with John, you're not in a rush to accept the first offer."
