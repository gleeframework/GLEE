"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product,  $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's still a good price for a product worth $150, and it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on that.",130.0,Bob,4,
