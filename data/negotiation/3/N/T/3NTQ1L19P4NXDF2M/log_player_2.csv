"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is still above his target of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is within Bob's budget of $120 and is closer to his desired price than John's offer.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price while saving money."
