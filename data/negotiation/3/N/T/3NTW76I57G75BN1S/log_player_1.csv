Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This sets a high bar and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. It's unlikely he'll accept this first offer, but it's a good starting point. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I can either counteroffer or turn to John, who is my guaranteed backup at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By rejecting, I can counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price of $20,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I'm not yet willing to settle for $18,000, as I can still potentially achieve a better outcome through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $20,000 to $19,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. It shows that I am serious about making a deal while still maintaining a decent profit.
* **Testing Bob's Upper Limit:** This counteroffer will help me understand how much Bob is willing to pay and if there is room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $2,500 below my initial desired price and just $500 above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely and forcing me to settle for the $15,000 from John. 
* **Time is Money:** Accepting now ensures a quick sale and a reasonable profit.

Given the circumstances, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision.  It's a good compromise, and further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price or even a lost deal."
