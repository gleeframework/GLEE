Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $130 for it, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts by building rapport with Bob by suggesting the product is good for him. It then presents a price that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is more than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a great deal for you considering what it's worth, and it gives me a little more room to make this worthwhile for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
