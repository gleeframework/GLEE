"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. It's a compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be open to considering $78? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $81. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $81 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $79. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",79.0,Bob,6,
