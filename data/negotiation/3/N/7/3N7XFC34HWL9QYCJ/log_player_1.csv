Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you have some buffer to still make a great profit.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to your minimum ($10,000) leaves potential profit on the table. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring the sale and maximizing profit."
