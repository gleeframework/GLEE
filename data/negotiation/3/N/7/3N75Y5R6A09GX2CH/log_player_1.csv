{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. This price reflects its significant value and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired range.  I want to explore if Bob is willing to budge higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value to your company, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is getting closer to my desired range, it's still not high enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant concession from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to your business. Let's reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are not getting significantly closer to my desired price. While selling to John is not ideal, it's better than risking losing out on a sale completely and ending up with nothing."
