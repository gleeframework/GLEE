"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and your potential profit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to let it go for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my potential profit. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would allow you to make a good profit while still staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
