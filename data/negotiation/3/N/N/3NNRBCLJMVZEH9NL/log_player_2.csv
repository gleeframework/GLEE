# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to let it go for $1,050,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. You can still try to negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice is willing to compromise. You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,120,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,120,000 is still above your target of $1,000,000. While it is a good price, you have already established that John is willing to sell you the product for $1,000,000.  Since you are focused on saving as much money as possible, it makes more sense to purchase the product from John at this point."
