"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I believe it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to accept $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price within his budget. $130 is still a good deal for both parties, as it's above Alice's value of $120 and below Bob's maximum of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget concerns, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within Bob's budget and a fair compromise. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and the price might go back up. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and saves Bob money compared to buying from John."
