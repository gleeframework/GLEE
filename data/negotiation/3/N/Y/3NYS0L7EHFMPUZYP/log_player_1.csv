"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep my expenses covered. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $105. It's still within my budget and closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $120 I can get from John. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to $120. There are still 6 rounds left, so I have time to see if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would $110 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer $112.50, Bob's offer of $110 is very close. Since I only have 4 rounds left, it's becoming more risky to keep rejecting offers and risk losing the deal altogether. $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price and is a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $120, as I can potentially use the extra time to find another buyer later if I need to."
