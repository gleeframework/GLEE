"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and even higher than John's offer. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $100."
