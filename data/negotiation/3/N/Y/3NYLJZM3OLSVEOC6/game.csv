"I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe the product's value is worth more than your initial suggestion of $800000, and my counteroffer reflects that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm not willing to go above $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1100000, so I'll offer $975000. Can we meet at this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1050000. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go above $975000. I'll make one more concession and meet you at $1000000. Can we meet at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1075000. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go above $1050000. I'll make one last concession and meet you at $1050000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept $1050000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1075000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
