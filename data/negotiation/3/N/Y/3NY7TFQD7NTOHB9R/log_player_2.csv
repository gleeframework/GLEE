"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to go a bit further. How about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $90 saves you $30 compared to John's offer."
