"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair reflection of the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than your maximum budget ($1,200,000).
* However, you know you can get the product from John for $1,200,000. 
* There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, bringing you closer to her product's value of $800,000. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a better price."
