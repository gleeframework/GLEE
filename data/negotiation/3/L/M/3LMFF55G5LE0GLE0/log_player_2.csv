"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very attractive, but it's still too high.  I want to see if I can get a better deal.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still a bit high. I'm confident I can get it lower, and I'm not desperate to buy immediately.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $900,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $925,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price and we're getting closer to a deal.  While I'd prefer to go even lower, there's a risk she'll reject my next counteroffer, and we're getting close to the point where buying from John becomes the better option.  Accepting this offer gets me a good deal, and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
