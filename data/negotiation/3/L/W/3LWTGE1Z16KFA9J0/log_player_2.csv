"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the terms of the sale with you. Our initial offer is $900000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for much less than $1,200,000.  
* Alice's initial offer is high, leaving room for negotiation. 
* There are 10 rounds, providing ample time to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows your serious intent to negotiate and sets the stage for a more favorable price. 
* **Reasonable Range:**  $750,000 is still above Alice's value of $800,000, leaving room for both sides to compromise. 
* **Constructive Tone:** The message is polite and emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. Our counteroffer is $850000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but it's still higher than your ideal price. There's still room for both sides to come down a bit.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer shows Alice that you're not willing to settle for just any price and that you're determined to get a better deal. This keeps the pressure on Alice.
* **More Rounds Available:** You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is still a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right in the middle of our initial offers. I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** Offering $800,000 puts you directly in the middle of Alice's last offer ($850,000) and your previous offer ($750,000). This signals a genuine willingness to find common ground.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes fairness and the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. This helps build a more cooperative atmosphere.
* **Confidence and Closure:** The message conveys confidence in reaching a deal while also subtly encouraging Alice to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not quite ready to accept $800000. Our counteroffer is $825000 for the product. We're getting close, but we need to make sure we're getting a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Target:**  Alice's offer of $825,000 is very close to your desired price of $800,000.  
* **Time is Running Out:** You're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John for a significantly higher price.
* **Small Concession:** Accepting this offer represents a relatively small concession, and it's likely the best deal you'll get without risking a much higher price later on."
