"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to consider $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, hoping to get Alice to budge closer to his desired price.  $85 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This approach aims to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $102.50. This gives you a good price while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there are still rounds left to negotiate. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $102.50 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $90? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his budget. He's increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I still need to make a profit on this.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price of $80. With several rounds left, it's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down further. Bob can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $95 is closer, my budget is still tight.  Would you be willing to consider $92.50 as a final offer?  It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for a price closer to his budget while acknowledging Alice's need for a profit. He's offering a middle ground that's a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating that he's willing to compromise.  This could be his final offer before considering John's offer."
