"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fantastic deal, as you know the value to you is even higher. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,300,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could you do $1,225,000?  That would make this a done deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This offer reflects your value for the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal!",1275000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm offering you the product for $1,260,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1260000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can tell we both want to make this work. How about we settle at $1,250,000 and call it a deal?",1250000.0,Bob,8,
