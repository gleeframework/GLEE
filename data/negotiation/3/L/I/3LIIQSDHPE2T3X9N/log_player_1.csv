"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not ready to settle for $1,200,000 yet.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and will counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could you do $1,225,000?  That would make this a done deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping for a higher price.  $1,225,000 is getting closer, but I'll counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer, $1,240,000 is still a bit too low. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm offering you the product for $1,260,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1260000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I can tell we both want to make this work. How about we settle at $1,250,000 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, with only two rounds remaining, it's becoming more risky to keep rejecting offers. $1,250,000 is a good deal considering John is only offering $1,000,000. It's time to close the deal!"
