"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $105 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $98. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $98 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $101.50?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement on this.",101.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can offer $97.50 for the product. I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",97.5,Bob,6,
