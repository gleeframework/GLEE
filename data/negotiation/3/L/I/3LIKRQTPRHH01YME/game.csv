"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more money. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $110. This allows us to find a balance between our interests and ensures you still receive a good deal while allowing me to fairly compensate for the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $107.50. Would that be something you'd be willing to consider?",107.5,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $109. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to consider this price?",108.0,Bob,6,
