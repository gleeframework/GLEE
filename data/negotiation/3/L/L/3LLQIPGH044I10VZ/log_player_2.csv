Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I can sell the product to you for $105.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $105, and it's not worth risking getting a worse deal. Buying from John for $100 guarantees the best price."
