{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than John's, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $14,000. I will counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,250 is closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $12,800. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a price closer to $14,000, Bob's offer of $12,800 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and is a decent compromise.  It's also a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him. Accepting this offer will allow me to move forward with the sale and secure a profit."
