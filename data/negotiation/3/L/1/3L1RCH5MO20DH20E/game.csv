"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product; however, I believe your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $650,000. Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I can see us reaching a deal closer to $750,000. Would you be open to that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
