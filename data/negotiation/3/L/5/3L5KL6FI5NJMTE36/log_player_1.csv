Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. 

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a higher price with Bob, I've reached a point where I'm concerned that the negotiation might go on for too long and I'll lose out on valuable time. It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to risk a lower offer or further delays."
