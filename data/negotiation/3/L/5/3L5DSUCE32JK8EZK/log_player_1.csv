Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $13,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $13,500, you anchor the negotiation around a higher value, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's worth. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows you to potentially decrease the price during counteroffers, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's closer to your target, you have the option to negotiate further as you have a standing offer from John. By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're looking for a higher price and are willing to walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept anything below $12,000 for the product. It's a high-quality item, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Decrease the Price:** This shows Bob you're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of a significant loss.
* **Justify the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, you're reminding Bob of its worth and why your price is justified.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive while still aiming for a price that's comfortably above your minimum. 

You're moving closer to John's offer, so be prepared to make a decision if Bob's next offer is still too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that:

* **Bob might walk away:** He's already shown some price sensitivity.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:** You have a guaranteed offer from John. 

Accepting $10,500 gives you a profit and avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation."
