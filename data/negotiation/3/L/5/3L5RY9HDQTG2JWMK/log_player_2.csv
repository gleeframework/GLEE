Round 7

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is good:** $1,025,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **Alice is firm:**  She's clearly signaled this is her bottom line with the ""one more concession"" and ""as low as I can go"" statements.
* **Limited rounds:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation window. Continuing to push could make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price. 

This deal gets you the product well below your maximum budget."
