"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $125. It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $125, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $127. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",127.0,Alice,5,
