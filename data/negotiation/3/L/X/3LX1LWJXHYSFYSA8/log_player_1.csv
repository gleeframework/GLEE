"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to leave room for negotiation and still get a good price. I'm also trying to establish a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept a price that undervalues the product for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll get your money's worth. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I believe I can get a better price, especially considering I have more rounds to negotiate. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John for $12,000 open, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,250 is a good offer, I'm still holding firm at $9,400. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. It's just a small gap now, let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I'm close to reaching a deal with Bob, the negotiation process is taking too long.  The risk of further rounds with Bob is that he might continue to offer lower prices, putting me in a position where I might have to settle for less than my minimum value. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further risk."
