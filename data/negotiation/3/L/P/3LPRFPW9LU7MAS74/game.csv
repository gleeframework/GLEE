"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm getting close to my target, and I'm hoping we can meet soon.",9800.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $9,800 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant compromise. This would allow us to both walk away with a fair outcome. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I'm not willing to go above $9,800. I'd like to make a final offer of $9,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit. However, $9,500 still isn't feasible for me.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best way to finalize this deal.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $9,700, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9700.0,Bob,8,,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,700 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,900 as a final compromise.  This price represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John.  Let's make this happen.",9900.0,Alice,9,,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to close the deal, but I'm still not willing to pay $9,900. I'm willing to meet you at $9,600, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to buy the product from John for $8,000.",9600.0,Bob,10,,
