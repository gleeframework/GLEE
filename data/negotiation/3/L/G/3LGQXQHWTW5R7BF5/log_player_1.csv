"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I can lower the price in subsequent rounds if needed.
* **Alternative:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $800000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is exactly my floor price, but I'm not desperate to sell immediately. 
* **Negotiation:** I have 9 rounds left and want to see if I can get a higher price. 
* **Counteroffer:** I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap. 
* **No Rush:** I'm confident I can get a better price, and John is a good backup if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe the product's true value is closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850,000? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Value Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Attractive Offer:** $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, especially if he values the product highly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $825000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Floor:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John would be safe, it's only $25,000 less than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Further negotiation might drag on, and I'm not sure we'll reach a significantly better price.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer as it's a good deal considering the remaining time and my alternative option."
