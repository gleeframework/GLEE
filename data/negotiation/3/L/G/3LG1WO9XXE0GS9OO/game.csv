"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still be a significant saving compared to what you value the product at.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that considers your value and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
