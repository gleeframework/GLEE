Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, there's a chance Bob might accept that price.  It's the highest you can realistically aim for.
* **Avoid Lowballing:** Starting too low (e.g., $8,500) might offend Bob or make him think the product is flawed. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the potential delay of going to John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have time to negotiate with Bob. If you have more time, you could start higher and see if he's willing to negotiate."
