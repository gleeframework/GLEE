"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to move from my initial price, but we need to find a number that makes sense for both of us. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable number. It seems like we both recognize the value here. To find a solution we can both agree on, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for me.  I'm going to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $1,200,000 is simply too far from where we need to be.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,550,000.  However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have another buyer ready to close at my asking price.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need you to meet me closer to this number for that to happen.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
