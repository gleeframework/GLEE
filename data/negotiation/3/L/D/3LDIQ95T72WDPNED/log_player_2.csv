# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $975,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?
