"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. ",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer! How about we split the difference and settle on $100? That way, I can still make a fair profit, and you get the product for a price that works for you.",100.0,Alice,5,
