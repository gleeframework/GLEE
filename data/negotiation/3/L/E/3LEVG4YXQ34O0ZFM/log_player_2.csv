"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100.  It's always best to start by rejecting the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This creates room for negotiation and shows that you're serious about buying the product, but are also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You have options to try and negotiate further, and you haven't exhausted all rounds yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show you're willing to negotiate but are firm in your budget. It offers a price in the middle of your previous offer and Alice's offer, signaling your desire for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer! How about we split the difference and settle on $100? That way, I can still make a fair profit, and you get the product for a price that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget of $100.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer gets you the product at your target price."
