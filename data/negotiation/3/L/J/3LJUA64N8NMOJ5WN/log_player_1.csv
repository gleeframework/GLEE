{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My price is $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me some profit.  I'm also trying to establish a positive tone and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell it for that price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm dropping the price a bit, but not too much. I'm still aiming to get a decent profit, and I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $80. That's a fair price, and I'm eager to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, the risk of going lower and lower is too great.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I'm confident I can get a better price with him."
