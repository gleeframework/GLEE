"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My price is $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($60), I'm aiming to create room for negotiation and signal my budget limitations. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a polite and interested tone is crucial to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation instead of walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's offer of $100 is better, it's still significantly higher than my $80 budget and the $80 John offers. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate and try to get the price closer to my target. I'm willing to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $80. That's a fair price, and I'm eager to get this deal done."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:**  I'm being more direct this time, clearly stating my desired price ($80) and framing it as a fair compromise.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I'm adding a touch of time pressure by expressing eagerness to ""get this deal done."" This might encourage Alice to make a decision. 
* **Backup Option:** I have John's offer as a backup, so I'm not desperate. This gives me leverage to stand firm on my $80 offer."
