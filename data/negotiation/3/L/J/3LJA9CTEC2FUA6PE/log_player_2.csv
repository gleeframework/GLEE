"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a wise investment. Let me know if you'd like to proceed.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, there is no benefit to accepting her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer keeps your options open and doesn't cost you anything."
