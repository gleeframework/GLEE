"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that is fair to both of us. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though Alice is trying to be vague about the ""fair price,"" her actual offer of $10,000 is still lower than what you'd pay John.
* **You save money.**  By accepting Alice's offer, you save $2,000 compared to buying from John."
