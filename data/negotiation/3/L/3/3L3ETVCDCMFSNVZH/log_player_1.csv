Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  $900,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility, but I still aim for a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I will counteroffer again."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground between our desired prices. This should hopefully encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

It's getting close, but Bob's offer is still too low for me. I've already gone down significantly from my initial asking price. While I want to close the deal, I also want to be profitable.  John offers a secure and fair price, so I will sell the product to him."
