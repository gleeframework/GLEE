**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $10,000.  While we might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of her, it's not worth the risk of her digging in her heels. We have a guaranteed option with John at $10,000, so it's best to take the sure thing and save the time/hassle of further negotiation."
