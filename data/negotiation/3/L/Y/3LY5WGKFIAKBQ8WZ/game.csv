"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value it holds for your business. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
