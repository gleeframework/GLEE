"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10500. This price still gives you a great value, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9500? I think that's a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you - $9500 is closer to what you're hoping for. I'm still aiming for a bit more, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. Let's try $10000.  It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9250, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I understand you're sticking to your $9250 offer. To show you I'm serious about a deal, I'm willing to come down to $9750. This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9375? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9375.0,Bob,8,
