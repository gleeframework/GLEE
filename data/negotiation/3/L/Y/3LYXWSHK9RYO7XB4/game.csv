"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
