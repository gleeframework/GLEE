"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little too steep for me.  Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it at this level. Let me know if you're interested!",8500.0,Alice,5,
