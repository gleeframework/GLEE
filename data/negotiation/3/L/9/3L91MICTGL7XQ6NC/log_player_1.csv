"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also highlighting the potential value to Bob in my message, hoping to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push the price up a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $12,500? That's a fair compromise and would ensure we both walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,800 is very close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer one more time to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  I'm willing to come down to $12,200. This is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying the product, I encourage you to consider this price. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 12200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $12200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11900 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and while Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's not quite there.  I've already made several concessions, and there's a risk of going back and forth for the remaining rounds without reaching a deal. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's safer to sell to him and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
