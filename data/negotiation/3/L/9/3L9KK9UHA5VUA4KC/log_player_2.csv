**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the same as John's price.** There's no benefit to rejecting Alice's offer since you'll end up paying the same amount to John. 
* **You're trying to save money, but there's no opportunity to do so in this scenario.**  
* **The wording of Alice's message is irrelevant** to the decision as it doesn't influence the actual price."
