,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product, given its value to me.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I think the product's value is higher than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $160 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to offer $130, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $145, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value. It's a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $130. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $140. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. Let's meet at $137.50. It's a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",137.5,Alice,7,
