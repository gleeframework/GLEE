{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** Bob values it at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price below the potential value to Bob, you signal your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

If Bob rejects, you'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. It's better to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still give you a great price, and it's fair for me as well."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still being above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  By highlighting that this price still gives him a good deal, it emphasizes the value proposition for him.
* **Staying firm on value:**  Offering $12,500 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not drastically reduce my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $12500. How about we meet at $11500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to accept a price that would result in a loss for me.  It's better to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  This will show Bob that I'm still serious about getting a fair price for the product.  I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Since we're both trying to find a middle ground, how about $11,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** This counteroffer shows a small concession from my previous offer but remains above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizes Fair Price:**  By stating that this price is ""fair for both of us,"" it encourages Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.
* **Finality:** Stating that we can ""finalize the deal"" if he accepts implies a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit above $11750. How about we meet at $11500? I'm willing to pay that, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware of my backup option with John. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems determined to push for a lower price.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price."
