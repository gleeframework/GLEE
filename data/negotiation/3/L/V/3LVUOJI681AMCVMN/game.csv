"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we compromise at $10,000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  However, $10,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,800? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9800.0,Alice,7,
