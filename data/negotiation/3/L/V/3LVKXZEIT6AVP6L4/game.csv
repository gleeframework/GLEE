"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high at $11,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're still trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,500. How about we meet at $10,800? This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",10800.0,Alice,5,
