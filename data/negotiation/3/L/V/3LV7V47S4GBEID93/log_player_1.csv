"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 
 
This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation by showing I value Bob's time and am willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to find a more favorable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To make this easy, I'm willing to offer $10,000 even. This saves us both time and gets the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is right at his perceived value of the product, which is acceptable to me given that I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting this offer is the best option at this point, as I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob, and selling to John at $12,000 is not guaranteed."
