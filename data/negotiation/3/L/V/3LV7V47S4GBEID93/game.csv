"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? That's a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To make this easy, I'm willing to offer $10,000 even. This saves us both time and gets the deal done.",10000.0,Bob,6,
