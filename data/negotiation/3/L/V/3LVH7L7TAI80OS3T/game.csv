"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1075000, which reflects a significant discount from my original offer.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1075000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1025000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1025000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1050000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
