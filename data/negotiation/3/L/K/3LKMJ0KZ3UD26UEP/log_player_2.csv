Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500.

What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're feeling pressure to move forward, but I'm still not willing to sell at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. What do you think?
