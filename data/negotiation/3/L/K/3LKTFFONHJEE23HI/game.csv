"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this price is more in line with the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $7,000? It's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $8,250 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",8250.0,Alice,5,
