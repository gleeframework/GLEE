Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this price is more in line with the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $8,250 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings rather than risk Alice not budging further."
