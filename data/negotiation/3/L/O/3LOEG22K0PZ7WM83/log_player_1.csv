Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price as close to $1,499,999 as possible without alienating Bob. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:**  Begin with a price above Bob's perceived value to give yourself room to negotiate.
2. **Justify the Price:**  Provide reasons why your product is worth the asking price (its unique features, benefits, market value, etc.).
3. **Gauge Bob's Reaction:**  Pay close attention to Bob's response to see how much negotiating room you have.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its exceptional [mention key features and benefits], I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,450,000 is above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation and is significantly below your guaranteed offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  You signal a willingness to negotiate, which encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower. 
* **Your Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a less aggressive starting price might be better.
