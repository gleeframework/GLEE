"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still aiming for a profit. This should demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while also holding firm on my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $115 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum, and further negotiation might take too much time.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale within the allotted rounds."
