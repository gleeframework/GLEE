Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

Bob is now pushing his counteroffer to the upper limit of his budget, recognizing that time is running out. This offer is a serious attempt to close the deal, but it's still $200,000 less than Alice's previous offer.  If Alice rejects, Bob is prepared to buy from John at his higher price, but wants to exhaust all options with Alice first."
