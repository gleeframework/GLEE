I'm starting with my maximum value because I know I can always sell to John for that amount. This sets a clear expectation and might encourage Bob to be more competitive with his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also sets a firm lower limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price and represents a better deal than selling to John. It's worth accepting this offer and securing the sale."
