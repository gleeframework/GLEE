Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything less than $1,200,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

While we could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,100,000 is a strong outcome. It's a significant profit above Bob's perceived value and avoids the risk of him walking away or further negotiation rounds."
