"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a significant value, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $12000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500? This would still give you a great deal while allowing me to fairly compensate for its unique qualities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm not willing to pay that much. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to go up to $13,500. I'll offer $12,500.

{""message"": ""I understand you want to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still a bit concerned about the cost. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
