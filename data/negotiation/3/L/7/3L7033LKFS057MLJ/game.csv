"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get closer to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
