Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're making a genuine effort to reach an agreement, Bob. I appreciate that. In light of our discussion, I'm willing to offer the product at $7,125. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise.

``` 

Alice is clearly trying to inch the price up bit by bit.  While we could probably get the price down a little more, it's unlikely to be a significant amount. Accepting at $7,125 saves us money compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiations failing."
