"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than $120 to you, given its quality and benefits. Let's discuss a fair price that reflects its true value. My initial offer is $140.",140.0,Alice,1,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the product's value and your budget, I think $115 would be a fair compromise. It's slightly above your offer but still below the original asking price. Let me know if this works for you.",115.0,Alice,5,
