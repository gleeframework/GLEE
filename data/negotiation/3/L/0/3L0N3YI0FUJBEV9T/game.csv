"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $150? It's a very fair price for this product.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",135.0,Bob,4,
