"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can do better than $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price that's closer to your ideal price point, but still leaves room for Alice to come up a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is still more than your ideal price, but it's a good compromise, especially since there's no guarantee Alice will accept your next counteroffer. Buying from John will cost you the same as accepting Alice's offer, so it makes sense to take the deal and move on."
