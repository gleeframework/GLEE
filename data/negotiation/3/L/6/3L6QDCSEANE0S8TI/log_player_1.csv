"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's well above my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob has a chance to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise that hopefully will be appealing to Bob while still being a good price for me."
