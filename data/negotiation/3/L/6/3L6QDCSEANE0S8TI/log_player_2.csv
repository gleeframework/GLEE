"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to negotiate and try to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still below Bob's maximum price of $12,000 and closer to his desired price. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of going through more rounds increases the chance of Alice getting closer to her asking price or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is favorable to Bob."
