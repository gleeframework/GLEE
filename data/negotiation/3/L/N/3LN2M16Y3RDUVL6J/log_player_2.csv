"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I will reject the offer. The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so she can't expect to get $11,500 from me. I will wait for a better offer or buy it from John for $12,000.
