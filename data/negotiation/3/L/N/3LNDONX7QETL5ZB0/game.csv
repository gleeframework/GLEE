"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,100 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",9200.0,Alice,7,
