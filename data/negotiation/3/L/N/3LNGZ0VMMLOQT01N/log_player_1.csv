Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $140 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($100), but it leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a reasonable deal. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.
* **Alternative Option:** By having John as a backup buyer, I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. This strengthens my negotiating position."
