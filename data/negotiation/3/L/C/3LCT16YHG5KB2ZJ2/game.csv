"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would make sense.  What do you say?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $725,000 is a good offer, but it's still a bit lower than what I need.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $775,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",775000.0,Alice,5,
