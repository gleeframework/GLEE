{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its true value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I've also included a message that highlights the value of the product to Bob, potentially making him more willing to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would make sense.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm open to negotiation,  his offer is too low at this point. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
