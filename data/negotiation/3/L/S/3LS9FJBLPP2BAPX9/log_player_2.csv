{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $30 above your maximum price. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price of $100. This is the price I'm willing to pay and still get value from the product.  While I'm open to negotiation, I want to make it clear that this is my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $25 above my maximum price.  I'm not yet willing to pay that much.  I will try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $105. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise. However, I'm still keeping it below my maximum price of $100 to maintain some negotiation leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $120, that's still $20 over my maximum price.  I've made a counteroffer and been rejected twice.  At this point, it's clear that I'm unlikely to get a better deal from Alice.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed $100 offer."
