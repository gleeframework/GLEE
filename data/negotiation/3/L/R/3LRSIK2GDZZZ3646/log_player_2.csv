"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1000000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept her initial offer. You have 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its worth to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1175000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can still get the product from John for a lower price, so it makes sense to reject her offer and continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You're still able to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. You have 5 rounds left."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,100,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $1,120,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have 3 rounds left to try and negotiate further. It's still worth pushing to get a better deal, as you can always go to John for $1,000,000."

Even though Alice is getting very close to your target price, it's still worth pushing for a better deal. You only have one round left, and you can always fall back to John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's a good chance Alice will accept your counteroffer in the final round, especially since she's already dropped the price significantly."
