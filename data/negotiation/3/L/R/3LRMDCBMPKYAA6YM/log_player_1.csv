I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm aiming for a compromise. My counteroffer is still higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my original asking price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages further negotiation."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. It's more than what John is offering, and I'm willing to take the deal."
