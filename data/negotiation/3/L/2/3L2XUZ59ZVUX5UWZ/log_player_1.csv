"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $170.  While I know the product is worth $80 to Bob, I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum value of $150.  It's important to leave room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $140. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of time, $110 is still below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer in the next round. I need to consider the possibility of selling to John if this round doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but still a bit higher than his last counteroffer. I'm hoping to close the deal this round, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting too low.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not going to take a big loss.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
