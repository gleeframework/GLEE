"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 is considerably below what I can accept. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer and propose a price of $1,025,000. This reflects my best effort to find a compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the fact that I could purchase it elsewhere for $800,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge your perspective, $900,000 remains significantly below its true worth.  I'm open to finding a solution that benefits us both. To that end, I propose a price of $980,000.  This represents a considerable compromise on my end.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm pleased to see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $980,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product, which reflects a compromise from both of us. Let's try to reach a final agreement at this point.",950000.0,Bob,6,
