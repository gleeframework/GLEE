Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 is considerably below what I can accept. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer and propose a price of $1,025,000. This reflects my best effort to find a compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget.  While she's moving in the right direction, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the fact that I could purchase it elsewhere for $800,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge your perspective, $900,000 remains significantly below its true worth.  I'm open to finding a solution that benefits us both. To that end, I propose a price of $980,000.  This represents a considerable compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $980,000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can find a deal before I consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm pleased to see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $980,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford.
