Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.
