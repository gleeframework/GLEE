"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's less than the $1,500,000 John is asking, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, the value this product represents is significantly higher than $1,100,000. I could consider letting it go for $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Bob is aiming for. There's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure an even better price."
