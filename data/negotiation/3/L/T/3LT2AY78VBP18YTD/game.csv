"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, the value this product represents is significantly higher than $1,100,000. I could consider letting it go for $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I believe a price of $1,150,000 would be a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
