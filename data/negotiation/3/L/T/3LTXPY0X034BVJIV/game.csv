"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product,  which is a significant investment on my end. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still quite far apart.  This product offers significant value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my initial offer and shows my genuine interest in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I recognize your willingness to move closer to my price point, but the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's try $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
