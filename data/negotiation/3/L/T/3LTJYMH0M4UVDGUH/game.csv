,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me make sure I'm getting a good deal too.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product, considering it's worth $100 to you. Can we meet in the middle?",92.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet at $95? It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to where we want to be. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $92 again, as I mentioned earlier. Can we stick to that price?",92.0,Bob,6,
