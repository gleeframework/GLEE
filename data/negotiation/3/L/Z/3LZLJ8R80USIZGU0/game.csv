"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase price closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, however, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider a price of $1,350,000.  This offer takes into account the product's worth while still providing you significant value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. To be realistic, I could go up to $900,000. This offer reflects a fair price that considers both the product's value and my own financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant.  To show you I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. However,  $1,275,000 is just beyond what I can justify. To be completely transparent, the absolute most I can offer is $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal given market conditions and the product's value. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
