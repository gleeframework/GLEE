"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $850,000? I think that's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my initial offer. How about we try $825,000? I think that's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $812,500. I'm still a bit short on my initial offer, and I need to stay closer to that. How about we try $820,000? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $820,000 mark.  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and we risk pushing Alice away. Accepting at $820,000 secures a reasonable deal."
