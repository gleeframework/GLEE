"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 is the best option."
