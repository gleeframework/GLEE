Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob. I can meet you at $12500, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's meet in the middle at $12750. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  

Here's why:

* **The deal is close, but not there:** While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, she's still not willing to go below $12,500. 
* **Time is running out:** Bob only has 3 rounds left. It's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a better deal in that time, especially since Alice seems firm on her price.
* **John is a sure thing:** John offers the product at Bob's maximum price, making him the safer option.

By buying from John, Bob ensures he gets the product at his maximum price point without risking further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
