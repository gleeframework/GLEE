Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $13,500. This is still significantly more than Bob's initial offer, but shows a willingness to negotiate and hopefully motivates him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum, and I'm willing to accept it.  I'd rather make the sale now than risk another round of negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for my absolute minimum."
