"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 145} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120), but below my minimum ($150). This allows for negotiation room while maximizing my potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition of the product, aiming to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a high offer to test the waters and gauge Bob's willingness to pay. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open, ensuring I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120.  Would you be willing to come down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I believe there's room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm opting to make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to $140, hoping to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm aware of the risk of losing Bob altogether if I continue to push for a higher price. However, with several rounds remaining, I believe I have time to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  The option of selling to John for $150 remains a valuable safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $135? That's still a good price for this product, and it's closer to your offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $135, a compromise between my previous offer of $145 and Bob's counteroffer of $130. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective and highlighting the value proposition of the product. I'm trying to build rapport and encourage him to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. By offering $135, I'm hoping to find a middle ground and move closer to a deal.
* **Negotiation Timeline:** With only 7 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  I'm willing to concede slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit.
* **John as a Backup:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. How about $132? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acceptance:** I'm accepting Bob's offer of $132. While it's still below my initial desired price, it's only $3 away from my minimum acceptable price of $129, and the negotiation process has taken several rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing Bob, as well as the possibility of not getting a better offer in the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Deal:** I'm prioritizing closing the deal to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John. 
* **Time Management:** With only 6 rounds left, I believe it's prudent to accept a slightly lower offer and move on.
* **Future Negotiations:**  I can use this experience to improve my negotiation skills for future deals."
