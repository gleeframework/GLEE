Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below the value I initially placed on the product.  I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering $100, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still want a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is only $5 more than selling to John, it's still a better deal.  It's unlikely I'll get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely."
