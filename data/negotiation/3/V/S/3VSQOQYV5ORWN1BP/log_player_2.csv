"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is as close to his $10,000 limit as possible, but still offers Alice some profit. $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to stay within his $10,000 budget. While $11,000 is closer, it's still not acceptable.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,750?  This would allow me to make the purchase and still stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to negotiate a price that is as close to his $10,000 limit as possible, while still offering Alice a reasonable profit.  $10,750 is a compromise, and Bob is signaling that he is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm very close to my budget, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10,800. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget with this offer.  $10,800 is a compromise that shows his seriousness about buying the product while still leaving some room for Alice to profit. This is likely to be Bob's last offer before considering John's deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,800 is getting close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up on the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $10,950. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his budget, but Alice's final offer of $10,950 is still outside of his $10,000 limit.  While he has one more round to negotiate,  the risk of Alice refusing another counteroffer is high.  Since John is offering the product for $10,000,  Bob should take the safer option and buy from John to ensure he stays within his budget."
