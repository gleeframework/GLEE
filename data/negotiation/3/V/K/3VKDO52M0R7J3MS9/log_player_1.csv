``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above your minimum but leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob.  It also conveys a positive, confident tone while clearly stating your asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is a good price, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and also higher than selling to John.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm willing to accept it."
