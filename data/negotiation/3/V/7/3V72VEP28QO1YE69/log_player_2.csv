You can do better than $110.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to get a lower price."

$108 is a good price for you, and you are likely to get a better deal if you keep negotiating, but there is no guarantee. You could risk Alice walking away, and you will have to buy the product from John for $120."
