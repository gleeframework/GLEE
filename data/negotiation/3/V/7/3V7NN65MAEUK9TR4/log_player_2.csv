"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is of significant value to you, for a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. Let's discuss a price point that works for both of us. I'm confident we can find a solution that's a win-win. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than both her valuation ($800,000) and your backup option with John ($1,200,000). By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price, increasing the chances of getting a lower offer in the future."
