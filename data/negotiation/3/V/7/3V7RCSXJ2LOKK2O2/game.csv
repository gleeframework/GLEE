"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit outside my budget though.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $100?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product at a reasonable profit.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  To be honest, $80 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works for you, I'm ready to buy right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
