"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $90?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $95. I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more offer. I can do $98, which is a bit above your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
