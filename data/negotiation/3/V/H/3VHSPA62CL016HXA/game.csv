"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825,000 is still a little bit of a stretch for me right now.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of this product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $800,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,5,
