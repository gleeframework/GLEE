"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $15000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. How about $14250? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to move forward.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13500 and $14250, so how about $13875?",13875.0,Bob,6,
