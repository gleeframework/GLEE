"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17000 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $14000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $15500?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still being a great price for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
