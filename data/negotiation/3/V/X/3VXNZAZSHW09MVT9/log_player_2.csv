"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's room for negotiation to try and get a price closer to Alice's value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we aim to understand her lower bound and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship while still clearly stating our price target.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $70 is below Alice's value but still a potential profit for her. This gives her an incentive to counteroffer rather than walk away immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her value, but there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming for a price closer to $80, and accepting $85 would leave potential savings on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $77, we're splitting the difference between our previous offer ($70) and Alice's counteroffer ($85). This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Moving Closer to Target:**  This offer is getting very close to Alice's likely value of $80, increasing the chances of her accepting.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While we're willing to compromise, we're still aiming to get the best possible price and not conceding too much too quickly."
