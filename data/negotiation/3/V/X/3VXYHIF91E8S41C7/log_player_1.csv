"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above what Bob considers the product worth but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the ""value"" the product brings, which might make Bob reconsider his initial assessment.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I can create a sense of urgency for Bob to negotiate. This also helps maximize my potential earnings. I'm confident that if Bob rejects this initial offer, we can still reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. It's a bit more in line with my budget, and I'm still confident it's a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can do better with Bob or by selling to John.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejection:** This is the only logical option at this point. Accepting would be a huge loss. 
* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round that is closer to my desired price, hopefully, leading to a more successful negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  Keeping John as an option keeps pressure on Bob.  I want to make sure I don't get stuck with a subpar price out of fear."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value this product brings. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Pressure and Time:** This counteroffer creates more pressure on Bob, forcing him to decide if he wants to continue the negotiation or risk losing the opportunity.
* **John's Offer in Mind:** While I'm still open to negotiating with Bob, I'm aware that I have a solid backup option with John."

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round,  trying to bridge the gap further.

```

**Explanation:**

**Strategy:**

* **Rejection:** I'm rejecting this offer because I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.
* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still represents a compromise.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $875,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept this offer.

* **Pressure and Time:**  With only three rounds left, I'm creating more pressure on Bob to consider this offer seriously.
* **John as a Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer and will only accept a price that's significantly higher than Bob's current offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high.  

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a good chance that Bob will continue to push for a lower price, and I might be forced to settle for an unacceptable deal. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** By selling to John, I guarantee myself a profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum desired value.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  With limited rounds remaining, selling to John is the most secure and profitable option."
