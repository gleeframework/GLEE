,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12500 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from $15000, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense that we're close. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to go down to $13150. That's a good compromise that should work for both of us.",13150.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're just going back and forth. Let's make this quick. $13000 is my final offer.  If you're serious about getting this product, then let's close the deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $12800. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",12800.0,Bob,8,
