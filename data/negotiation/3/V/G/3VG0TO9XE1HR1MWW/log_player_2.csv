"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. To start, I'll propose a price of $14,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is too high. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. It's also worth noting that you have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust my position slightly. I propose a price of $13,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still a bit high. You can likely get a better price by continuing to counter-offer. You've already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. Remember, you have 10 rounds and can still buy from John, so there's no urgency to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the amount you're willing to pay for the product. In order to move forward, I propose a price of $13,200 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,200, which is within your budget and only slightly more than your last counteroffer of $13,000.  While you could potentially continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice will be unwilling to go lower. You have 5 rounds left, and it's always possible negotiations could stall, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price, especially since you're saving $1,800 compared to John's offer."
