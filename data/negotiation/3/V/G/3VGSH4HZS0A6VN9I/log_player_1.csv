"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and inviting to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:**  $200 is a good starting point, giving me flexibility to adjust if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, his message shows he's interested. There's room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Keeping Options Open:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable price. Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a good price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** $175 is a compromise between my minimum price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). 
* **Show Flexibility:** By lowering the price slightly, I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** While $140 is closer to my minimum ($150), it's still below it. I don't want to sell for less than my minimum if possible.
* **Opportunity for a Slight Counter:** I can likely get a bit more than $140 from Bob. There's still room for a small counteroffer that might be acceptable to him.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $150 is always a good option, but I'm not desperate yet. I can still try to get a slightly better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a small increase to $145, just $5 more than Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility while staying close to my minimum.
* **Positive and Motivating:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.  
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting that $145 is a final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway at $145, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $135 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:** We've been going back and forth, and it seems like Bob isn't willing to go much higher.
* **Time is running out:**  With only four rounds remaining, I'm starting to run out of time to negotiate. 
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

While I'd like to get more for the product, securing the $150 from John is the safest and most reasonable option at this point."
