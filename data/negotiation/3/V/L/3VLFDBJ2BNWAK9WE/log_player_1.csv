Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is a good starting point. It's a price that's above your minimum of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the offer.

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting high, you give yourself the best chance of getting a price closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Maintain control:**  You're not immediately jumping to John's offer, showing Bob that you're confident in the product's value.
* **Encourage negotiation:** The message makes it clear that you're open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the value of the product to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a bit higher than John's offer, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000).  It's not worth accepting such a low offer when you could potentially get more.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's still room for negotiation. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, which will likely lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Sell to John as a last resort:** Only choose to sell to John if you're confident that you won't be able to get a better deal with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** By offering $11,000, you're showing a willingness to negotiate while still getting closer to your desired price. 
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** The message remains polite and emphasizes the benefits of a compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:** The message highlights the ""fairness"" of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Continue the negotiation:** By making a counteroffer, you're keeping the conversation going and increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Increase the price:**  While $11,000 is less than your initial offer, it's still more than Bob's offer and closer to your target. 
* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrating a willingness to negotiate increases the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my original counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000). You can likely get more by continuing to negotiate.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's still room to meet in the middle. You can counteroffer with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable compromise.
* **Sell to John as a last resort:** You should only consider selling to John if you believe there's no chance of reaching a better agreement with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making another counteroffer, you're showing that you're willing to negotiate but also that you're confident in the product's value. This approach keeps the pressure on Bob to raise his offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $10,875.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to reach a final agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Highlight the benefits:** The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the offer and its ability to satisfy both parties. 
* **Emphasize the finality:**  The message suggests this is a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

* **Reach a final agreement:** By suggesting this is a final offer, you're encouraging Bob to accept and finalize the deal.
* **Maximize your profit:** This strategy maximizes your chance of earning the highest possible price while still securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my original counteroffer, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is not increasing:**  Bob is offering the same price as his previous offer. This indicates he's unwilling to compromise further. 
* **Reaching an impasse:** There's a stalemate in the negotiation, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better deal with Bob.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Selling to John at $10,000 is a guaranteed sale and a better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.

This decision allows you to secure a sale without further negotiation and ensures that you receive a price that's at least your minimum."
