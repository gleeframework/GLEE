,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my original counteroffer.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $10,875.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to reach a final agreement. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my original counteroffer, and I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",10750.0,Bob,6,
