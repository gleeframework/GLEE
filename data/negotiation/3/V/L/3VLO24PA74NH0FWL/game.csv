"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it will be very valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable for me, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,500? That's a significant move on my part.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,500 is closer, I can't go that low.  Would you consider $11,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my original asking price.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come up a bit to $10,250.  I'm hoping we can close this out soon.",10250.0,Bob,6,
