"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would you consider adjusting the price to something closer to $1,500,000? I believe we can find a fair solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While I understand your position, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your effort in trying to find a middle ground. However, considering my financial situation and the current market value, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while staying within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I can't go as low as $1,800,000.  My final offer is $1,900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest proposal, Alice. I've considered your offer carefully, and I believe we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions. I would like to counter with a price of $1,750,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my budget constraints.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
