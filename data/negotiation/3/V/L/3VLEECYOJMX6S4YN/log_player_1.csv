Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $8,000.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value,"" you subtly imply the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Note:**  While you aim high, be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response.  The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of you, maximizing your profit without losing the sale to John."
