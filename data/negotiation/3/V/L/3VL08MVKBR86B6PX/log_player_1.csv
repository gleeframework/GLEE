Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your valuation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but the message frames it as a ""competitive price"" and highlights the product's value, potentially swaying Bob's perception. 

By offering a high price initially, you might:

* **Anchor Bob's Perception:** He might be willing to pay more than his initial $10,000 valuation if he perceives the product as worth closer to $14,500.
* **Secure a Quick Sale:**  If Bob is particularly eager, he might accept your offer without negotiation. 

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and you sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
