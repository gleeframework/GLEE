"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Could we settle on $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works, and I want to make this deal happen.  Let's split the difference - $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
