,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise.  This is a good deal for both of us, let's make it happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I think we can do better than that. My counteroffer is $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer.  I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
