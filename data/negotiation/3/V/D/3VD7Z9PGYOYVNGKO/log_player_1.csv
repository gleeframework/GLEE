Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob sees enough value to accept. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value increases your chances of a successful deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the immense benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Acceptable Price:** $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, making it likely he'll accept.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""careful consideration"" add weight to the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the ""immense benefits"" reminds Bob why he's interested.

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims for a high sale price, there's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on his response."
