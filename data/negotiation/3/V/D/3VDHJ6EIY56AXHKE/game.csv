"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial assessment. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to your specific business model is substantial, and $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but we need to find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,125,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,125,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value this product brings.  How about $1,180,000? This feels like a sweet spot for both of us.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another option at $1,150,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
