"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me around $6,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I could consider a price of $18,000, which reflects a more accurate value."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree it's a good product, $18,000 is still too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $10,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. $14,000 is closer to where I need to be, but still a bit high. Could you do $11,000? That would be a great price for both of us, I think.
