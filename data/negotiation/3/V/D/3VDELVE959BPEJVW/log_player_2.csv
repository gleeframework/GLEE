Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me around $6,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I could consider a price of $18,000, which reflects a more accurate value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we are getting close. I can meet you at $12,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $12,500 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 fallback option with John.  

* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** You know John will sell the product for $8,000.
* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:**  Her language suggests she won't budge much from $12,500.
* **Saving money is your goal:**  Getting the product for $8,000 is a much better outcome than $12,500. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the better deal with John."
