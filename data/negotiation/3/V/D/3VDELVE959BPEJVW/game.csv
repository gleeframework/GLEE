"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me around $6,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I could consider a price of $18,000, which reflects a more accurate value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I agree it's a good product, $18,000 is still too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some progress here. Let's try to find a solution. How about $14,000? That's a significant reduction on my end and reflects my willingness to make this deal happen.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. $14,000 is closer to where I need to be, but still a bit high. Could you do $11,000? That would be a great price for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we are getting close. I can meet you at $12,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,7,
