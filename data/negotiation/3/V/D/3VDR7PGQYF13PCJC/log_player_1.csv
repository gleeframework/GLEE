"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find really valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, but still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me at this point.  While I could accept it, I want to try to get closer to my ideal price. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $150 to you."", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a slight concession, moving closer to Bob's offer but keeping it above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to try and make the price more palatable."
