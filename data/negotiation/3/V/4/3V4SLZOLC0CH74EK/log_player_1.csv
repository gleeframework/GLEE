Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation without risking losing the sale completely. If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer down slightly.
* **Avoiding John:**  I want to exhaust options with Bob before resorting to John, who offers a guaranteed but lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Profit Potential:**  While $950,000 is a good offer, I can still potentially get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  The negotiation process is working, and Bob is showing interest. A counteroffer can help us reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding John (for now):**  Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, but it's not my best-case scenario. I'm willing to gamble a bit more to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to finding common ground, I need to stay closer to my minimum price. How about $980,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 980000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for more negotiation.
* **Balancing Value and Agreement:**  $980,000 is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This makes it a tempting offer for Bob while still giving me a decent profit.
* **Maintaining Control:**  By rejecting his initial offer and offering a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a deal and that I'm in control of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, I still feel that we can find a more equitable solution. Would you consider $960,000? This price acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is only $40,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time is Money:**  The negotiation is taking time, and I'm risking losing Bob as a buyer, especially if he gets frustrated.
* **Profitable Deal:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $960,000 is still a good profit and a successful negotiation. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting the offer ensures I secure the sale and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting future counteroffers, potentially leading to a deal with John at a lower price."
