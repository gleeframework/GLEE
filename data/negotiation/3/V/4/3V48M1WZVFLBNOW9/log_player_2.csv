"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. If you're interested, let me know and we can arrange the transaction.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door to securing a better price. You're not interested in paying more than you have to."
