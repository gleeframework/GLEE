"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price. 
* **John is a backup option.**  You have the safety net of buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your budget, you're still paying $200,000 more than your limit.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Alice has already moved from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000.  This suggests she's willing to compromise further.
* **John is a backup option.**  You can always buy from John, but you should continue to try and negotiate with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is becoming difficult.** Alice has moved down a bit but is still asking for $1,050,000. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **John offers a secure deal.** You know you can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within your budget.
* **Risk of further rounds:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to accept a higher price or lose the opportunity altogether.

It's better to secure the product from John and avoid further risk of overpaying."
