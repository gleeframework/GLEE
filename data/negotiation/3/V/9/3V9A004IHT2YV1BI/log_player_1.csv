{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for a competitive price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a valuable product at a price that's significantly lower than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at a price that's more comfortable for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $950,000 is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm confident this product is worth more. How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This price still gives you a significant profit margin and is fair to both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $1,025,000? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price,  $1,025,000 is a good deal considering the time spent negotiating. It's also more than what I could get from John."
