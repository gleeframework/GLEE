"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $9,500.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed to buy from John at $10,000."
