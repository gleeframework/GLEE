Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1050000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below what I need to justify selling.  How about we split the difference and go with $1000000? This would give us both a good deal and ensure a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $980000 still falls short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's settle on $990000.
