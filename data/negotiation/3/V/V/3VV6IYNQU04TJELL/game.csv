"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm not comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a more reasonable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it a bit high.  How about we settle at $1,450,000? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1,450,000 just yet. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we settle at $1,700,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
