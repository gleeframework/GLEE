Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're not selling yourself short.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving you the chance to reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **It shows you're serious about a deal:** A clear offer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your preferred price. You want to try and get closer to your target of $140.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $135? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd prefer $135, Bob's offer of $132 is only $2 less than your preferred price.  It's a good compromise and a better deal than selling to John for $120."
