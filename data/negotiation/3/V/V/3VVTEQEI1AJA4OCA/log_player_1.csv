Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and the deal to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm open to negotiation and  leave the door open for Bob to counteroffer.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me leverage, allowing me to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product and understand its value. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have John's offer of $10,000 as a backup. This allows me to reject Bob's low offer and try for a better price.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't mean ending the deal. It allows for further negotiation and the possibility of reaching a price that is more favorable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Signal:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Midpoint Offer:**  $9,000 represents a fair midpoint between my initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the mutual benefits of the deal at this price, encouraging Bob to see it as a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to meet somewhere between our prices, I am still unable to exceed $8,000 for this product. Could we perhaps find a middle ground closer to my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my preferred range and the value I place on the product.
* **John's Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed offer of $10,000 from John. This is a better deal than accepting Bob's counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob may lead to further concessions and a lower final price. It's more efficient to accept John's offer and secure a profitable sale."
