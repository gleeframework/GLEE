"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
