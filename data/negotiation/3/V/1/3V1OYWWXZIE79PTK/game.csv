"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $125, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $115. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the best I can do. Can you consider my offer?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $115, which would be $120. It's the highest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
