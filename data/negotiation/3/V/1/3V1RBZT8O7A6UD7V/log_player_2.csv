"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that's truly worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the potential savings you're offering. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. He values the product at $1,000,000 and can acquire it for $125,000 less than his maximum budget.  While there's always the possibility of getting an even lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a small further discount."
