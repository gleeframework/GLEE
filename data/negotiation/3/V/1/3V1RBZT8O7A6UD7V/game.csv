"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value and the potential savings I'm offering you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
