Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I was expecting. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget, and I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
