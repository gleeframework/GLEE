"I have a unique opportunity for you to purchase a high-value product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle on $12,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I can do $13,200, which is still a great deal for you and gets me closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",13200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,600?",12600.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still a bit away from my minimum price. I can do $13,500, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make it work.",13500.0,Alice,7,
