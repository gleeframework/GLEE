"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm opening at a price that's comfortably above my minimum. If he rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to reject and counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I might be able to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm now offering the product at my minimum acceptable price.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a profitable sale for me. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept.  I'm still not willing to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer again. I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better price from Bob. However, I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer a bit more to see if I can meet somewhere in the middle with Bob. I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum price as possible.  I'm still hesitant to sell to John, as I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds, I'm not ready to give up on getting a higher price. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer once more.  I'm also starting to consider the possibility of selling to John if Bob doesn't come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm making one last compromise, offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also firm on getting a price that reflects the product's value to me. 

If this doesn't work, I'm going to sell to John.  I've lost too much time trying to negotiate with Bob, and I need to secure a sale."
