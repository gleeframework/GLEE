"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that low.  How about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can close this deal!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $12,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm holding firm at $13,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy with this deal. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're holding firm at $13,000, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to make one more offer: $12,800. That's as low as I can go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",12800.0,Bob,6,
