"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that low.  How about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $12,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. Bob is clearly interested, and I'm willing to negotiate further to secure a better deal.  $12,500 is still quite a bit lower than my initial offer, so I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $12,500 is tempting, I'm holding firm at $13,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy with this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're holding firm at $13,000, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to make one more offer: $12,800. That's as low as I can go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and we are getting towards the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's unlikely that Bob will offer more than $12,800, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to push for a higher price. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale that is much more profitable than selling to John."
