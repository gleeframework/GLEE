Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant ROI."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,700,000 is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our range. We'll try one more time to meet a bit higher before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,750,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,680,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, $1,680,000 is above our absolute minimum and continuing to push Bob risks losing the deal entirely. It's a good compromise to secure a sale at a price significantly higher than John's offer."
