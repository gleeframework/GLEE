Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly lower than its value to me. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the product's worth to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an invitation to discuss, showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer.  If it's close to my minimum, I might accept. If it's too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price. 
* If the negotiations stall, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum price of $1,000,000, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $850,000, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  It's a fair compromise that lets us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and a ""win-win"" scenario, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not conceding too much, still maintaining a price point closer to my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer. If it's close to $875,000, I might accept. If it's too low, I'll counter again, aiming for a final agreement.
* Selling to John is still an option if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting too low:**  His offer of $825,000 is getting too far away from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  If I keep negotiating, there's a chance I might end up accepting a price that is significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Selling to John is the safest option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

I've decided to end negotiations with Bob and accept John's offer. It's a more certain way to secure my desired profit and minimize the risk of getting a much lower price from Bob."
