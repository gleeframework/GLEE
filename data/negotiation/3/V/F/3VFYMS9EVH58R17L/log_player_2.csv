"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that aligns perfectly with your needs, valued at $12,000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000, which is a great deal considering its worth and benefits. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's a discount from your perceived value, it's still above your target price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room to negotiate a better price, as Alice is willing to sell for less than your maximum.
* **John's price is a fallback.** If you can't get a lower price from Alice, you have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering your feedback, I'm proposing to sell the product for $9,500. This is a fair compromise between the original asking price and your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $9,500 is less than your maximum price of $12,000.
* **It's a good compromise.** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Further negotiation may be risky.**  You could potentially get a lower price, but it's not guaranteed.  There are only 7 rounds left, and you don't want to risk running out of time.

Accepting this offer secures the product at a price you're comfortable with, saving you money compared to buying from John."
