"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price, but it's still within a range he's likely to consider. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the deal. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a compromise that's closer to my initial asking price.  I still have rounds left and want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you understanding the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is a little too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm proposing a middle ground price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. It also keeps the pressure on Bob to accept, as I'm already closer to his offer than my original asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,200 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 below my minimum acceptable price and he's stated it's his final offer.  It's not ideal, but I'm getting close to my goal. There's a risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer, which would be less profitable.  I'll take the $8,200 to avoid any more back and forth."
