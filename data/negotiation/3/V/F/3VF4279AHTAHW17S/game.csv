"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you.  I understand if you have to consider it, but if you decline, I have another interested party who is willing to buy it for $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
