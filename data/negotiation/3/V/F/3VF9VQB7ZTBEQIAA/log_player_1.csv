{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counter-offers. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice! However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $112 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
