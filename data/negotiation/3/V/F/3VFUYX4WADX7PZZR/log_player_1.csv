Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $150.  I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You don't actually know how much Bob values the product. You only know your minimum and that John will buy it at $100.
* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer. 

**Important:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always counter with a lower price, gradually moving closer to $100 if needed. You have a strong fallback position with John."
