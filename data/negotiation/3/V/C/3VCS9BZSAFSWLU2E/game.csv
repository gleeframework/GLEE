"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. I know this product is worth a great deal to you, and this price reflects its value while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this is the best opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
