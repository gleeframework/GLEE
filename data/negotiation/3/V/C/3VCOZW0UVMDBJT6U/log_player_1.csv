"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm prepared to potentially lower the price over the next few rounds, but I'm hoping to start strong.

**Note:** This is just the beginning of the negotiation.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap. This will demonstrate my flexibility while maintaining my goal of maximizing profit.
* **Balancing Risk:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I believe I can potentially get a better deal with Bob, especially considering I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but also that I'm not giving away too much.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product.  This helps to justify my higher price and keep the negotiation focused on the product itself.
* **Flexibility and Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's see if we can find common ground"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to respond positively.

**Strategy:**

By strategically decreasing my offer and remaining optimistic, I hope to entice Bob to accept my counteroffer. If he doesn't, I'll have more room to negotiate in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have leverage to continue negotiating. I'm confident I can push for a better deal.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still hopeful of getting a higher price from Bob. The potential reward of a better deal outweighs the risk of continuing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000. I need to find a balance between being flexible and staying firm in my commitment to maximizing my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to bridge the gap further to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true worth of this unique opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's latest offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the ""true worth"" and ""unique opportunity"" of the product. This reinforces its value and positions my offer as a fair reflection of its worth.
* **Urgency & Compromise:**  The phrase ""fair compromise"" suggests that this is a final offer and encourages Bob to seriously consider accepting.

**Strategy:**

This is a crucial round. My goal is to push Bob closer to my target price while remaining flexible enough to secure a deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess my strategy based on the remaining rounds and the risk of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Line:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 away from my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm concerned about running out of time and losing the opportunity to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, selling to John at this point minimizes the risk of getting a lower price from Bob or failing to reach a deal altogether. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the circumstances, I've decided to accept the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John to ensure a successful sale and secure my minimum profit target."
