# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. He should counteroffer or go with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $14,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value I think you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his limit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford right now.  Let's split the difference -  $12,000.  That way we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $13,500 is still above his limit. At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John, who is selling the product for his target price."
