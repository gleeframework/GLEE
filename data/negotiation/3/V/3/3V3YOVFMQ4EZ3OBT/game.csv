"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for it. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $13,000. How about we split the difference again and settle on $12,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $13,250 for the product. Can you see your way to meeting me at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,5,
