While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,800,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's a substantial profit over John's offer ($1,500,000) and closer to my initial ask.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome and delays receiving payment.
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, suggesting genuine interest and a limit to his budget."
