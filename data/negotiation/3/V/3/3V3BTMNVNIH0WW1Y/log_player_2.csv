"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than Alice's value of the product ($8,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $11,500 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a good deal for Bob:**  $11,500 is significantly lower than what Bob would pay John ($15,000). 
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Bob has already lowered the price significantly, and further negotiation might risk Alice walking away or raising the price again. 
* **Time is a factor:**  There's no guarantee that John will still be willing to sell at $15,000 if Bob delays.

By accepting this offer, Bob saves $3,500 compared to buying from John."
