Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $17,500 is a fair price. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500.

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $17,500 is a good deal at this stage.  Bob is clearly holding firm on his budget, and continuing to negotiate might make him walk away.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk getting closer to my minimum and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
