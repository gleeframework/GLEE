"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's price of $150, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $105?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, accepting Alice's offer of $105 is the best option for Bob.  

* **It's a significant savings:**  $105 is much lower than John's price of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could counteroffer again, it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  There's a risk of her getting frustrated and ending the negotiation.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a good deal and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might ultimately lead him to buy from John at a higher price."
