Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the product's value. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible, while still making a profit. I'm ready to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial proposal. If the negotiations stall, I have a backup plan in John, which ensures I won't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is better than selling to John for $80, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get a higher price, especially considering Bob is interested in the product.  I'll counter-offer and aim to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $105?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still gives me a good profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, expressing my willingness to negotiate, and highlighting the benefits of my offer for both of us. This helps keep the negotiation positive and productive. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $120, but I'm willing to go lower if necessary. My goal is to strike a balance between profit and a successful sale."
