"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you the product for $11,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",11200.0,Alice,5,
