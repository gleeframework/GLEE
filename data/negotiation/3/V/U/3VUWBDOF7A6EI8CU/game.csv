"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product has great potential.  I'm interested, but  $900,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but I need to be a bit more conservative. How about $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is already a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that. I'm ready to close this deal, but I need to be at $800,000.  Can we make that work?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $800,000. How about $812,500? This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,7,
