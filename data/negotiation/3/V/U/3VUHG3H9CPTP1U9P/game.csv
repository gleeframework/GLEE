"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still leaves a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  I'm still pretty interested, but let's try to make this work. How about $1,175,000? That feels like we are both giving a little.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
