{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but it still leaves you with a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
While $1,100,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for more.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This still leaves a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  I'm still pretty interested, but let's try to make this work. How about $1,175,000? That feels like we are both giving a little. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $1,175,000 is a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000 and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer, potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower price."
