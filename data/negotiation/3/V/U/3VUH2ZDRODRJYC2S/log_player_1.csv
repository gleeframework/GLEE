Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can agree on that.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise at $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and it doesn't look like we're going to be able to agree on a price that works for both of us.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
