{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and we're now getting close to your desired price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk she won't budge further, and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at this price and save $375,000."
