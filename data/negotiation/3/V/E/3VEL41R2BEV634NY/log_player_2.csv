"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $110 is still too high, and you can likely get it for closer to your $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. How does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is closer to your target, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You've got room to negotiate further, and you can still get it for less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $100 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm confident I can get it for closer to $95. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $98. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is $98, which is still above your target price of $80.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $80. You've successfully negotiated a lower price with Alice, but it's not worth risking further rounds to potentially get a lower price."
