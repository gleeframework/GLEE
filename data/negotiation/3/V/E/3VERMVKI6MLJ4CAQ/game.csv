"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Alice,5,
