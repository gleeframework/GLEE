{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for potential counteroffers.  It's also important to be friendly and make Bob feel like you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum goal of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you do $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum goal, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially considering that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
