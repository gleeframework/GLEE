"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $750,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for the product, which is a substantial amount and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness in acquiring the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $650,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still slightly outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this price still reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",725000.0,Alice,5,
