"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  You know the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000 for the product.  I know it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let's try to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,000, which is a good price for you considering your maximum budget is $15,000. It's also a fair price for Alice, as it's more than what the product is worth to her.  Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and the risk of a counteroffer that could be worse for you."
