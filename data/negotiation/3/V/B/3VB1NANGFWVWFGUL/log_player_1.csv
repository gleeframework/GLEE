{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation of $120, but still below your minimum of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win scenario for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $120 for this product. Would you be able to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $120 is above Bob's valuation, it's below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130 to make this work.  Let me know if that's acceptable."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still hoping to keep the price within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $125 is still below my minimum desired price, it's closer to my desired goal of maximizing my earnings. It's also a good compromise considering Bob's budget constraints. Further negotiation may take more time and effort, which I can better utilize selling to John."
