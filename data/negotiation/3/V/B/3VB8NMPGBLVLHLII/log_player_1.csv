Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible without losing the sale. Offering a price around $130 gives Bob a significant discount while still earning you a substantial profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
