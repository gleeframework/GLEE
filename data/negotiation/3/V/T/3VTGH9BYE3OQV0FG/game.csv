"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting its uniqueness.  However,  $120 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $105. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $105, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $107.50. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
