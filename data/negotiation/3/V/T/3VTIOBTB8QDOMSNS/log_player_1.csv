"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get a good price right away. However, I'm willing to negotiate down if necessary, and I'm always keeping John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a more reasonable price than my initial offer, but still closer to what I want than Bob's counteroffer. It's a good middle ground, and I think it's likely that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I think I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise between my previous counteroffer and Bob's latest offer, and I think it's a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting very close to my minimum price, but I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a significantly better deal from him.  I'm worried that if I continue negotiating, he might get frustrated and walk away completely. It's better to secure the sale with John and guarantee the $800,000."
