Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much money as possible from Bob, ideally more than the $150 John is offering.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still aiming for a price higher than John's offer.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while still making an offer enticing enough that he might accept, rather than forcing him to reject and go with John's guaranteed offer."
