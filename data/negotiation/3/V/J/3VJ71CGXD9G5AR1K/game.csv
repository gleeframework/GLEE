"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about we start at $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $80.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you the product for $81, which is still a great deal. It's a small increase from our previous offer, but I think it's worth it for the quality of the product.",81.0,Alice,5,
