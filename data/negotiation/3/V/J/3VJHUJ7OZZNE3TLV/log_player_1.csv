Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $1,500,000.
* **Potential for more:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm offering a price higher than John's. I'm hoping Bob values the product more than $1,500,000 and will be willing to pay a premium.
* **Balancing risk:** I'm setting the price high enough to be enticing, but not so high that it's likely Bob will immediately reject it. 

**This strategy balances the need to make as much money as possible with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.**"
