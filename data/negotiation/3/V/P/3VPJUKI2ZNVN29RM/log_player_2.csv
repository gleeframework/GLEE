{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is less than what you'd pay John, you can still potentially get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value for the product. This shows you are serious about buying but also want a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to his desired price.  Since Bob's maximum price is $100, buying from Alice at $90 is a good choice."
