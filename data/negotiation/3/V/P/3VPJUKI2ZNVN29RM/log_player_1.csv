Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation.  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $100, giving him an incentive to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering at $90. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair and will likely convince Bob to accept."
