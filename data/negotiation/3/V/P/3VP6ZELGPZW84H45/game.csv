"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  This reflects the value it will bring you while acknowledging my position.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $2,000,000 is still significantly higher than I'm comfortable with.  I could consider $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pretty big gap between our valuations here.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
