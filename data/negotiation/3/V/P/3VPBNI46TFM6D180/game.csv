"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 still isn't enough for me.  Let's aim for something closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
