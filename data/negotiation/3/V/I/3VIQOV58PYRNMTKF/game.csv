"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm not sure $100 is quite right for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90? It's still a good price for you, and it would be a much better deal for me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $95? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
