Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm not sure $100 is quite right for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90? It's still a good price for you, and it would be a much better deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
