{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You've already lowered the price by $20 from Alice's initial offer. While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely not worth the risk of losing the deal. $110 is still a good price for you, and you're saving $40 compared to buying from John."
