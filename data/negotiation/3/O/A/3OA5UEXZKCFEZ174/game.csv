,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still represents a significant value to you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $775,000 just isn't enough.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $825,000. This gives you a great price while ensuring I can make a fair profit. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $825,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $790,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  $790,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at $800,000 to make this work for me. It's my minimum, and I'm confident this product will be worth even more to you in the long run.  This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
