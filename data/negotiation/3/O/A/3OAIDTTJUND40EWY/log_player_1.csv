Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120 price point:** This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than your minimum value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Positive message:** Starting with a friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By expressing ""Let me know what you think!"", it encourages Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $120, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $110 for the product.  It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.  Let's see if we can agree on this!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've reduced my price from $120 to $110, showing flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Reiterating value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value (""still a great value for you"") to reinforce his interest.
* **Positive tone:**  ""Let's see if we can agree on this!"" keeps the negotiation friendly and encourages a positive outcome. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing your earnings and reaching a deal with Bob before potentially selling to John for less."
