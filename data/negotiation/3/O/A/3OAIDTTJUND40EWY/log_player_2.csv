"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll really love.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still above your ideal price point.  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $110 for the product.  It's still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it.  Let's see if we can agree on this! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your price range of $150.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance you'll end up paying more than $110 if you keep going back and forth. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids potential escalation."
