"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're starting our negotiation at a special introductory price of $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is a good deal compared to John's price of $120, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $107.50 is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's counteroffer of $105 and her previous offer of $110. 
* **Getting a good deal:** While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or having Alice become less willing to compromise is high. 
* **Better than John:** The price is still better than what John is offering ($120), making this a good deal for Bob."
