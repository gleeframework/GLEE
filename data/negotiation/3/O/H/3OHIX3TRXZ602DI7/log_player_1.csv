Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130, which is still above my minimum of $150. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'll continue negotiating and hope to reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm dropping my price to $120, which is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I'm confident I can get $150 from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
