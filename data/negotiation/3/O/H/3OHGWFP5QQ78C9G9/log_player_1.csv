Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110.

You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I'm not comfortable paying $122.5. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher than $115. Accepting his offer secures a profit of $15, which is better than John's guaranteed $100."
