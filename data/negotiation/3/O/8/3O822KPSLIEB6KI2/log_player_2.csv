"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $900,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $825,000 is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $750,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $780,000? This would be a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to meet you at $812,500, as I mentioned in my previous counteroffer. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice has clearly shown she won't go lower than $812,500. While this is slightly higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John at $1,500,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, considering he still saves over $700,000."
