"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm looking for $19,000 to start the conversation. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $1,000 to me.  How about $1,100?",1100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100 is significantly below its value. This product would be a steal at $10,000,  how about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $15,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I can do $2,500, but that's my limit.",2500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product but we're still far apart.  While $2,500 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to find common ground.  This is a significant price drop and reflects my desire to make a deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation.  $12,000 is still a bit rich for me.  I can go up to $3,500, but I need to stay close to my budget.",3500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still too wide.  I'm open to making this work, so I'm willing to drop to $10,000, my absolute bottom line.  This is a fantastic deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",10000.0,Alice,7,
