"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm looking for $19,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high.  I'm willing to negotiate, but going with John is starting to look appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $1,000 to me.  How about $1,100?"",
""product_price"": 1100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100 is significantly below its value. This product would be a steal at $10,000,  how about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but still way too high. I'll counter, but I'm getting closer to taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, $15,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I can do $2,500, but that's my limit."",
""product_price"": 2500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product but we're still far apart.  While $2,500 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to find common ground.  This is a significant price drop and reflects my desire to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely getting more reasonable, but I know John is a sure thing at $10,000. I'll push a bit further, but I'm getting close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation.  $12,000 is still a bit rich for me.  I can go up to $3,500, but I need to stay close to my budget."",
""product_price"": 3500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still too wide.  I'm open to making this work, so I'm willing to drop to $10,000, my absolute bottom line.  This is a fantastic deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has finally met my bottom line (which happens to be John's price).  No point in negotiating further."
