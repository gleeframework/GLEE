Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $975,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I must be candid that $700,000 is too far below its value. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let me know if this works for you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but she's still trying to hold out for a price well above your maximum. Her ""final offer"" suggests she's not likely to go much lower.  At this point, you're better off securing the product from John at $800,000, saving yourself $100,000 and avoiding further negotiation."
