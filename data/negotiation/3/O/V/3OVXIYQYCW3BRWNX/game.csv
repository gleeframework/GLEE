"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but your initial price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $975,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I must be candid that $700,000 is too far below its value. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
