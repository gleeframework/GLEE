"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. You have the option of buying from John for $10,000, so you have leverage to push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above my absolute maximum budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as I'm showing a willingness to compromise but still aiming for a price within my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,800 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will bring the price down to a level I'm comfortable with.  It's better to lock in the guaranteed price from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might result in an even higher price."
