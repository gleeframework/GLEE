"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $500000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $300000 for it. This reflects its potential value to me, while leaving room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",300000.0,Bob,2,

I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial considerations while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $400000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $350000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",350000.0,Bob,4,
