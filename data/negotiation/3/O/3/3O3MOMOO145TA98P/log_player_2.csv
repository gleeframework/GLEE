**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a lot higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you for $375000. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your stated budget. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and this offer is closer to my counteroffer. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and me having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high. Accepting this offer is the best option to save money and secure the product."
