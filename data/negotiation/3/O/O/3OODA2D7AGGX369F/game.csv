"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount for you, but I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1250000 is a good price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $1280000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product considering its value to you.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1200000. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to buy the product from John for $1200000, so I'm hoping we can meet at that price. Can you consider one final offer of $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
