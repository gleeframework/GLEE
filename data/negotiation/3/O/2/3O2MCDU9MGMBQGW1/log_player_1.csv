Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love! I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, which is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing confidence:** My message is positive and confident, conveying that I believe the product is valuable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By offering $130, I acknowledge that Bob might want to pay less and set the stage for potential counteroffers. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I'm confident that I can still get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I open the door to counteroffers and potentially a more favorable deal. 

I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than $130, to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120? It's still a great price for this product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and keeping the tone friendly. 
* **Strategic price:** $120 is a good compromise point. It's a significant amount more than Bob's offer, but it still leaves room for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's split the difference! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **No further negotiation:** While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $100. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing the negotiation could take longer and might not result in a significantly better outcome.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and ensure I make a profit on the product."
