Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows room for negotiation and leaves some profit potential.  I'm not sure what Bob's budget is, so I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum value, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not as high as I initially hoped, $16,500 is still above my minimum value and a reasonable compromise. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether, especially since John is only offering $15,000."
