"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to benefit from the product's value while also recognizing its worth to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to a number that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $800,000.
