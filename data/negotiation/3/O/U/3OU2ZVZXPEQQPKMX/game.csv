"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and  $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit.",8000.0,Alice,5,
