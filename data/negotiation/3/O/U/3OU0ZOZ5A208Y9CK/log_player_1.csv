"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $180? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could hold out for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $140 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds his perceived value of the product ($100) and provides me with a profit margin above my minimum ($150).  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether."
