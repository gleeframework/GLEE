Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I'm asking for $22,000.  I know this is a premium price, but I believe it reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Value justification:** By highlighting the ""true value and potential,"" you aim to shift Bob's focus from his perceived value ($8,000) to a potentially higher figure.
* **Gauge interest:** The phrasing ""chance to purchase... before I list it publicly"" creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:** Ideally, Bob accepts your offer or a negotiated price closer to your asking price.
2. **Gather information:** Bob's reaction (acceptance, counter-offer, or rejection) gives you insights into his perceived value, helping you negotiate better in the future.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You can adjust the price and messaging based on your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
