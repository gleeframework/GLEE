Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value makes it a good deal for him while still earning you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,150,000 reflects its worth while acknowledging the strong partnership we could build. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  We create a friendly and collaborative tone, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. We also hint at the potential for future dealings (""strong partnership"").
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 profit, well above your minimum. It's also a $50,000 saving for Bob compared to his perceived value, making it a compelling offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you think Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, a positive relationship with Bob could be beneficial in the long run.
