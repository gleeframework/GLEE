"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. I believe the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob sees value in it as well.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $18,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still allows me to profit from the sale. I believe this price is reasonable and might convince Bob to accept, given that he already offered $15,000.  We have several rounds left, so I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell for closer to $18,000, Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer. Given the limited number of rounds remaining, and the risk of losing the deal entirely, accepting this offer ensures I gain a profit of $1,000 and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
