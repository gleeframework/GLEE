Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, I'm not willing to settle for my minimum acceptable price this early in the negotiation. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is consistently increasing his offer, and we are now at $1,275,000.  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the risk of Bob walking away outweighs the potential reward. Accepting this offer secures a good profit above my minimum."
