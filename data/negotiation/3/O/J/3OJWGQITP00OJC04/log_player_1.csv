Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $100 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum, creating a fair and enticing deal. 
* **Avoiding an Extremely High Price:**  While you could start higher, aiming for the maximum profit right away ($120) risks Bob rejecting the offer outright. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of a successful sale to Bob, getting you a higher profit than selling to John."
