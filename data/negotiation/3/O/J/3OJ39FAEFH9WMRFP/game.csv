"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  That leaves some room for negotiation and still represents a great value for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still very interested in the product, but I really think $9,500 is the maximum I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference. How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
