"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum asking price of $120.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $115.  This is still higher than his offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, he'll accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $105 is still not enough. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm sticking with my last counteroffer of $110.  It's a fair price, considering Bob values the product at $100 and I need at least $120.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $102 is still below my minimum asking price of $120.  I'm running out of rounds, so I'm going to sell to John to secure the guaranteed $120."
