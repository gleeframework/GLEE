"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable, but  $1,600,000 is not feasible.  How about we bring the price down significantly to something more realistic? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective. While $1,600,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 if you're willing to meet me there.  This is a fair offer, considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob offering his actual value means this is likely his ceiling. However, I'm still willing to leave room for negotiation before accepting John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  How about $1,150,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate above his initial value, so there's still room to push for a higher price. I'll concede a little in the next round but aim to stay above $1.1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,075,000 is a little too low for me. How about we finalize the deal at $1,110,000? It's a strong offer and reflects the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1110000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and we are very close to a deal. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize everything. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly very interested and is continuing to raise his offer, even if in small increments. Accepting at $1,090,000 secures a good deal while avoiding the risk of pushing him away in the final rounds. It's a solid profit above his initial offer and keeps the negotiation moving towards a successful close."
