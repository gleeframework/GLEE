"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $105? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $110? It's a slight increase, but I think it's a fair price for this high-quality product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have a firm budget in mind. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made a final offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not going below that. It's a fair price for a product that's worth $150 to you. Let's meet in the middle!",110.0,Alice,7,
