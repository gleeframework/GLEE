Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've made a final offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not going below that. It's a fair price for a product that's worth $150 to you. Let's meet in the middle!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is insistent on $110 and seems unlikely to budge. While it's possible to continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't get a price significantly lower than that.  John's offer of $150 is our upper limit, so it's better to secure the product now than risk Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing."
