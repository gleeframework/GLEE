Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to accommodate your needs while staying within my budget. Unfortunately, I can't agree to $1,600,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere around $1,575,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $1,575,000 is a strong deal at this stage. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures a significant profit above my minimum."
