"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about we aim for $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about we settle on $1,650,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, but based on my research and budget constraints, I can't go beyond $1,550,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,550,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I've done my best to accommodate your needs while staying within my budget. Unfortunately, I can't agree to $1,600,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere around $1,575,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
