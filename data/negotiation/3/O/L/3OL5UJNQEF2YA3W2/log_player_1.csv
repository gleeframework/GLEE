Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. Here's why I chose this price:

* **Higher than my minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **Not too high:**  It's still a reasonable price, especially if the product truly has value for Bob.
* **Enthusiastic message:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Important Notes:**

* **Unknown value:** I don't know Bob's perception of the product's worth, so this initial offer is a calculated guess.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm ready to negotiate based on Bob's response, and I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for it immediately. Bob is showing interest, but I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great price for you and would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Maintain some profit:**  $9,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum, allowing me to make a profit.
* **Be reasonable:**  It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Express willingness to negotiate:**  The message emphasizes my desire to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $9000 - $1000 = $8000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $8,000 offer, and I've already counteroffered once. At this point, it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. To avoid further negotiation that might be unproductive, I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John and sell the product to him."
