Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is so high, implying that the product's ""value"" warrants it can be a negotiation tactic. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, indicating a willingness to discuss the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging that Bob has the final say and might negotiate a lower price."
