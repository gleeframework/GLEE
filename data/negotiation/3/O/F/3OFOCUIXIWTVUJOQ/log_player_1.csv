"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is clearly interested and is moving towards my price point. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1.1 million. Let's see if I can negotiate him up a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We are getting close, but I believe I can still get a slightly better outcome. I am aiming for at least $1,075,000."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,072,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,072,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a slightly higher amount, Bob is clearly committed and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting $1,072,000 ensures a successful deal at a price significantly above Bob's initial offer.  Continuing to negotiate at this point carries the risk of losing the deal altogether."
