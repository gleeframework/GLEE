Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value and the previous offers we've discussed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
 
It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $975,000. Since you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation rounds. You're better off taking the guaranteed savings."
