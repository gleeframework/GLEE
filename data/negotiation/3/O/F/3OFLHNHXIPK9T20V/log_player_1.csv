"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $1,050,000 is too low."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I'm not ready to accept a price below $1,100,000 yet. I want to see if we can get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,087,500. This price would give us both a good deal and move us closer to a final agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1087500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,087,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $1,075,000 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only 4 rounds left, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation are dwindling. Bob is clearly unwilling to go much higher than $1,075,000. Since John offers $1,000,000, it's more prudent to sell to John and guarantee a safe profit."
