"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This would allow me to make the purchase and would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not going any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
