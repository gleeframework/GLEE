"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 just doesn't reflect its true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which is a fair compromise given the exceptional quality of this product. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering $875,000. Can you consider this price?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $875,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and go with $925,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with this product at that price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'll meet you at $900,000, and that's my final offer. If you can accept this price, I'm willing to move forward with the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
