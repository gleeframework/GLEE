"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is quite high. We have room to negotiate a better price, so it makes sense to counter-offer. Buying from John at $12,000 is our fallback option if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I had a lower price point in mind. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We start with a significant counter-offer to try and bring Alice closer to our desired price range. This offer is still a good profit margin for Alice if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I understand you're seeking a fair price. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still be a significant saving for you compared to its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our target price. We'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to our ideal range. We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nudging closer to our goal, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving. This offer is only slightly below Alice's last one, indicating we're getting into a serious bargaining zone."
