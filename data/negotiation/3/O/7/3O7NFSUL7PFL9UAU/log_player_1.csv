"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,600,000, I aim to set a high anchor point for the negotiation. This might influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that this is an ""initial proposal"" and a ""starting point for discussions,"" signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000. I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reject Low Offer:** Clearly signal that Bob's initial offer is unacceptable to avoid anchoring the negotiation too low.
* **Justification:** Briefly reiterate the product's value without revealing specific details that could weaken my negotiating position.
* **Compromise:** Propose a counteroffer that meets Bob halfway between his offer and my original asking price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price. While I might be able to push for slightly more in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob walks away or the extended negotiation doesn't yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting ensures I get a fair deal and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
