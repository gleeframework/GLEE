"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential of this product, the price of $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. To start, I'd like to offer $600000.  I'm confident this product has value, but I'm looking to make a smart investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
