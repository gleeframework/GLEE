"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily routine and bring you unparalleled benefits. I believe it's worth more than its face value, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $150 and Alice's offer is $100, you can try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to a potential better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to adjust my offer. Considering the value of the product and your feedback, I propose a price of $90. This still reflects the product's worth while being more accommodating to your budget.

While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. You can likely still get a better price with a counteroffer."
