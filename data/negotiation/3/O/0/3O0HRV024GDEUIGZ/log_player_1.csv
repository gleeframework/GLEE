Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
