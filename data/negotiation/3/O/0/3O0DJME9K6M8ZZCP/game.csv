"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This would still give you a great value, and it's closer to my minimum price point. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but it's still a bit out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. Let's try to reach a compromise.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $88. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  I believe $88 is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",88.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $88 is still a bit high. I'm going to stick with my offer of $85. If we can't agree on that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",85.0,Bob,6,
