It's always worth negotiating, especially since you have a fallback option with John.  Let's see if we can get Alice down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to cover the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business.

Alice has come down a bit, but we're still $50,000 apart. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to our target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'll counteroffer with $1075000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and potential benefits to your business.

Alice is getting closer to our desired price.  Let's see if we can get her to budge a little more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer with $1075000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a free maintenance package and a 6-month warranty. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

While the extras are nice, Alice is sticking at $1,075,000. At this point, the potential savings are not worth the continued negotiation. It's time to cut our losses and go with John's offer."
