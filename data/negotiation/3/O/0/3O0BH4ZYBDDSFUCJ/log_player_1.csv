Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $1000000? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
