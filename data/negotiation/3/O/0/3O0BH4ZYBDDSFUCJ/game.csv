"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $1000000? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to cover the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1050000.  I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  Could we meet in the middle at $1025000?  I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'll counteroffer with $1075000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1075000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $1050000.  This would allow us to reach a mutually agreeable price and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer with $1075000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a free maintenance package and a 6-month warranty. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
