Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $14,000 in my mind. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is closer to my minimum, but still a good compromise. What do you think?

Alice is very unlikely to go below $15,000.  It's not worth risking a higher price.  Buying from John guarantees the best price."
