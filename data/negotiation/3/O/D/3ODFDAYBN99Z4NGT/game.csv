"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for countering.  $16,000 is still a bit much for me. How about we split the difference and do $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $14,000 in my mind. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, which is closer to my minimum, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
