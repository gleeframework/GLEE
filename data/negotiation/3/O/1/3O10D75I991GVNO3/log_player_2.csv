"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price range. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $875,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,000,000.
* **Better than John's price:** $875,000 is a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but also risks Alice walking away or Bob's time running out.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
