"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
