Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It's still above your $1,000,000 minimum, so you're not losing money.
* **It signals your willingness to negotiate:** By offering a lower price than your ideal, you show Bob that you're flexible and open to a deal.

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm always ready to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if a deal with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value. It also allows for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I am too. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $812,500? That's a good middle ground that gives us both a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the deal with Bob.  It's a compromise that meets him halfway from the previous round.  It's also still above my minimum price, so it's a good deal for me as well."
