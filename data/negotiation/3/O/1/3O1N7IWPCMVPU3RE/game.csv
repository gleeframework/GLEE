"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $812,500? That's a good middle ground that gives us both a fair deal. ",812500.0,Alice,5,
