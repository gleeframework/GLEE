"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Future Rounds:**  This initial offer sets the stage for a potential decrease in price over subsequent rounds, moving closer to a mutually agreeable figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm interested in exploring other options. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about a higher price while keeping the negotiation open. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your initial offer is generous, the true value of this product warrants a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $200,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Holding Ground:**  Despite the concession, I'm holding firm above both Bob's offer and my minimum price, reinforcing the product's value. 
* **Encouraging Movement:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to make a counter-concession, potentially leading to a price within an acceptable range for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,800,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is a substantial amount and falls above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, especially since he's already shown a willingness to negotiate. 

Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
