{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, and $14,500 is well above your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's space to negotiate a price that's closer to his valuation.
* **It's not too aggressive:** This price avoids pushing Bob away immediately, allowing for a potentially smoother negotiation. 

Remember, this is just an initial offer.  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your desire to either close the deal quickly or maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $13,500. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:** While $13,500 is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer and potentially leaves less room for future negotiation.
* **You're seeking a higher profit:**  You're aiming to maximize your earnings, and Bob's offer doesn't achieve that goal. 
* **You have leverage:**  You can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

Since you're rejecting Bob's offer, you'll need to send a counteroffer.  Consider a price that is slightly lower than your initial offer but still allows for a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still looking for a price closer to $14,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,750? I'm confident this price remains fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer shows flexibility while remaining firm on seeking a higher price.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:** $13,750 is significantly above your minimum of $12,000.
* **Appealing to reason:** The message highlights fairness and a willingness to compromise.

This counteroffer gives Bob some space to reconsider while still pushing for a more favorable price for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway at $13,625. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your desired price:** Bob's offer of $13,625 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $13,750.
* **Significant profit:** Accepting this offer still provides you with a substantial profit of $1,625 above your minimum.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob might walk away or become less willing to compromise, potentially leading you to sell to John for a lower price.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the proximity to your target price and the potential risk of losing a good deal, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
