"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product from John for $100, so you should reject Alice's offer of $95 and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?

You can still get the product from John for $100, and you're aiming for a price lower than $90.  Keep negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
