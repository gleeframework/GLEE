Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my target price.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
