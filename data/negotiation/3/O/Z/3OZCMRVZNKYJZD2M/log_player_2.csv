"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still quite a bit above his target of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is the worst-case scenario, so Bob should try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $950,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, considering her minimum acceptable price is $800,000. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price without immediately risking rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's desired price but still above his $1,200,000 limit.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob should try to get a lower price. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  Buying from John remains the worst-case scenario, so Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** Bob raises his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is closer to Alice's $1,050,000, indicating Bob's willingness to compromise.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While this offer is still above Bob's ideal price, it's a risk worth taking to avoid John's high price."
