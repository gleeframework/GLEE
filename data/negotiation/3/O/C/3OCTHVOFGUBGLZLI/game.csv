"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. I believe this product will bring you a lot of value.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $15,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  $9,500 is too low, but I could let it go for $13,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,000 is still pushing it for me.  How about we settle on $10,500? That's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,6,
