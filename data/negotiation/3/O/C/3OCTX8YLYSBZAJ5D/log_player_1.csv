Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a profit of $2,500.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price based on Bob's responses.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000, so you're in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away from the deal if you don't get a fair price. This strengthens your negotiating position and could lead to a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This offer is a compromise, showing you're open to negotiation but still holding firm on your value.
* **Highlighting value:** Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him can sway him to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for further negotiation, but it's above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This represents a good profit for you, and further negotiation could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price or a rejection from Bob, which would force you to sell to John for $12,000.  

It's a good time to secure the deal and ensure you make a profit."
