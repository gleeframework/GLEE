"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair given its value and potential benefits for you. Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives me some room for negotiation.
* **Positive and open:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the conversation. 
* **Value proposition:**  The message highlights the potential benefits for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:** 

I aim to get as close to my minimum price ($1,200,000) as possible in 10 rounds. However, I'm aware of John's offer and will not hesitate to sell to him if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I understand that negotiations require compromise, this offer is too far off my desired target. 

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to nudge Bob towards a more acceptable value. I have 8 rounds left and still believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,075,000. This shows good faith and signals that I'm open to finding a middle ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob again, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm reframing the negotiation as a search for a solution that benefits both of us, creating a more collaborative tone.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a small but significant adjustment in the price. This counteroffer allows me to maintain a position above Bob's initial offer but shows flexibility.  My hope is that Bob will recognize the value and be willing to meet me halfway in the next round.  If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating, keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. $1062500 feels like a fair price that benefits both of us.  It's a significant step closer to your last offer, and it reflects the true value of this product for me. I'm confident we can close this deal with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have only six rounds remaining, and I'm not willing to settle for a price this low without further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a slightly higher price, still below my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. My goal is to nudge him further towards my desired price point. If we can't reach a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,062,500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1,087,500. This price is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it gives us a good chance to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in between my previous offer ($1,075,000) and Bob's offer ($1,062,500). This shows a willingness to meet halfway and indicates that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Reasonableness:**  I'm highlighting the price as a ""reasonable compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and his desire for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Closing opportunity:** I'm emphasizing the opportunity to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  I'm confident that this offer is within a range that Bob is willing to consider, given his previous counteroffers. I'm also aware that I have only five rounds remaining before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $1087500. I'm willing to offer $1075000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  It's closer to your previous offer, and it reflects the true value of this product for me. Let's finalize this deal with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a significant step closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. While I'd still prefer to get closer to my desired price, I'm aware that time is running out and I only have four rounds remaining.  Accepting this offer will guarantee a sale and will be a considerable profit. 

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and the possibility of losing a sale to John, it's strategically better to accept Bob's offer.  Even though it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation process and the risk of selling to John."
