"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. I believe this price is fair given its value and potential benefits for you. Let's start the conversation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more by negotiating further. He has 10 rounds to work with and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1075000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a good chance of getting the product for less than $1,075,000. He's already gotten Alice to come down from $1,100,000, and he has 7 more rounds to negotiate. While he can buy from John for $1,000,000, there's still room to bargain with Alice and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. $1,062,500 feels like a fair price that benefits both of us.  It's a significant step closer to your last offer, and it reflects the true value of this product for me. I'm confident we can close this deal with this price."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1062500 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $1087500. This price is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it gives us a good chance to close this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is tempting, it's still higher than the price Bob can get from John. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to compromise, and he still has 5 more rounds to negotiate with Alice. There's a good chance he can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  It's more advantageous for Bob to reject the offer and try to get closer to his target price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,087,500. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  It's closer to your previous offer, and it reflects the true value of this product for me. Let's finalize this deal with this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
