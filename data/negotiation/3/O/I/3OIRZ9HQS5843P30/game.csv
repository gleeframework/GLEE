"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a good deal. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget but $102.50 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $98.  How about we split the difference and finalize this deal?",98.0,Bob,6,
