"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and potential concessions while still securing a significant profit above the minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly hints at the product's worth to Bob, justifying the high starting point.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a substantial sum, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  It's too early to settle for an offer this low. By rejecting, we signal that we believe the product is worth more and encourage Bob to potentially increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value this product brings to the table is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:**  We acknowledge Bob's offer with ""I appreciate your counteroffer"" but counter with a smaller price reduction to demonstrate firmness.
* **Highlight Value:**  Reiterating the ""value this product brings"" subtly reminds Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate but not at the cost of significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,000,000 represents a $200,000 profit margin, which is a significant return.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest.  This offer suggests we've reached a point where both parties feel the deal is fair.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to extract a little more from Bob, there's always the risk he walks away. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
