"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $12,000 for the product from John, there's no need to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You can try to negotiate with Alice or wait for a better offer, but rejecting her offer doesn't hurt you as you have a backup option."
