Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her value than mine. I should counter with a price closer to my own valuation to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

Alice is coming down, but slowly. It's still more beneficial for me to keep negotiating since I have a comfortable alternative with John."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  To be totally transparent, I did find a similar product for $10,000. If you could do $9,500, I'd be ready to close the deal now."",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** By letting Alice know I have another offer, it adds a sense of urgency and might make her more willing to negotiate.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving closer to her price, showing I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price that saves me money.
* **Clear Call to Action:** I'm stating that this price would lead to an immediate deal, putting the ball in her court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product for $10,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, my product is still the best in the market, and I'm not willing to go below $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:** Her language (""final offer"") and price point close to John's suggest she won't budge much.
* **Marginal savings:** Even if I could negotiate Alice down a bit further, the savings would be minimal compared to John's price.
* **Time value:**  Further negotiation takes time and effort.  John's offer is guaranteed and convenient."
