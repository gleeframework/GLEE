"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a good price for both of us, as it's a significant saving for you and a considerable purchase for me. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. While $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we are getting closer to a deal, but $950,000 is still outside of my budget. While I really appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm only able to offer $925,000. It's a significant amount, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping you'll accept this offer to close the deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000, Bob. I've already made a significant concession, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll counteroffer at $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it to close the deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,
