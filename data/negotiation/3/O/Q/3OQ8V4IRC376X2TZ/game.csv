"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,387,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1387500.0,Alice,5,
