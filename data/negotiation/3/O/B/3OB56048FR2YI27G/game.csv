"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a fortune to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. My starting price is $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair price for the value it brings.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a smart business decision. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm open to further negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  This product is truly exceptional, and I'm confident it will be a major success for you.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's split the difference. I'm offering it for $1,050,000.  This reflects the value it brings, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. However, $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's aim for a win-win. I'm offering it for $1,025,000, which is a significant concession from my initial price. This price ensures we both get a good outcome, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a smart business decision. I'm offering $950,000 for the product, which is my final and best offer. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,6,
