I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's split the difference. I'm offering it for $1,050,000.  This reflects the value it brings, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. However, $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's aim for a win-win.
