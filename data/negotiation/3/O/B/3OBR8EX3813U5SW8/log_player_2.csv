"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. This is as low as I can go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has indicated that $10,700 is her minimum acceptable price. You could continue to negotiate, but there's a good chance she won't budge further. It's more efficient to take advantage of John's offer and buy the product for $10,000, saving you $700."
