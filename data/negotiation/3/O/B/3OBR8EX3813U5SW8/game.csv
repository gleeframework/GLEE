"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. How about $10,600? That's a good compromise for both of us.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,700. This is as low as I can go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
