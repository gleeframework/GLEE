Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to your business, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant return on your investment while acknowledging the unique benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still well above your minimum.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""potential worth"" and ""unique benefits"" reinforces the value proposition, justifying the high price.

**This strategy aims to achieve a win-win outcome:** you secure a significant profit, and Bob acquires a product he values highly."
