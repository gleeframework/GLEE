{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The $12,000 price gives Bob some room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Time is Money:** I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not going to spend too much time on it. If he rejects, I can quickly move on to John who is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $9,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob is a potential buyer,  I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Time is Money:**  I don't want to waste too much time on a buyer who's not willing to meet me halfway. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price, but still significantly higher than his offer.  I want to see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a compromise between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500).
* **Still Profitable:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, and it's closer to my desired profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will tell me if Bob is serious about buying the product or just trying to get the lowest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Further negotiation is likely to result in a sale price that is significantly below my desired profit margin.
* **Time is Money:** I've already spent a few rounds of negotiation with Bob, and I don't want to waste more time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price.  Selling to John ensures I get the maximum profit for the product.

While I'm open to negotiation, I believe this is the best option to maximize my earnings and minimize the time spent on negotiation."
