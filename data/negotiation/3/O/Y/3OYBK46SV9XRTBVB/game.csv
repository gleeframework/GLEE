"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, $1,800,000 represents a more accurate reflection of the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,400,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to accept $1,550,000, but this is my absolute bottom line.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
