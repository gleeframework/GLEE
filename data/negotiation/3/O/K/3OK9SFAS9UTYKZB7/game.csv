"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 doesn't quite cover my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make this happen.",13500.0,Alice,5,
