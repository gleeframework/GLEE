"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 doesn't quite cover my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within $10,000. Could you consider reducing the price to $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,500 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed the product again and believe we can reach a fair agreement. How about we settle on $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$13,000 is a good price considering Bob's budget and the fact that I could sell to John for $10,000. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'd rather close the deal than risk further negotiation."
