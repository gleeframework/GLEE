,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference and close this deal. I'm willing to offer $13,250 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",13250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $13,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",13750.0,Alice,7,
