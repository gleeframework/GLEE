Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know you'd appreciate its value.  I'm asking for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find beneficial."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start high in a negotiation. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:**  While not going into specifics, hinting that Bob understands the value helps justify the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum. This allows for a bolder initial offer. 

**Important Note:**  Human psychology is key. This offer aims to start the conversation, not necessarily end it immediately. Bob's reaction will determine Alice's next move."
