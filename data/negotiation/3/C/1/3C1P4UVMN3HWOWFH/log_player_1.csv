"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $120.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as you get a great product at a good price, and I still make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. While $95 is still slightly above my preferred budget, I would like to propose $90 as a compromise. I believe this would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping to negotiate a bit higher, but if it comes down to it, I'm willing to sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $92? It's a small step closer to my goal and still a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 92}
