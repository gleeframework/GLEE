"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as you get a great product at a good price, and I still make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. While $95 is still slightly above my preferred budget, I would like to propose $90 as a compromise. I believe this would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $92? It's a small step closer to my goal and still a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen.",92.0,Alice,5,
