"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its value and your needs. Would you be interested in exploring a price that allows us to mutually benefit from this transaction? Let's aim for a price that is significantly above $8,000 but still reasonable for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While she claims it's worth $10,000 to you, you've already established your maximum price is $10,000.
* Her offer of $9,500 is only slightly below your maximum. There's room for negotiation.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay an inflated price. This might lead her to propose a more reasonable counter-offer closer to her own valuation of $8,000. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Alice to lower her price significantly.  By rejecting this offer, you create the opportunity for a better deal without the risk of losing the product entirely (since you have John as a backup)."
