"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if a more favorable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're putting on your product, I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. It's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or simply buy from John at his set price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $9,000, but that's truly my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate you coming up to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a clear goal of spending no more than $8,000.  While Alice is getting closer to that price, $9,500 is still outside Bob's budget.  Rather than continue to negotiate, it's more efficient for Bob to purchase from John at the guaranteed price of $8,000. This ensures he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation rounds."
