"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for Bob to potentially feel like he's getting a good deal. I've also included a friendly message to make the interaction more pleasant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm proposing $110, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  I'm also reiterating my belief in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $105. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good compromise. It's significantly more than what I'd get from John, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher."
