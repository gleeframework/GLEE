"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,550,000.
