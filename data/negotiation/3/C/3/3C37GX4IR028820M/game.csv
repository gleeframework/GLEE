"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique qualities of this product,  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a deal at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000, as that's the minimum I can sell it for to another buyer. I can offer you a compromise at $11,250. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
