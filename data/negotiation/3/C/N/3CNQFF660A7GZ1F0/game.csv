"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a more realistic price point. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe your initial offer undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I'm confident this revised price reflects a more balanced approach.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to work within that range, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've tried to be flexible, but to be frank, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I consider fair for this product.  However, I value our discussions and I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,350,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll gain.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your position.  While your latest offer is tempting, it's still a stretch for me.  I can offer you $1,100,000. That's a significant increase on my end and shows I'm serious about finding a solution. I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
