,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging your needs. Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This offer allows for some profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $900,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,000,000 is closer to my target, I'm still limited by my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and the effort you're putting in. While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still need to ensure I receive a fair return on my product. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a reasonable compromise given our previous offers. Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $975,000 is a significant improvement, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to go up to $960,000, which is a compromise on my end. Let's see if we can close the deal this round.",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your limitations, and I appreciate your increasing your offer. While I'm eager to close this deal, $960,000 is still below my desired price. Let's split the difference and go with $967,500. It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. This is my final offer, let's make this happen.",967500.0,Alice,9,
