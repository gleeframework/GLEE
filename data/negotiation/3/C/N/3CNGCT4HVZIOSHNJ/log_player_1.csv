Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a decent profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the potential gain for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement, suggesting flexibility. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer.
* If the negotiations stall or become too time-consuming, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $500,000.  If you're serious about selling, let me know if this price range works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob's message indicates he's interested in negotiating, suggesting there's potential to find a more acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter with a price higher than $500,000 but lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your range.  How about $850,000? This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm countering with a price higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:**  $850,000 represents a middle ground, potentially attractive to Bob while still allowing me to gain a reasonable profit.
* **Focus on Benefits:**  The message highlights the potential benefit for both parties, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message ends by suggesting further collaboration, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to stay within a tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I can get from John.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's message suggests he's willing to negotiate further, so there's potential to reach a more acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $750,000 but still lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference.  I'm proposing $800,000.  This price allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  I'm suggesting $800,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($850,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). This demonstrates my commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message reiterates the idea of a win-win situation, emphasizing that both parties can benefit from the deal.
* **Open to Closing:**  The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to make a decision and potentially close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I'll finalize the transaction.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider whether to make another counteroffer or sell the product to John.  I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, so I may be more inclined to sell to John if Bob continues to refuse."
