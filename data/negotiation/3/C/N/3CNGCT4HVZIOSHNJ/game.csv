"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $500,000.  If you're serious about selling, let me know if this price range works for you.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your range.  How about $850,000? This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to stay within a tighter budget. Would you consider $750,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is still below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference.  I'm proposing $800,000.  This price allows us both to benefit from the deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
