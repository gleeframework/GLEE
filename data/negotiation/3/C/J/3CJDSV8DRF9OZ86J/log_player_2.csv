"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a one-time opportunity, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it at that price if you decline.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at its full value to her, meaning there's no room for negotiation or a better deal. Since John is also willing to sell the product for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to maintain the same price while potentially opening the door for negotiation with John later."
