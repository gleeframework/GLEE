"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1200000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's right at the edge of my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900000 is still below what this product is truly worth to me. Considering its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $975000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's work towards a deal in this final stage of negotiation.",975000.0,Alice,5,
