Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
