Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm offering $115. This is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.
