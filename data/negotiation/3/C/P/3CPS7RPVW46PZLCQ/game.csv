"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $125, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $135. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $128, Bob. I think we're getting close, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132. It's the lowest I'm willing to go. Let me know if you're interested.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach your minimum price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $129. Can you consider that?",129.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already made several concessions and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $130. It's the final offer I can make. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else.",130.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one last attempt to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $130, which would be $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,10,
