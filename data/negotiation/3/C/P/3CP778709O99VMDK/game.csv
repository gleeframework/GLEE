"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm looking to make a profit.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach a deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,000. Would you consider $7,200?",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but $7,200 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $7,200, which would be $8,600. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make another compromise to reach a deal.",8600.0,Alice,5,
