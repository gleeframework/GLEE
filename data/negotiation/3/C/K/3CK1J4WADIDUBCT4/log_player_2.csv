"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice's price is higher than her own valuation, it's still $10 lower than John's price. 
* **You're getting a deal:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, you're still getting a discount compared to John's price."
