Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While the product is worth $100 to Bob, starting with a price slightly above his perceived value leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150."
