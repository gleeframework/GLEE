"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $9000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500, which is a fair price considering my limit. Let me know if we can reach an agreement at this price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
