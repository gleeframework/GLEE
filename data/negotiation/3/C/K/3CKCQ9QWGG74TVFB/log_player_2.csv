"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth significantly more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $10,000, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. He has already rejected Alice's initial offer of $10,000 and made a counteroffer, indicating his firm stance on the price. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're willing to negotiate, but $9000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, which is a fair price considering my limit. Let me know if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
