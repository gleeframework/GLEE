Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Start with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob perceives additional value not factored in. 
* **Anchor High:**  A high initial offer sets an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it, his counter-offer might be higher than if you started lower.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects your initial price."
