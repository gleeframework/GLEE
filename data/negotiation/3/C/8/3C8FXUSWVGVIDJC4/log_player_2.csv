"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $115 for the product. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him.  Accepting the offer saves him $35 compared to buying from John.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation."
