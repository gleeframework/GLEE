{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I have to prioritize getting the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer you the product for $1,150,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects its true value to me.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,100,000. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $1,200,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings to you, and it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has conceded a bit, the price is still higher than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm hoping to get it down closer to my initial offer. Since we have more rounds to go, I'll counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet my needs. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product to me.  I believe it's in our best interest to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,175,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal and both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, and we're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds. It's risky to keep pushing for a lower price, as I might end up having to buy from John at a significantly higher cost.  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,175,000 is a good compromise, and I still save a decent amount of money compared to buying from John."
