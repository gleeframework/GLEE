Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $795000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",795000.0,Alice,5,
