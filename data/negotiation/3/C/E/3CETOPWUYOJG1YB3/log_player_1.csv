"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob is offering our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Selling to John guarantees us our desired profit with no further hassle."
