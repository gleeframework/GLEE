"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a price closer to your desired amount.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $10,600. This is a fair price, and it's within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
