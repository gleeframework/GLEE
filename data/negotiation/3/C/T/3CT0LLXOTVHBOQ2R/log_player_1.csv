Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $1,200,000.
* **Bob's offer:** $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum but still below my initial asking price. 
* **Negotiation:** It's early in the game, and I have room to negotiate further. I believe I can get a better price than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While I understand your perspective, I believe the product's true value lies closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, so I'd like to counteroffer at $1200000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $1,200,000.
* **Bob's offer:**  Bob is offering my minimum, which is acceptable.
* **Jhon's offer:** Jhon is also offering my minimum.
* **Negotiation:**  There's no further upside with Bob. I have a guaranteed sale from Jhon at my minimum price.

I'm choosing to sell to Jhon because it's a sure thing and saves me the potential risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not lead to a higher price."
