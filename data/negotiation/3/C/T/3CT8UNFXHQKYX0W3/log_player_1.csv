"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing the message in a positive way to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, which can keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $100.**  While it's closer than his initial rejection, it's still not profitable for me.
* **I'm willing to continue negotiating.** I have 8 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. 
* **Selling to John is an option, but I'd prefer to maximize my profits.**  If the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to do $100.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** I'm offering my minimum acceptable price, which is still above Bob's offer.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing that the price is a ""great deal"" for Bob, focusing on the perceived value.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This tactic shows a willingness to compromise and may encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  While I'm getting closer to my target, I have 6 rounds left and I believe I can still get a better price.
* **John is a Safe Option:** If the negotiation falls through, I can always sell to John for $100, but I'm determined to see if I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a great opportunity to get this product for a price that's fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising Further:**  I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Close to Agreement:** $98 is only $3 below my minimum and closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Highlighting Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both parties to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable going above $92. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to our last four rounds, and the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult.
* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** His offer of $92 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John for $100 guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's better than risking a further decrease in price with Bob. 

With limited time and the risk of further concessions leading to a lower price, it's wise to secure the guaranteed $100 from John."
