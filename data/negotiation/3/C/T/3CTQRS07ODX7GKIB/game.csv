"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again and aim for $1,012,500.  This recognizes the value of the product while hopefully meeting your budget.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $975,000? I'm hoping this price allows us to close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
