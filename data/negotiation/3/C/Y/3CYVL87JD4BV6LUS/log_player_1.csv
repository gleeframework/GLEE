"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This is a strong opening offer, but I'm willing to negotiate down if Bob counters.  However, I'm aware of John's offer, which sets a floor for my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but that offer is unacceptable. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a reasonable profit. I believe $1,200,000 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's initial low counteroffer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is an improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm dropping my price again, but this time to the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, considering his previous offers and my minimum value for the product. If he rejects, I'll be forced to sell to John and forgo the potential of a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident Bob is willing to meet my minimum price.  While $750,000 is a better offer than before, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to settle for.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with.  It's time to secure the deal with John and guarantee a profit."
