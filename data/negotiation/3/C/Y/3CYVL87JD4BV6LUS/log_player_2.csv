This is a very high offer.  You want to try and negotiate a much lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}

This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm lower limit.  This will give Alice room to counter, but still puts the pressure on her to lower the price significantly."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down in price, it's still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While this offer is closer to your ideal price, you can still try to negotiate lower.  You are still within your budget if you buy from John, but pushing for a lower price from Alice could be worth it."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
