"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be highly valuable to your operations. My starting price is $1300000. This leaves room for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me at this moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives us both room to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your position, $1100000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal happen. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While $1,200,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get the price even lower by making a counteroffer.  It's worth pushing for a better deal as Bob only has 10 rounds to close the deal, and he can always go with John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1175000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,175,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still too high for Bob's target.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get the price even lower by making a counteroffer.  It's worth pushing for a better deal as Bob only has 10 rounds to close the deal. Remember, he can always go with John if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,160,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price that will allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1160000}
