"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it would be highly valuable to your operations. My starting price is $1300000. This leaves room for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit high for me at this moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1100000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives us both room to make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your position, $1100000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal happen. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and it would allow us to finalize the deal. ",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1175000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to close this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1175000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1160000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price that will allow us to finalize the deal.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
