(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $65, so it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
``` 

I'm offering $55 as a starting point.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a fair price considering my value for the product is $80."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down in price, but I can likely still get it for less than $60.  I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 58}
``` 

I'm raising my offer slightly to $58. It's still a good deal for Alice, and it shows I'm serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is sticking to her price range. I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can push her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

I'm going to meet Alice halfway at $60.  I'm getting closer to my goal of $55, and I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $63 is getting closer to my goal of $55, but we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. If I reject her offer, I risk running out of time and having to buy from John at $80. It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
