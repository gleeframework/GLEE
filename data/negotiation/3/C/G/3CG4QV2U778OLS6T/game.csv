"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,500,000 is already a competitive price for a product of this caliber.  To find a middle ground, how about we agree on $1,350,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,350,000, so how about we agree on $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
