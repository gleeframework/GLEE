``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming high, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counter-offer, and I'm prepared to adjust my price based on his response.  However, I'll always keep in mind that John is willing to pay $800,000, so I won't go below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but based on my assessment, I am willing to pay up to $1000000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  I'll counter-offer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it still reflects the value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $1050000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing me to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I would prefer to get closer to $1,100,000,  I'm concerned that if I reject this offer and counter again, Bob might walk away.  It's important to balance the potential for a slightly higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good amount and minimizes the chance of ending up with John's lower offer."
