"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make it worth my while.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the consideration. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about $900,000? That would be a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go while still making it worth my while to sell the product to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
