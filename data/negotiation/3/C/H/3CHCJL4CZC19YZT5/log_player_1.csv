Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too low for me, and I think I can get a better price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a bit concerned about our ability to reach an agreement. $1,300,000 is simply not enough for me.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk running out of time.  John's offer is a good one, and it's the best option for me at this point."
