"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's something that's worth $10,000 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good profit for me. What do you say?  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept, I'll be paying $12,500, but the product is only worth $10,000 to me, so I'd be losing $2,500. I'd rather buy the product from John for $10,000, which is a fair price for me.
