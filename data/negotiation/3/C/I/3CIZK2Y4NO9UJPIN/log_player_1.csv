Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any closer to your price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $96, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close, and I'm running out of time. I'd rather get $96 than risk getting $100 from John or nothing at all from Bob if the negotiations break down."
