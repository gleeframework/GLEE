"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much better to negotiate and try to get a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down on the price? I was thinking closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming significantly lower than my actual budget ($80) to give myself room for negotiation. This is a common tactic in bargaining. 
* **Polite and Interested:** My message expresses continued interest in the product while clearly stating that the initial price is unacceptable.  

Let's see how Alice responds to this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $90 is still above my budget. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate further, even if it means getting closer to my $80 fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm moving closer to my budget but leaving some room for a final round of negotiation if needed.  $75 feels like a good balance point between Alice's $90 offer and my ideal price.
* **Sense of Compromise:** My message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us, which can help keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell the product for. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and I'm not willing to pay more than my $80 limit. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John, ensuring I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
