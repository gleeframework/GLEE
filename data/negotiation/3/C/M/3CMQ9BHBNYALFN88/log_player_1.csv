Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, our goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly lower price.  
* **Appear reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below John's offer might make Bob feel he's getting a good deal.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
