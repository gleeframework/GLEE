"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to me. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $5,000 is not even close to the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $12,000 to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500. Let me know if that works for you.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can sell the product to you for $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I can do $7,000, and I think that's a fair offer. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm willing to make one more offer. I can sell the product to you for $8,500. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,7,
