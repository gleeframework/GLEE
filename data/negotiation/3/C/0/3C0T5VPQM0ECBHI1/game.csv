"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price.

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
