Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial proposal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to $9,000, $8,750 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John, and we're only a few rounds in. I'm optimistic that I can build a positive relationship with Bob for future potential transactions."
