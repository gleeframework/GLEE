,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product is worth a lot to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $75? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
