Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $80, so you don't have to go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($80) and his own stated value for the product ($80). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to the product's actual worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product is worth a lot to the right buyer. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** By suggesting a price of $90, you're splitting the difference between your initial offer ($120) and his low counteroffer ($60). This is often a good way to find a compromise in negotiations.
* **Stronger Stance:** While you're willing to negotiate, you're not drastically dropping your price. This reinforces the idea that the product has value and you're not desperate to sell it at any price. 
* **Leaving Room:** You're still leaving some room for further negotiation if Bob counters again, but you're also moving closer to your backup option of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $75? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing continued interest, his offer of $75 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $80. It seems unlikely he'll go much higher, and you already have a guaranteed sale with John at $80. 

At this point, it's more profitable to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed sale with John. It saves you further negotiation time and ensures you get your desired profit."
