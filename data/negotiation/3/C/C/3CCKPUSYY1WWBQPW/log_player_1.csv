Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's offer might entice Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate a slightly lower price, still netting Alice more than $12,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob quickly might be more appealing than waiting for John, even if it means a slightly lower profit.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is confident in John's offer of $12,000 as a backup."
