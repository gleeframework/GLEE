"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $16500.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on this.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14000 just isn't enough for me to consider.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $15250 for the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",15250.0,Alice,5,
