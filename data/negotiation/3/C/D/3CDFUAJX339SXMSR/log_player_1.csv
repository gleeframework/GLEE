``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
