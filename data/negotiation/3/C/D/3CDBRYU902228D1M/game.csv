"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $150 is a bit too low for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $220. It's a fair price considering the quality and value the product offers. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise at $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $190, but I'd like to throw in a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that complements the product perfectly. So, I'll sell the product to you for $190, and you'll get the accessory as a bonus. What do you think?",190.0,Alice,7,
