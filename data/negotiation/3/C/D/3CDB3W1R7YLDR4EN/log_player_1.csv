"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and I'm hoping to get a little extra for it. I'm confident that I can negotiate a good price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have time and  I'm confident that I can get closer to my goal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12250}
```

I'm offering $12,250. This is a smaller compromise than before, but I'm still willing to budge a little to reach a deal with Bob. The price is still significantly above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiations, and while Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm starting to run out of time. I'd rather guarantee the $12,000 from John than risk a deal falling through with Bob."
