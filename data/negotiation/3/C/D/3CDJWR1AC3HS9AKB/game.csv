"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident the product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $1,150,000, I'm willing to reduce the price by another $50,000 to $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
