"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This still gives you a substantial value for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Could you do $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but not that much. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that recognizes both of our needs. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
