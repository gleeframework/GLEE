Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Fair:** The message aims to convey the product's value to Bob while also suggesting the price is a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By setting the initial price high, Alice increases her chances of securing a more profitable deal with Bob."
