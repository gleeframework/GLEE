"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, aiming for a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). While Bob values the product at $8,000, there's room for negotiation. This initial offer allows for some potential concessions while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm willing to risk losing this deal if it means getting closer to my target price. There's still room for negotiation and I have 8 more rounds to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Bob halfway in this round. I've lowered my price from $14,000 to $13,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, hopefully encouraging Bob to consider a price closer to my desired range. I'm still aiming for a profit, but I recognize the need to be reasonable while maintaining leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a significant drop, it's still not in a range that is profitable for me. I believe that I can still get a better price with further negotiation. There's a chance that Bob's offer is his final offer, but it's a risk worth taking considering I have 6 rounds left. I can still reach a satisfactory agreement, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows continued compromise while still striving for a profit. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still holding onto a decent margin. I'm hoping that this final offer will be accepted, or at least encourage Bob to make a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price range. I'm aware that I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, but I'm confident I can still secure a better deal than Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum value.  It's clear that we're not going to come to an agreement that is profitable for me. It's better to take the guaranteed profit from John and avoid further risk of losing out entirely on a good sale."
