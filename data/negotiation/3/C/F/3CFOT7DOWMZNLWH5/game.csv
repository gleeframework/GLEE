"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, reflecting the value this product will bring to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $900000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in your product. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll be getting. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
