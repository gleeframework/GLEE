"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.
