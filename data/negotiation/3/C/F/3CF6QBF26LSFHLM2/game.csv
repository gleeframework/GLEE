"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $800,000. This price reflects the value it brings to you while still allowing me to recover a fair amount. I'm confident this is a win-win proposition.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",800000.0,Alice,3,
