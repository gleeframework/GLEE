"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $100?  That's my maximum, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for this item."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $175, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $175 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  Let's try $125. It's a good compromise, and it would allow me to buy the product without overspending."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $150, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to his budget as possible. While $150 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further.  There's a chance she might be willing to accept a slightly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still just a bit too high for me.  How about $135? It's a significant step closer to my budget, and I'm still very interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I can do $145, which is my absolute lowest price. I'm not willing to go any lower than this. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob has gone through several rounds of negotiation and Alice seems unwilling to go lower than $145. This is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $120.  He can still get the product he wants without overspending."
