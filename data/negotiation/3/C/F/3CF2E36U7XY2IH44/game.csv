Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think?,200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $100?  That's my maximum, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for this item.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $175, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $175 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  Let's try $125. It's a good compromise, and it would allow me to buy the product without overspending.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $150, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still just a bit too high for me.  How about $135? It's a significant step closer to my budget, and I'm still very interested in this product.",135.0,Bob,6,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I can do $145, which is my absolute lowest price. I'm not willing to go any lower than this. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,7,
