"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get close to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,025,000 for the product. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $975,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price for a valuable product, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1000000.0,Alice,7,
