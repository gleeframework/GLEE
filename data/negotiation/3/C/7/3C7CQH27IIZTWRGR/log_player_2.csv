"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is offering a ""deal"", $110 is still more than you want to pay. You know John will sell it for $80, so you should reject this offer and go with your better option."
