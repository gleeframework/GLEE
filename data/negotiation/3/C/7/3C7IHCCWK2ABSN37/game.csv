"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in buying if you could come down to $130.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it at that price.",140.0,Bob,4,
