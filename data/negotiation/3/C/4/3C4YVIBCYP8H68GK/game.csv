"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,175,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, while being closer to your offer.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing your point, but $1,120,000 is still too far below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle one more time.  I'm willing to accept $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that takes both our positions into account.  Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
