"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate the deal you're offering. However, my budget for this product is much lower. I'm willing to pay $85 for it right now. ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $115, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $115 is still too high for me. I can offer $105. This is a fair compromise, and it's the most I can afford right now.  What do you say?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $105, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at $110. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",110.0,Alice,7,
