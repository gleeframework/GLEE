Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product! I'm thinking $100 would be a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 price:** This is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Friendly message:**  A friendly tone sets a positive atmosphere for negotiation.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** See if he's willing to negotiate at all.
* **Start high:**  Provides leverage for potential counteroffers.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Shows a willingness to compromise. 

If Bob rejects this offer, we'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust our strategy accordingly. Remember, our goal is to maximize profit, but we'll also consider the potential for a quick sale to John if negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for us. 

We'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to try and secure a better price. We can counter with a price between $85 and our desired $120, aiming to find a middle ground. However, we also need to keep in mind the potential of selling to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for both of us, and it's a step closer to where we need to be."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** We're offering $95, which is a compromise between our previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Friendly message:** We're keeping the tone positive and reiterate Bob's interest to encourage further discussion.
* **Justification:**  We're highlighting the ""good deal"" aspect for both parties to emphasize the mutually beneficial nature of the proposed price.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** We're willing to compromise to reach a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  $95 is still above Bob's initial offer, giving us some bargaining power. 
* **Encourage further negotiation:** We're setting the stage for a potential agreement, without completely closing the door on a deal.

We'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, we'll have to weigh the risk of continuing negotiations with the opportunity to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is still below our ideal price, it's closer to our minimum acceptable price of $120 than John's offer of $120.  Here's why accepting Bob's offer makes sense:

* **Potential Loss:**  Rejecting Bob and selling to John only nets us $30 more.
* **Time Cost:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time and might not result in a higher price.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting the offer allows us to quickly close the deal and secure a profit.

By accepting Bob's offer, we're balancing the potential for a higher price with the certainty of a sale and a reasonable profit. It's a calculated decision based on the available information and the desire to minimize risk and maximize efficiency."
