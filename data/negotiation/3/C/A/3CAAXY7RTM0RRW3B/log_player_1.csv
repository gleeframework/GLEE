I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum value, but they're still not high enough to be worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
