"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your own value for it, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to push for a more favorable deal. 
* **Justified Offer:** Bob highlights Alice's own valuation of the product as a basis for his counteroffer, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this counteroffer is low, it still leaves room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer without exceeding Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $950,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum price. I'm confident we can work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice has come down from her initial price, Bob can still save money.  $1,050,000 is still closer to Alice's desired price than Bob's desired price. 
* **Pushing for Lower Price:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.  Bob can continue to try and bring the price down further.
* **No Urgent Need:** There's no indication that Bob needs the product immediately, so he can afford to be patient and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000.  I'm still trying to make this work within my budget.  I can offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a significant step towards your desired price and would make a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is just below Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob is serious about getting a deal but is still pushing for a lower price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** Bob emphasizes that his offer is a ""significant step"" towards Alice's price, making it appear more reasonable.
* **Potential for Acceptance:**  The offer is close to Alice's desired price, increasing the possibility she'll accept.  If she doesn't, Bob can adjust his counteroffer further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:**  Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer.  At $1,075,000, Bob is within his budget, saving $25,000 compared to John's price.
* **Limited Upside:**  There is limited potential for further negotiation. Alice has already made several concessions.  Pushing for a lower price may risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Constraint:**  While Bob has rounds left, there's no guarantee Alice will continue to lower her price. Accepting now secures a good deal within his budget."
