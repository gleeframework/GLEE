"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, I believe a price of $1500000 is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. This offers a significant return on investment for you while also allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is the maximum I can offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1300000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Let's finalize this deal before we lose any more time.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I still can't go above $1000000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd like to reiterate that I'm very interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
