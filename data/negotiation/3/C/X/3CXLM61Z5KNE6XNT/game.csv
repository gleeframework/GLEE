"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,000 and $16,500. How about we try $15,750?",15750.0,Bob,4,
