"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my need to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $900,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to get it for $875,000. That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's try to find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $887,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
