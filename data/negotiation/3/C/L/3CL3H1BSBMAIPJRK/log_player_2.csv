# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, you know you can potentially get the product for a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed with John if needed."
