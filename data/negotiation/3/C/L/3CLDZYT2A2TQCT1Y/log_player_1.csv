Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $10,750 is too low for me, and I think I can still get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,750 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Let's try $11,250.  That's a fair price that's still good for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $11,000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,000 is a good compromise and I'm confident it's better than selling to John for $12,000. This deal allows me to close the deal quicker and avoid the risk of further negotiations falling apart."
