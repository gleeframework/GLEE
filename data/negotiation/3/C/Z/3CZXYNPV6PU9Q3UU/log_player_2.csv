"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than what he could get from John.  There's room for negotiation with Alice, so rejecting her initial offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to John's price but leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also that he is willing to walk away if the price doesn't come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  While it is lower than her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer and continuing to counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice and allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it below what he could get from John.  This shows Alice that Bob is willing to negotiate, but also that he is firm in his desire to get a good deal.  By increasing his offer, he shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is not simply trying to get a rock-bottom price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  While it's a significant drop from her initial offer,  it's still not at a price that Bob is comfortable with.  He has time and room to keep negotiating and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but it's still below what Alice offered in Round 5 and below John's price. He's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but is pushing for a lower price.  This strategy aims to find a midpoint where both parties can agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offer is still above Bob's threshold.  He is closer to his goal with each round, but there's still room to try and secure a better deal. Bob wants to see if he can push Alice to a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but it's still below what Alice offered in Round 7 and significantly below what he'd pay for John. This is a strategic move as he's showing Alice he's serious about buying but is pushing for a more favorable price. He's hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to make a final concession.  He also has limited rounds left, so he needs to be careful about how much more he raises his offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He's been steadily increasing his counteroffers, but Alice is not budging significantly.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $1,000,000.  He's guaranteed a lower price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer, leaving him with no product."
