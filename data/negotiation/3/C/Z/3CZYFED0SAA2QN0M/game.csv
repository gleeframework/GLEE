,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $13,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. Let's settle at $13,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're making a final compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",13200.0,Bob,6,
