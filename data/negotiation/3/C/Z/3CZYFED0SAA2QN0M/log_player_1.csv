"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not yet at the point where I'm willing to take a significant loss, and I have more rounds to negotiate.  I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $13,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not yet willing to settle for a significant loss, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate.  There's still a chance Bob might come up to a price closer to my desired amount, or I can sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. Let's settle at $13,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're making a final compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already made several compromises, and it's unlikely he will go much higher.  Given that John is offering my asking price, I'm better off selling to him and securing a much more favorable deal."
