"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. Given its high value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I believe this is a fair offer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $9,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product and your budget, I am willing to agree on a price of $8,900. This allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer. I hope this meets your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.

Alice's offer of $8,900 is a good deal.  It's lower than what you'd pay John, and it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. It's worth accepting to save money and move forward with the transaction."
