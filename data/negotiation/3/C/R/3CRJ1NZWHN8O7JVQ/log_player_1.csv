"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick off our negotiation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good practice in negotiations to start with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've started significantly above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows for rounds of negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. It's only round 2, and I have eight more rounds to try and bridge the gap. I'm willing to counter-offer strategically to see if I can get closer to a price point that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the unique value and benefits this product offers, I'm proposing  $1,450,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've significantly reduced my price from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000, signaling flexibility and a willingness to make a deal.
* **Above the Middle:**  This counteroffer is slightly closer to my initial offer than Bob's, aiming to steer the negotiation towards a higher final price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a collaborative and understanding tone can help keep the negotiation moving smoothly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. He increased his offer significantly, indicating strong interest in the product. By rejecting and countering, I aim to nudge him closer to at least $1,400,000, which would be a more favorable outcome for me. I'm willing to leverage the remaining rounds to achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer demonstrates a serious commitment to acquiring the product.  How about we settle on $1,400,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and our mutual desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm near my desired price point, conveying that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** By emphasizing the ""mutual desire to close the deal,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of his own interest in the product and a successful negotiation.
* **Clean Number:** Offering a round number ($1,400,000) can sometimes make it feel more agreeable and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is the highest price I can reasonably pay and still stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, but his latest message suggests he's reaching his limit. Further negotiation might yield minimal gains.
* **Time Value:** While I have rounds remaining, prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away or my position weakening.  
* **Reasonable Profit:** $1,300,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum. Accepting now secures a good deal without risking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
