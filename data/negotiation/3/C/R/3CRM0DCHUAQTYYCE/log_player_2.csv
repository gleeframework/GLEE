{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $85 is a good start, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm offering $75, which is still a good deal for Alice since she values the product at $100. This gives her room to negotiate but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$90 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm not going to give in right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $80, showing good faith. This is a good compromise and gives Alice a chance to close the deal while still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not willing to pay $95. It's worth trying to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going up to $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make before I go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and we are running out of rounds.  It's time to move on and buy from John.  While not ideal, $100 is within my budget."
