{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8500. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $8,500 is a good price and it's better than selling to John for $8,000. It's also close enough to my minimum that I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
