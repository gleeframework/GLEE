Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a little hesitant at $11,000.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen!
