"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal! I think you'll find it's worth far more than my asking price of $160. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $80 to me, and Alice is asking for $160, which is way too expensive. I'll look elsewhere.
