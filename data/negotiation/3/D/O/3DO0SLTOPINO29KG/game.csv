"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, while also giving you a good deal. Let's try to reach a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This would still allow you a substantial profit while giving me a good deal. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
