"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I still need to ensure I get a good price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000.  This is a fair price that is closer to your last offer and allows us to both walk away happy. Let's work together to get this deal done.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'll meet you at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1,185,000. This price represents a compromise that allows both of us to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note and make this happen.",1185000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge from my previous offer of $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which will add significant value to the product. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
