Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $12,000, so $14,000 is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You want at least $15,000, so there's room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It's a strong offer:**  By expressing confidence and highlighting the value of the product, you establish a positive tone for the negotiation.

This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects the offer, you can then assess whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but my budget is $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept such a low offer right away. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain my leverage:**  By not accepting his first counteroffer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Explore better options:** I can potentially get a better price from Bob in subsequent rounds or move on to John.

I will now proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13,000? This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.  It's a significant step towards Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob that the product is valuable and offers a great deal at this price.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone keeps the negotiation moving forward.

This counteroffer allows me to test Bob's willingness to compromise while still maintaining a comfortable margin. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to re-evaluate my options and possibly move on to John."
