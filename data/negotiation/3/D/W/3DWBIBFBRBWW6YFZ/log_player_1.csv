Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's in great condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $8,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm happy to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get more than $8,000, accepting Bob's offer is the most rational choice. I'm guaranteed to get my minimum desired value, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round."
