"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've set the price at $925,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John ($925,000 vs. $1,000,000). However, you can still try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. By rejecting her offer, you can show that you are willing to walk away and give her an incentive to lower the price."
