I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount for me, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $1,350,000. This price is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while still ensuring a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob or needing to settle for John's lower offer."
