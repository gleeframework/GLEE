"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay that high of a price. I'm looking to save some money, and I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $12,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",19000.0,Alice,3,
