"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $130 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",130.0,Bob,4,
