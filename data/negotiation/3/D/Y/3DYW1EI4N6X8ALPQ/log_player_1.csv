"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $12,000, I can potentially gain a higher price if Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and being friendly to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is too far off. I can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I have 9 rounds left and can still potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Moving Towards the Middle:**  I'm lowering my price slightly but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my desired price.** While it is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and can potentially get closer to my desired price of $15,000.
* **I have multiple rounds left.**  There's no need to rush into accepting a deal that is less than ideal. 
* **Selling to John is always a backup option.**  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I achieve my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $9,800 is getting closer. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. Let's split the difference - how about $10,150? It's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair, implying that it's a good deal for both of us. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using phrases like ""walk away happy"" to create a positive feeling about the deal.
* **Moving Towards the Middle:** While I'm still above Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and moving closer to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are in round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will come up to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to buy the product for $15,000, guaranteeing me the highest possible profit.

I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but his offers are consistently too low. To avoid losing out on a better deal, I'm choosing to sell to John."
