Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The offer is only $10,000 below my previous counteroffer and only $20,000 below my initial offer.  It's a decent deal and given that we're in round 6 out of 10, it makes sense to accept.  There's a chance Bob might counter again, but there's also a chance he'll reject and I'll lose even more money if we continue negotiating."
