"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere before resorting to John's offer."
