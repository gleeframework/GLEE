Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,025,000?  That's still a great price for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While that price is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'll counter with a higher price that hopefully bridges the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating. Let's try $1,000,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
