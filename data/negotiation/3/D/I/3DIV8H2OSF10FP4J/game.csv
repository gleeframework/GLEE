"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000, considering the potential benefits you'll gain. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me is significantly lower than yours.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and your offer, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe it's worth more than that. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This way we both get a fair deal, and you can still enjoy the significant benefits of owning this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still valuing this product at $1,000,000. Let's compromise one more time. How about we settle on $975,000? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $920,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from your initial offer.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of the negotiation, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, acknowledging your needs and my minimum. Let's finalize this deal and ensure we both benefit from this transaction.",950000.0,Alice,7,
