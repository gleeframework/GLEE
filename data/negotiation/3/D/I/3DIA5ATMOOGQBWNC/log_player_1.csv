"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a fair starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value of $150 but still above my minimum of $100.  I'm hoping to get close to his value without risking a quick rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to accept yet.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this will be an attractive offer for Bob, while still allowing me to earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $115 is still a significant profit over selling to John.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
