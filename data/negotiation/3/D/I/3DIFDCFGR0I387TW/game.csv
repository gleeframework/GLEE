"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. How about we meet in the middle between $150 and $135? I'm willing to sell it to you for $142.50.",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $142.50 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, how does that sound?",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $145, which is my absolute minimum. That's the best I can do.",145.0,Alice,5,
