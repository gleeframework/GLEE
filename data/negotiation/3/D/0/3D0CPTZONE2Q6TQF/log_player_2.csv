(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John as a backup if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  This is the price I would pay to John, so it's a fair starting point for negotiations. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down to this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is still above my maximum budget. While it's closer than her initial offer, I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below my maximum budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will lead to a compromise where we can both agree on a price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.  If Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small amount.  This shows Alice I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to go any higher.  If she rejects this, I'll buy from John, as I'm confident I've made a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already made multiple counteroffers and haven't been able to convince her to come down to my price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as this is the best deal I can get at this point."
