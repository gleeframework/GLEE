"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It leaves little room for negotiation below my $15,000 maximum. I'll make a counteroffer to gauge her willingness to move on the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still comfortably below my maximum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting me halfway, which is a good sign, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we settle on $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between her last offer and my previous counter-offer. It keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price I'm comfortable with."
