"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's in great condition and would be a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is less than the $150 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That's a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $120 is less than the $150 John is asking. 
* **Bob can save some money:** Bob's initial goal was to get the product for less than $150. This offer achieves that goal.
* **Further negotiation may not be fruitful:**  Alice has already moved from $130 to $120, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. Pressing for a lower price may risk losing the deal entirely."
