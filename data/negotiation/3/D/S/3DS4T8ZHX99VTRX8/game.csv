"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 reflects a fairer deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
