"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1200000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe the product's value will be worth it to you in the long run.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle of that price. How about $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum target. I can offer you a price of $1250000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. I believe the product's value will be worth it to you, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum target, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1200000, which is $1125000. That's my final offer. Can you accept it?",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum target, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1150000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options",1150000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've made several compromises, and I'm still not getting close to my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1350000, which is my absolute final offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1000000.",1350000.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum target, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to pay. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to accept John's offer of $1000000",1200000.0,Bob,10,
