{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer is way too high. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
``` 

I'll start with a low offer of $50. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's a starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping she'll counter with something closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer is my target price, so I'll accept and buy the product. There's no need to risk getting a worse deal or going through more rounds of negotiation."
