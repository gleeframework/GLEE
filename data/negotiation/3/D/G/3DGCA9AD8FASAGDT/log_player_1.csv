Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for bargaining. I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive, knowing that it's less than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still do better with Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,500 is still significantly more than what I'd get from John.  It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no sale at all."
