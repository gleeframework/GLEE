"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from what the product is worth to Bob, but it still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm lowering my price again to $1,350,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I believe Bob is getting closer to my desired price point."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds. I'm not confident I can get a higher price with him, and risking more rounds could mean losing the deal altogether. I'm choosing to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
