"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $105? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $100. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. If this doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a sale, but I'm afraid I can only go up to $100. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,6,
