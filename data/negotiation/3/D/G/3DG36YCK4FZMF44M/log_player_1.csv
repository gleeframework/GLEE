"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that's good for both of us. It leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I'm not giving away too much value right off the bat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $8,875 is tempting, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's compromise at $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I feel like we're getting close. Would you be willing to settle at $8,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,900 is very close to my desired price point, and we're running out of time.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
