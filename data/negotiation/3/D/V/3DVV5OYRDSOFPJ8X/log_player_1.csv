Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiating.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I highlight the value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his desire to acquire it. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm prepared to offer $10500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,500 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Counteroffering:**  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial offers. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Maintain Value:**  I'm still above Bob's initial offer, emphasizing the value I'm placing on the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive tone, keeping the negotiation amicable and encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm still open to further negotiation if necessary, but I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached an impasse. Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,500 offer, and that's below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer is More Lucrative:** John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer and aligns with my minimum acceptable price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John eliminates any further risk or potential loss in value.  It's the most financially secure option."
