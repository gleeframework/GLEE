"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm prepared to offer $10500. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",10500.0,Bob,4,
