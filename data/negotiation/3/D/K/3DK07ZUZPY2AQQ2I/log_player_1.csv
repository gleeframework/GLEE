Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. My counteroffer is $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that.

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to the product's true value. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, with only 4 rounds remaining and Bob sticking to $715,000, the negotiation seems to be at an impasse.  It's better to sell to John for $800,000 and secure a guaranteed profit than risk further rounds and potentially getting stuck with a lower price."
