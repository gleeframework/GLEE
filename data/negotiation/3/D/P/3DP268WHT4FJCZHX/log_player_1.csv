"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair price considering what it can do for you."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a great profit. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""...considering what it can do for you"") might make the price seem more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price signals I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree it's a great product, $22,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below both my minimum price and my initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, it shows he's interested. Rejecting gives me a chance to steer the negotiation toward a more agreeable price.
* **Backup Option:** I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I could consider coming down to $19,000. This price reflects the quality and benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** I'm lowering my price by $3,000, showing flexibility but also standing firm on the product's worth.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again highlighting the product's value to justify the price, hoping to move Bob's perception closer to mine.
* **Aiming for Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise somewhere between his low offer and my initial high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $14,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to John's Offer:**  $14,500 is slightly below my ideal price but still above my absolute minimum. It's close enough to John's guaranteed $15,000 that it makes sense to accept.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal sooner rather than later has value. It avoids further negotiation effort and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
