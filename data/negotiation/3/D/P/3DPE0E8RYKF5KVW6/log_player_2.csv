Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $7,000, but I'm not willing to go that low.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $7,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is only $200 more than your ideal price of $7,000.  Considering that you have limited rounds and John is offering the product for $8,000, it's a good time to accept the offer."
