{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives you some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. It's also a good deal for Bob, as he's getting the product for $20 less than what he's willing to pay. This could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation and closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $88 for the product. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my spending limit. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Even though I could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk of going back and forth with Bob is too high.  I'm confident I can get my desired price from John, so I'll choose to sell the product to him."
