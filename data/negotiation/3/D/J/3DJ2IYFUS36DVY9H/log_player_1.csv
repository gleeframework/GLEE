"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $850,000 is more than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $950,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $850,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? That's a good deal for both of us, and I think it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $900,000. I have time and can risk one more round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still a bit off on that price.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go up to $882,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $882,500 is a good price, I still have some room to negotiate. There are four rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $882,500 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $885,000. This is a fair compromise and  a good price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $885,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob's final offer of $880,000 is a good price, especially considering John's offer of $800,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
