(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by making a counteroffer that's still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but leaves room for negotiation. He's aiming to save as much as possible while still being within a reasonable range for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to his desired price, he still has room to negotiate further. He can likely get the product for closer to $900,000, especially since Alice rejected his counteroffer.  He shouldn't settle until he's squeezed out as much savings as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Explanation:**

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  He's aiming for a price closer to $925,000 and still has room to negotiate. He shouldn't settle for a price this close to John's offer.  He's only in round 5, so he has more time to work out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a counteroffer that's right in the middle between his last offer and Alice's last offer.  This shows Alice that he's serious about finding a deal but is also willing to compromise.  It's a strong position, as he's still well below his maximum price and has time to work out a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's getting closer to his maximum, but there's still room to negotiate.  He has more time and can try to push for a lower price.  He's only in round 7, and he doesn't want to risk being stuck at a price too close to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now pushing harder, offering a price that's just slightly below Alice's offer. This demonstrates his willingness to get closer to a deal, while still leaving room for Alice to compromise.  It's a calculated risk, but with only a few rounds left, it's time to get serious about closing the deal.  He still has a significant buffer before he needs to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,006,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,006,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round remaining and Alice's offer increasing, Bob is at a crossroads.  He's unlikely to get a better offer from Alice in the final round.  While he's still saving money compared to John's price, the risk of not securing the product at all is too high.  Buying from John guarantees he gets the product, even if it's a slightly less favorable price."
