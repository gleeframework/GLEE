Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1500000 is a reasonable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price of $2000000.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1750000? This would allow us both to benefit from this transaction.
