"I appreciate you offering the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product, which is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer it to you for $160. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your price, but $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $150, which is closer to my budget and also reflects the value of the product to you. I hope we can agree on this price.",150.0,Bob,6,
