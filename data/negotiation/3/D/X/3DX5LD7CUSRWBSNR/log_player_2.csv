"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for less than $12,000, and he should try to negotiate a lower price.  The counteroffer will be below $12,000, but still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for both parties to gain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still below his maximum value of $15,000, and it's closer to his initial counteroffer of $10,000. Accepting this offer will save Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John. While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price from Alice, and he risks losing the deal altogether."
