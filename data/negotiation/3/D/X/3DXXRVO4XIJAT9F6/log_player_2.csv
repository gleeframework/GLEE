Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly.  How about we meet halfway?  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but we're still quite far apart. I'm open to finding a solution, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.
