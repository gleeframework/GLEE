"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it. Let's work together to find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly.  How about we meet halfway?  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,600,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  I believe this represents a fair value for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but we're still quite far apart. I'm open to finding a solution, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and your need to close the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
