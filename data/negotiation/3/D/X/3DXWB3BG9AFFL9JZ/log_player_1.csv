"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language like ""Let me know what you think"" to show I'm open to negotiation and willing to work with Bob. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can secure it for less elsewhere. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  Even though Bob is pushing for a lower price, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option of selling to John for $120, which is my floor price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and can continue negotiating towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $100 is a bit too low for me, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving halfway between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Value proposition:** I'm again emphasizing the value Bob will receive by reminding him that $110 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Direct question:** I'm ending with a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving forward. 

By offering a compromise and framing it positively, I hope to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal while still securing a decent profit for myself."
