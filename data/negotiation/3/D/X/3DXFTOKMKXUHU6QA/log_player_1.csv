"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially lets you secure a higher final price.
* **Demonstrating Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals flexibility and openness to negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving space for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 plus a desirable profit margin. 

I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer in the next round to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this still reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my original asking price and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reinforces the product's value as justification for the adjusted but still high price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm doing so incrementally to maintain a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still below my target profit range. Bob consistently offering to ""meet halfway"" indicates he's willing to negotiate further. I'll continue the negotiation to see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and your understanding of the product's value.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to accept $1,950,000. I believe this represents my final offer and a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession in this round, signaling that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that this price is a compromise to maintain a collaborative tone while standing firm.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and potentially securing a deal now, rather than risking further negotiation or accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, $1,925,000 is a strong price and exceeds my minimum. Bob is very consistently sticking to his ""meet in the middle"" strategy, and it's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome.  Accepting now secures a very good profit."
