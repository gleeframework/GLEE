"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What would you say to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significant.  I could come down to $1,200,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. To be completely transparent, I'm considering another option at a lower price point. If you can do $1,100,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
