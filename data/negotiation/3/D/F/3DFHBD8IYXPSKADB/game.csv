"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value, I'm aiming to keep my budget closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",10200.0,Alice,5,
