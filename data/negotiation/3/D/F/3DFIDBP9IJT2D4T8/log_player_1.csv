Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I want to try to get a better price from Bob. $12,000 is still above my minimum, so it's worth negotiating further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's better to secure the deal with Bob now rather than risk losing him and having to settle for John's offer."
