Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my target price, as I know the product is worth at least that to me.  This puts the pressure on Bob to make the first concession. It's a bold move, but I'm confident in the value of my product. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility, but still holding firm on a value that's closer to what the product is worth to me.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to the value of the product to him, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  While it's not my ideal price, I'm willing to accept it to ensure a sale. This also opens up the possibility for future business with Bob, if we both feel the transaction was fair."
