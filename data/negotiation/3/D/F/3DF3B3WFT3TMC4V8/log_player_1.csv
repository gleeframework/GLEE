Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value it holds for me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
