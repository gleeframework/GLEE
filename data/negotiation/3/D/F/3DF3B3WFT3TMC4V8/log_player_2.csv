"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that suits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm going to try and push for a lower price again."

Alice's counteroffer is still too high, and we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  It's getting close to my limit, so I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $800,000 to avoid further risk of not getting it at all."
