"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $18,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $16,000? I think this would be a fair compromise.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that.  This product is truly worth the price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that $17,000 is a bit steep. Could you possibly lower it to $16,500? I believe this would be closer to a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,
