{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above what the product is worth to Bob, but not an unreasonable markup. It also leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $18,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $16,000? I think this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that.  This product is truly worth the price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that $17,000 is a bit steep. Could you possibly lower it to $16,500? I believe this would be closer to a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is closer to my desired price point, and while I'd prefer to get $17,000,  it's a good compromise.  I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by pushing for a higher price."
