Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, my maximum budget remains at $8,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

Explanation:  Bob has been firm at his $8,000 limit. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result. Accepting John's offer avoids further haggling and secures the guaranteed $8,000."
