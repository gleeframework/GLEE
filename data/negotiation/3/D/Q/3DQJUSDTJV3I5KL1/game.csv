"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1800000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself. Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $1200000. Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which still leaves room for us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know if you're open to that.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
