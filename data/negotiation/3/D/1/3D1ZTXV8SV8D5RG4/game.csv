"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on $12,000, but that's still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $11,500. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'm not going to budge from that price. I'm starting to think that we're not going to reach an agreement, and I might have to consider other options...",12000.0,Alice,7,
