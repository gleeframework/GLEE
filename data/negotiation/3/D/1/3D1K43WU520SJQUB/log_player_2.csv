"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and potential impact, I am extending an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While the price is lower than what John is offering, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and the initial offer leaves a significant margin for potential savings."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your initial offer, $950,000 is still higher than my target price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer represents a considerable reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** $850,000 is still above Alice's minimum value for the product, indicating a potential for a deal.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This offer is a good balance between your needs and mine, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Increase:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise but still pushing for a lower price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject this offer.  While Alice's counteroffer has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal target.  Since Bob has only used 5 out of 10 rounds, there's still room for negotiation and a potential for a better deal. Bob should try to push for a price closer to $875,000 or even lower in the next round."

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, $890,000 is still slightly above my target.
