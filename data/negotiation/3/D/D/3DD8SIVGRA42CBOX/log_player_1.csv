{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum value, but still below the product's value to Bob. This should create space for bargaining while maximizing my potential profit.  I'm also using friendly language to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000. While I want to secure a deal with Bob, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'm choosing to reject his offer and move on to the next round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $850,000? This would still be a good value for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum value of $800,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000, which ensures I get my minimum value."
