"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of what the product is worth to Bob. It also demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is looking for a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price of $12,500.  It's important to remember that Bob has 10 rounds to close the deal, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that isn't ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $12,500. Would you consider $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than Alice's most recent offer. This shows Bob is willing to negotiate but is still trying to save as much money as possible.  It also keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
