Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value highly. Given its unique benefits, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair for both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond the $800,000 guarantee from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle.  
* **Confidence and Justification:**  The message implies the product's value while giving a reason for the high price. This makes Bob more likely to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of Bob accepting the offer."
