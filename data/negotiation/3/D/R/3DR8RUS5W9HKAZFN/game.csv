"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm committed to finding common ground. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could go up to $950,000, but that's my limit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm keen on seeing this deal go through, but to be frank, $950,000 is still below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the same price I can get elsewhere.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
