Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob is profit-driven. He gets a $50,000 discount from its value to him, and you earn a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting a limited-time offer and other potential buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and perceive the offer as more valuable."
