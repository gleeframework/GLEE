Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $12,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still space for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling like you're giving away too much.
* **It's a fair price:**  $14,000 is less than the product's value to Bob, giving him an incentive to accept.

Keep in mind that you can adjust this offer based on Bob's reaction. If he rejects, you may need to lower your price slightly, but remember that John is always an option if you feel like you're getting too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still try to get a better deal. 

Here's why:

* **You're still leaving money on the table:**  $12,500 is less than the $14,000 you initially offered, and  you know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **You can use John as leverage:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer gives you power in the negotiation.

You should counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, but still slightly lower than Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize your profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to go down a bit from my original price, but $13,250 is the best I can do.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is good:

* **It's a compromise:** It's in the middle between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **It's still profitable:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It shows flexibility:**  You've shown you're willing to negotiate.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if you feel like you're not getting a good enough price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000? I'm willing to walk away if it's not a good deal for me 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **It's a good price:** $13,000 is a decent profit for you, especially considering John is willing to pay $12,000.
* **You've already compromised:** You've lowered your price twice, showing flexibility. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob is threatening to walk away, which could leave you with John's offer, which is less profitable. 

By accepting this offer, you secure a good deal and avoid risking losing the sale entirely."
