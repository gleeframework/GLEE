"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. It's a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $10,000 to both of us.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything below my minimum price of $10,000. I still have time and another buyer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for profit. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's offer and the fact that I have another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's still lower than I initially wanted, it's closer to my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's better to secure a profit of $1,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
