"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $9500. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still looking to save as much as possible. While $9,500 is closer to his target price, he can likely negotiate further. Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to make another counteroffer, potentially reaching a price closer to $8,500."
