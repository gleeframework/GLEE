Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but unfortunately, I cannot meet your price of $1,825,000. I would like to make one last offer of $1,775,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what we can mutually agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000.

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,775,000 is a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
