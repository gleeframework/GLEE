Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better price.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** While $150 is a significant markup, Bob might be willing to pay a premium if he values the product. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
