"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice.  I'd be willing to go up to $70 for it.  Do you think that would work?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $70. I'm willing to make one more concession - how about we meet at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",85.0,Alice,5,
