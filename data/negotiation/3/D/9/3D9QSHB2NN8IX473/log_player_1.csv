Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth $190, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum ($150) and John's offer ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if vague) can make it seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to see how interested Bob is and adjust accordingly. If he outright rejects it, I can always lower the price, knowing I have John as a backup."
