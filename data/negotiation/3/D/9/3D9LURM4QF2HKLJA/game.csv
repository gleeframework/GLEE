,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $12,000 for it right now.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I see you're serious about this. How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?  That's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $13,000.  If you can't accept that, I'm going to have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
