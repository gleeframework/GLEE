"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth $8,000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's unlikely Alice will accept a lower price right away.  It's better to start the negotiation and see if we can get a better deal.  We have 10 rounds, so we have time to explore options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I value the product, $8,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Given the value it offers, I would like to propose a price of $7,750. This reflects a compromise between our initial positions. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still too high for my budget. It's worth pushing for a lower price since we have more rounds left. I can counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one to show I'm serious about buying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,750 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $7,600. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 7600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the quality and value of the product, I am proposing a price of $7,650. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and aims to meet us halfway. I hope this proposal is more suitable for your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,650, which is only $50 more than my last counteroffer of $7,600.  This is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's also a significant saving compared to buying from John at $8,000."
