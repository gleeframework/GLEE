"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good deal while leaving room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better deal with Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a great price for such a valuable product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal today.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob and the remaining rounds in the negotiation. Accepting his offer secures a sale and maximizes my earnings at this point."
