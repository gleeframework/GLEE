"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a great price for such a valuable product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let's make this deal happen!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal today.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
