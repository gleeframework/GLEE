"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from owning this product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
