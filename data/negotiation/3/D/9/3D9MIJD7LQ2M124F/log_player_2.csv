"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  He has a better deal with John at $1,000,000, but he's not ready to give up on negotiating with Alice yet.  There's still room for Alice to drop her price further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the best offer Alice has made so far, and it's very close to Bob's budget. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject his counteroffer or decide to sell to John instead.  It's better for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product, especially since the price is still better than what John is offering."
