Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** I'm aiming to get more than my minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so there's space for him to make a counteroffer without losing too much.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A much higher offer might cause Bob to immediately reject it, potentially ending the negotiation prematurely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $500 less than my initial offer.  This is a small difference and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a few more dollars of gain. It's better to secure the sale at this point rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
