"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low.  How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. Can you consider that?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,6,
