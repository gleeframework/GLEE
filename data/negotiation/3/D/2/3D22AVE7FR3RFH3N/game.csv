"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. While $14,000 is better, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? That would be a great price for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
