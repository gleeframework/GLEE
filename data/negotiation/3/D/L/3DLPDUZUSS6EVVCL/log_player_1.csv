Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $850,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with an offer of $850,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Message:** I've kept the message brief and positive, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing the offer as a good deal.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, so I'm starting high. By offering $850,000, I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers without immediately settling for the minimum.  I'm also showing confidence in the product's worth, which could encourage Bob to accept my initial offer.  However, I'm prepared to counter if needed, or to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I am willing to pay $799,999 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $799,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $799,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, it's still slightly below my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and secure a higher price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming to find a price that is closer to my initial offer of $850,000 while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $799,999 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the true value of the product while still leaving room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $825,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, highlighting the value of the product and my willingness to compromise. I'm framing the counteroffer as a chance to find a mutually agreeable solution.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my desired outcome while still being within a range that Bob is likely to consider. By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating flexibility and increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation. However, I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my offer to $810,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead us closer to reaching an agreement that suits both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $810,000 is within my acceptable range.  It's only $10,000 less than the $825,000 I was hoping for, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  

**Strategy:**

It's important to be realistic and recognize that negotiating is a give-and-take process.  While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  It also avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection, which could ultimately lead to selling to John for a lower price."
