"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the product's worth to me. I'll be watching Bob's response closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is better than selling to John, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I'll try to gauge how serious Bob is about buying the product and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his low price. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial $150 price point, but I'm also recognizing that he's not willing to go much higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $125. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over selling to John and we're already four rounds into the negotiation.  It's likely that further negotiation would only lead to more back and forth and I'm willing to take the $125 to close the deal."
