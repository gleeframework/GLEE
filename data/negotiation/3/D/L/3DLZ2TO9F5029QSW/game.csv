"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer if you don't want to go that low.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you at $128. It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",128.0,Alice,5,
