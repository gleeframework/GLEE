{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, given its value to him."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $9,000 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
