{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,400,000. It represents a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already earning more than your minimum desired price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **It shows you're serious:**  You're not starting at a ridiculously high price, indicating a willingness to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob's interest shows he's willing to buy, and you can likely get closer to your desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You have a guaranteed alternative if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your bargaining position and can try to push for a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This would still leave you with a substantial profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  This price is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum.
* **Highlight the value:** Remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Offer a win-win scenario:**  Emphasize that the proposed price still provides a good deal for him.

By offering a counter-proposal, you're actively engaging in negotiations and demonstrating your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close, but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below it.  
* **Negotiations are progressing:**  Bob's willingness to counteroffer indicates he's genuinely interested in purchasing the product.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you can always sell to John.
