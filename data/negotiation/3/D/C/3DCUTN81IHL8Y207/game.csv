"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,400,000. It represents a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This would still leave you with a substantial profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your desire to find a middle ground, and your offer is getting closer. However, I still need to be at a price that reflects the product's value.  How about we compromise at $1,225,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
