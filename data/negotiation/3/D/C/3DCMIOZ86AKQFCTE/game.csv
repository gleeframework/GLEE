"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on this valuable product. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the transaction.",800000.0,Alice,3,
