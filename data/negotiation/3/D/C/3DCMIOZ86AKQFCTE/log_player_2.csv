Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on this valuable product. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the transaction.
