Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,150,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more aggressive initial offer to Bob."
