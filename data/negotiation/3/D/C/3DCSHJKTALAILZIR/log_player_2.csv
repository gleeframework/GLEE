``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,150,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your ideal price. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal or get her closer to your desired spending limit.  You're not in a rush since John acts as a backup option."
