"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it has the potential to be hugely beneficial for you, even more than my initial asking price of $2,300,000 reflects.  What are your initial thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up.  While that offer is closer to the mark, I need to be realistic about this product's value.  How about we land at $1,950,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up again.  That said, $1,700,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.  To make this work for me, I'd need to see $1,825,000.  I'm confident that at that price, this will be a highly profitable investment for you.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
