Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($8,000) making it an attractive deal while leaving me a $1,500 profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, there's a slight possibility for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even higher sale price."
