"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to sell at that price just yet.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price in the next round.  It's time to close the deal."
