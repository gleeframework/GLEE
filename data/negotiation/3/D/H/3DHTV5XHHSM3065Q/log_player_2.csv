(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $900,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price.  There's no guarantee you'll succeed, but it's worth trying before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $900,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to make a bold move to encourage Alice to come down in price. This offer also acknowledges that Alice needs to make a profit but suggests a lower price that is still within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer, but still within your budget.  However, you can likely get a better deal if you continue to negotiate. There's always a chance that Alice might be willing to come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  This counteroffer is closer to Alice's potential profit, but still leaves room for negotiation and reflects your commitment to finding a compromise.  It also shows Alice that you're willing to be reasonable, but are determined to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is too high.  This offer is very close to your maximum budget and there's no guarantee that she will come down further. You've already made multiple counteroffers, and it's unclear if further negotiations will be successful. Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees you the product within your budget, even though it's not the ideal price.  It's better to ensure you get the product than risk losing it to another buyer by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
