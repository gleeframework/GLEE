Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Bob's offer is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. Selling to John at $12,000 would yield the same outcome, so there's no point in rejecting Bob's offer and potentially going through more rounds of negotiation."
