Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $800,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more to acquire it.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** You're willing to sell for at least $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This gives Bob a chance to negotiate, which can make him feel more involved and invested in the deal.

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest while still protecting your minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, you can consider a slightly lower counteroffer, but you always have the option to sell to John for your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider your proposal of $975,000. However, I would like to counter with an offer of $960,000. I believe this price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while providing a fair deal for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer of $960,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum acceptable value, it's a good deal considering the risk of going back and forth further. There's always a chance he might change his mind or I might not be able to get a better offer in the next round.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, but it's a guaranteed outcome.  Accepting Bob's offer gives me a reasonably good profit and finalizes the deal."
