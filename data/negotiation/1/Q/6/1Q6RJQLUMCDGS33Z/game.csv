"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more in the range of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's worth it to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,200,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $1,150,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,160,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
