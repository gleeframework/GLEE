"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am more than willing to consider offers that reflect its true significance. Given its intrinsic qualities and the impact it could have on your endeavors, I propose a purchase price of $950,000. I believe this offer strikes a balance between valuing the product appropriately and ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product's features and benefits. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. However, it's significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price. Alice might be motivated to lower her price to avoid losing the sale entirely.
*  While John offers a guaranteed price of $1,200,000, there's a chance to get a better deal from Alice.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you open the door for further negotiation with Alice, potentially securing the product for a price closer to, or even lower than, $950,000."
