"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I can offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
