* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's value of $1,500,000 means there's space for him to make counteroffers and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It establishes a strong starting position:** This shows Bob you're serious about a good price, encouraging him to counter seriously."
