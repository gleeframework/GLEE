"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item. I think it's really worthwhile. How about $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is only willing to pay our minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation to get a higher price. It's best to sell to John and avoid wasting time on further haggling."
