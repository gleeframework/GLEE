"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still far above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a better option with John, so it makes sense to reject and counteroffer Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,100,000. This price takes into account your investment and the benefits you'll gain from owning the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You can get the product for less from John, so it's still better to reject and counteroffer again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,050,000. This price is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but her price of $1,050,000 is still outside your budget. At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you are getting closer to your maximum budget with each round. You've already made two counteroffers, and it's likely that further negotiations will become more time-consuming. 

It's more efficient and financially beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000, securing a better deal and saving you time and effort."
