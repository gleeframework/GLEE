"Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than you're asking. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial price. Would you consider $1,130,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while also working for you.",1130000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,130,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,090,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but $1,090,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I know this product has significant value for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,110,000.  I'm willing to accept that price if we can close the deal now. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1110000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,110,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,070,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1070000.0,Bob,6,
