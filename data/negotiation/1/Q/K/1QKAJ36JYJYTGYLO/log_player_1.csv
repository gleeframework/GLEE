"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly influencing Bob's perception. 
* **John as Backup:** While I have a backup offer from John, it's too early to resort to it.  I want to explore maximizing my profit with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than you're asking. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant jump from my initial ask. While it's above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial price. Would you consider $1,130,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while also working for you."", 
""product_price"": 1130000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer with a $20,000 decrease, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification and Compromise:** I'm reiterating the product's value while framing the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial compromise. 
* **Leaving Room:** This offer keeps the negotiation space open, allowing Bob to counter or accept,  and avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,130,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,090,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating more aggressively now, but his offer of $1,090,000 is getting too close to John's standing offer.  I'm willing to push back one more time to see if I can get closer to $1,100,000.  I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but $1,090,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I know this product has significant value for you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,110,000.  I'm willing to accept that price if we can close the deal now. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm being more assertive in this round. Stating  $1,090,000 is ""too low"" sets a stronger boundary.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting $1,110,000 as my final offer and mentioning ""other options,"" I'm signaling a willingness to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't agree.
* **Strategic Compromise:** $1,110,000 represents a smaller concession on my part.  It's a final attempt to secure a price that is both profitable and acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,110,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,070,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not moving toward a reasonable compromise. His offer of $1,070,000 is getting too close to my fallback option with John. It's clear that Bob is trying to anchor the negotiation significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  

Rather than risk further lowball offers and potentially lose both deals, it's in my best interest to accept John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
