Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

``` 
```tool_code

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60

``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:This is a starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer but still leaves room for me to potentially meet in the middle and stay within my budget."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'd like. There's room for further negotiation to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that is closer to my budget while still offering Alice a price significantly higher than what I'd pay John. It encourages a quicker negotiation process."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, it's still above what John is offering. I'll try one more time to see if I can get it down to $80."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very patient, and I appreciate that.  I can do $80, and I think that's a very fair offer considering it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:This is my final offer and matches my limit. It's a strong offer that meets my needs while still providing Alice a reasonable profit.  If she rejects this, I'll go with John."")
