"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's initial offer is within your budget, it's wise to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if a better deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (25% less) gives you room to negotiate. It also shows you're serious about buying but willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $137.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise. It's closer to my initial counteroffer of $125 and still within my budget. Accepting this offer saves me $12.5 compared to buying from John."
