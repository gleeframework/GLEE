"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,425,000?",1425000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can meet you at $1,425,000. How about we try $1,375,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,375,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1,400,000. This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about this deal, let's close it at this price.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $1,350,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
