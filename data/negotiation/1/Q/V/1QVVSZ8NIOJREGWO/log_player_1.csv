Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to aim for the highest possible profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $400,000 discount from what it's worth to him, and Alice still earns a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Exclusivity Factor:** By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" it might make Bob more inclined to accept, as it implies he's getting a unique opportunity."
