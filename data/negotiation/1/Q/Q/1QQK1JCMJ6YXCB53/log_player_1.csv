Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties,  starting high allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price significantly above her minimum. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product's value to Bob, it hints at its significance by emphasizing ""exclusivity,"" ""value,"" and ""potential.""
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The high price provides room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially leading to a final price still above Alice's $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Backup option:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
