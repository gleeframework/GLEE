"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it!  I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, knowing the product is worth at least $80 to me. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:** While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming for a higher price if possible.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Bob's offer indicates he's interested, but also that he might be willing to pay more than $80.
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, potentially reaching a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob, I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price for both of us to encourage a quick agreement.
* **Maintaining a high price:**  While it's a compromise, I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited rounds:** We're only halfway through the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing Bob's interest.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though it's not my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer now allows me to potentially build a relationship with him for future transactions."
