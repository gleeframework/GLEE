"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we aim for $1,100,000? I appreciate your understanding.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1,250,000 is quite high given the current market conditions and the value I place on the product. Could we possibly aim for $1,225,000? I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
