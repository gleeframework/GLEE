Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable, but I have my budget limits. How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to where it needs to be, I'm still a bit far off. How about we settle at $800,000? This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but I'm not ready to settle for $800,000 yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us."",
