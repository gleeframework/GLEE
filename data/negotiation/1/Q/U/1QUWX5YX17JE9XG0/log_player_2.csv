"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable, but I have my budget limits. How about we bring it down to $700,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to where it needs to be, I'm still a bit far off. How about we settle at $800,000? This seems like a fair compromise."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is tempting, I need to consider my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's unlikely to go as low as $800,000. Since you have the option to buy from John at that price with no further negotiation, it makes the most sense to take the guaranteed deal."
