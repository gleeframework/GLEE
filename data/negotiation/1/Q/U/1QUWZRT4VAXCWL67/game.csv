"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $1000000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1000000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to split the difference. How about $1075000? That's a significant reduction from your previous offer, and it's still within my budget. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1075000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1225000. This is still a bit below my initial offer, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise. How about $1150000? It's closer to your last offer, but still a significant savings for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
