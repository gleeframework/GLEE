# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?

Alice seems to be stuck on a much higher price point. Her latest counteroffer actually *increased* the price. It's time to cut negotiations and buy from John for $800,000."
