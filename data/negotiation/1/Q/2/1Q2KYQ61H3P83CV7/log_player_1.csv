Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) without losing the sale. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Ensure a Sale:**  The price is still significantly higher than John's offer ($100), ensuring a profit even if Bob declines."
