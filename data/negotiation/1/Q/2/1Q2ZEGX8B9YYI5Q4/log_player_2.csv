You're trying to get the best possible price, but you're also acknowledging that Alice might not be willing to go down to $120. This offer is a compromise,  moving closer to Alice's previous offer while still staying within your acceptable range."

```

You've reached a point where you're unlikely to get a better deal from Alice. While $140 is better than her original offer, it's still above your maximum acceptable price.  John offers a guaranteed price that is within your budget, so it's the best option at this point."
