Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800000 is a fair offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. This reflects the value I see in the product and the potential I believe it has for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.
