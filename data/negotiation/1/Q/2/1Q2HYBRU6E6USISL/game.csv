"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity with a significant potential for growth. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's fair considering its potential. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800000 is a fair offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. This reflects the value I see in the product and the potential I believe it has for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1000000 is a more reasonable price for this product. I'd be willing to make a serious offer at this price, but I need to know if it's something you'd be willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
