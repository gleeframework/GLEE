"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, reflecting its value to me and leaving some room for us to find a mutually agreeable price. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While that number is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to move closer to your range.
