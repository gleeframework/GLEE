"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This strategy allows me to maximize potential profit while also keeping the option of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price of $10,000.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me since it's above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal for me and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm not going to risk further negotiation, especially since I'm only four rounds in. If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
