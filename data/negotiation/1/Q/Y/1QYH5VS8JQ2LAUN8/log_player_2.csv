{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for your budget. You've been negotiating for several rounds, and it seems unlikely that she'll drop her price any further. At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase the product from John at the guaranteed price of $100. You've saved yourself the time and effort of further negotiation, and achieved your goal of acquiring the product within your budget."
