Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $800,000 (to John if Bob declines).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to him.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price higher than $800,000 without alienating Bob completely. Since you don't know how high Bob might be willing to go, a reasonable strategy is to start with a strong offer, leaving some room for potential negotiation.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The $950,000 price is a significant markup from your minimum, aiming to maximize your potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message portrays the value of the product and assumes Bob understands its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the offer is firm, the wording leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated but finds the price a bit steep.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How you proceed depends entirely on Bob's response. Be prepared to negotiate if he counters. If he outright rejects your offer, you always have John as a backup. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important for future dealings, you might consider a slightly lower initial offer.
