"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $107.50.  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  Let's try $109. This is a great product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
