"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that number is a little low for me to accept outright, I'm willing to move significantly to find common ground. How about we consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, the increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a satisfactory price for me. John's offer is secure and meets my minimum."
