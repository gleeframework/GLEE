"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that number is a little low for me to accept outright, I'm willing to move significantly to find common ground. How about we consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,
