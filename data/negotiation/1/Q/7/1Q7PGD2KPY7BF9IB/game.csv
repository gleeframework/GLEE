"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $850,000 is a great starting point, it's slightly below what I need to make this deal work. Would you be willing to consider $900,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
