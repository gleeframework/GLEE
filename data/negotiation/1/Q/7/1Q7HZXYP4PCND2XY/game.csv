"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go over $850,000.  This is my absolute maximum, let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down a bit to show my commitment to making this work. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
