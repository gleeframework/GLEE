"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85? Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal. He has 7 rounds left, giving him room to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to $85.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $91.25. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price lower. While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above his ideal. He has 5 rounds left, giving him more room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. How about $89?  I think this price is fair for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is still a decent deal for Bob, considering his maximum price is $100. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with nothing is higher than accepting this offer.  It's better to secure the product at a price within his budget than risk losing the opportunity."
