"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This price still leaves significant value for you and allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
