{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer allows me to get a significant portion of the value the product has to Bob, while also leaving room for potential negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in buying at a price that is still favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I need to make sure I get at least my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This price still leaves significant value for you and allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my initial asking price, it's above my minimum threshold of $800,000. It's a fair compromise, and I want to avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or Bob walking away completely. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale."
