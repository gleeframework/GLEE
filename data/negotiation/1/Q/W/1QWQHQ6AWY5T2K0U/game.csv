"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,300,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a substantial gain.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
