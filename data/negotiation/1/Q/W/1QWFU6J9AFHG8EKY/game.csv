"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford right now. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would represent a fair deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $12,000.  This is a significant step towards a compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I can accept.  Let's settle at $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can offer while still reflecting the product's worth.",15000.0,Alice,5,
