Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $875,000 is a good deal considering the possibility of Bob backing out or me needing to sell to John for a lower price."
