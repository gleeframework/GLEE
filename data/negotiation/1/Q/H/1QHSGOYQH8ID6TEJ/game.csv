"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $120. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $180. How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $150, which is $165. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
