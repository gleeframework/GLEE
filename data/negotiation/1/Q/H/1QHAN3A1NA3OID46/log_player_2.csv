"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely get a better price than $10,000.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He knows Alice will likely accept a price higher than $8,000 (her value for the product) and lower than $10,000 (her initial offer). $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, giving Alice some profit while still saving Bob money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's a better price than John's offer and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly lower price, so accepting this offer is the most logical choice to save money and finalize the purchase."
