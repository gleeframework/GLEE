"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the benefits for both of us.  This helps to create a more agreeable atmosphere. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I've left room for Bob to make a counteroffer, knowing we'll have multiple rounds to come to an agreement.

**Important Note:** 

This is just the beginning of the negotiation.  I'll need to carefully consider Bob's response in each round, adjust my strategy accordingly, and be prepared to walk away if necessary to get the price I want or to sell to John as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my initial offer, it's still not enough for me to sell the product. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still potential for him to increase his offer.  

**Strategy for Next Round:**

I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, perhaps $1,100,000. I'll use a similar positive framing as before, reminding Bob that we're both trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is still a good price for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the Price:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This demonstrates that I'm serious about closing a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to give away the product at a significantly lower price. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  My message emphasizes that this price is still beneficial for both of us, encouraging Bob to see that I'm not simply trying to squeeze the maximum profit out of him. 
* **Setting a Deadline:** The phrase ""Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone"" subtly implies a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to take this offer seriously. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll be prepared to lower my price further if necessary, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price range, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. There's still a significant gap, and I believe I can push for a higher price, especially considering I have John as a backup buyer.

**Strategy for Next Round:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, maybe $1,050,000.  I'll continue to emphasize the mutual benefits of a deal and express confidence that we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'll also remind Bob that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, subtly putting pressure on him to make a decision. However, if Bob doesn't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John, ensuring I don't settle for a price below my minimum acceptable value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  I think this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a slight compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.  It also creates a sense of urgency, implying that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Positive Framing:**  I reiterate that this price is fair for both of us and emphasizes a happy outcome for both parties. 
* **Call to Action:** I encourage Bob to close the deal and move forward. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to go lower or if it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I'll also be sure to consider the remaining number of rounds and the potential for future counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,025,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, even though we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While it's a small improvement, I'm not willing to settle for a price this low.  I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially considering John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,500,000.

**Strategy for Next Round:**

I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, maybe $1,040,000. I will continue to emphasize the mutual benefits of a deal and the fact that we're getting close to a successful outcome.  However, if Bob continues to reject my offers, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,040,000. This is the final adjustment I can make, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1040000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm presenting this as my final offer, implying that I'm not willing to go lower.  This creates a sense of urgency and potentially motivates Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product, subtly emphasizing that he's getting a good deal at this price.
* **Time Pressure:** I mention the limited time remaining to encourage Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

I'm now at a critical point in the negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round to ensure I don't lose out on my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,030,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are in round 8, meaning only two rounds remain. Bob's counteroffer of $1,030,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While there's a possibility that we could agree in the next two rounds, I don't want to risk ending up with a price far below what I'm comfortable with.  John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,500,000, so selling to him ensures I maximize my profit and avoid potential disappointment with a lower price."
