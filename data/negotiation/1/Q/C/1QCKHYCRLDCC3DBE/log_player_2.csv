"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($10,000 vs. $8,000).** This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.**  While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's a chance you can get a better price by negotiating.

**Next Step:** You will make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to her value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm eager to sell to you, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,500?  That would allow us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your limit of $12,000.** It's a good compromise. 
* **Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.** 
* **By accepting, you save $2,500 compared to buying from John.** 

This decision balances the desire for a lower price with the risk of losing a good deal and having to settle for a higher price from John."
