{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a good price for you, allowing for some profit, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to push for a better deal. There's still room to negotiate and I'd rather try for a higher price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm eager to sell to you, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,500?  That would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9500}
