Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum ($14,000) gives him a sense of getting a deal while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000 if Bob rejects the offer, so I'm not pressured to accept anything below that."
