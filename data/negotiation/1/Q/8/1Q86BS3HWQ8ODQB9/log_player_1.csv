Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer allows me to earn more than my minimum price of $120 while still being within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay. It leaves room for negotiation, as he might counteroffer, and I can then adjust my offer accordingly. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. Since John is willing to pay $120, I'll take the guaranteed profit and sell the product to him. This eliminates further negotiation and ensures a better outcome for me."
