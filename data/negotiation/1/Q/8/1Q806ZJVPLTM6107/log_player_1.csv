Round 2

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob seems to be stuck at a price point significantly lower than my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance I won't be able to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $120, which is a better outcome than potentially settling for a lower price with Bob."
