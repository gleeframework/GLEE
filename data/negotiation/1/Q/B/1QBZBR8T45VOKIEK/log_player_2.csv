You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $8,000, and she's offering it for $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still too high. You're comfortable paying $8,000, and John is willing to sell it for that price. It's better to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
