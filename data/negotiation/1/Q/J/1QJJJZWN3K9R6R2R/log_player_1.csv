"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. My asking price is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high at $12,000, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me leverage.
* **Message:** I'm framing it positively, focusing on the value to Bob, not my own need for money. This builds rapport and avoids making Bob feel pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target. I'm willing to counteroffer and potentially come down a bit, but I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Jhon's offer:**  I'm keeping Jhon's offer in mind as a safety net, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate my desire for a higher price. I offer a compromise ($10,500) by meeting him halfway, showing flexibility.
* **Price:** $10,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining some leverage. 
* **Goal:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept, securing a better price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant amount less than I'd like to receive. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to increase his offer. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll try to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Jhon's Offer:** I'm aware of Jhon's offer and will keep it in mind as a backup, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $10,000 is still below where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, how about we split the difference at $10,250?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts to negotiate but stand firm on my desire for a higher price. I emphasize the need for a ""fair compromise"" to create a sense of urgency and to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Price:** $10,250 is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and a small decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining my leverage. 
* **Goal:** I'm hoping this final compromise will be enough to convince Bob to accept, securing a price that's close to my desired range while still avoiding a deal with Jhon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I still think $10,250 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  Bob has shown a reluctance to increase his offer further, indicating there's limited room for further negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already halfway through our negotiation rounds. Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time.
* **Jhon's Offer:** Selling to Jhon guarantees a price that meets my minimum and is significantly higher than Bob's offer. 

Since my goal is to maximize my earnings, accepting Jhon's offer is the most logical choice at this point. It ensures I receive a price I'm satisfied with and avoids the risk of losing a deal with him by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
