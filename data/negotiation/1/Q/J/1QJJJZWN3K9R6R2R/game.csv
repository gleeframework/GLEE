"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. My asking price is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you meet me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $10,000 is still below where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, how about we split the difference at $10,250?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I still think $10,250 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
