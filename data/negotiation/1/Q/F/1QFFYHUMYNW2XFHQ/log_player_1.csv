"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value and the quality. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $18,000.  There are 8 more rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $14,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him as I have 6 more rounds to get a better deal. Selling to John would net me a lower price, and I'm confident I can do better than $14,500 with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference. How about $15,250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $14750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below the $15,000 I can get from John. There are 4 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal with Bob, as we're already at $14,750. Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, but I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! I'm willing to drop my price to $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
