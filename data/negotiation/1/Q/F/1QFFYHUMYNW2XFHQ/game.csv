"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value and the quality. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $14500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference. How about $15250? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $14750?",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! I'm willing to drop my price to $15000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,7,
