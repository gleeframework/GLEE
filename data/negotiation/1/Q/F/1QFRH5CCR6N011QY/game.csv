"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $90 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $75. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $78? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $81. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",81.0,Alice,5,
