"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's settle this now. How about $1,175,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
