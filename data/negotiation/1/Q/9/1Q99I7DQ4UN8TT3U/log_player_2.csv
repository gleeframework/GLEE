Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's settle this now. How about $1,175,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's a good deal considering I can always get the product from John for $1,000,000.  Let's accept the offer and move forward."
