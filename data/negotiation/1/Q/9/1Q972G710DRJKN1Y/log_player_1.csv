I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I will sell to John for that amount, ensuring I get my desired value.  While Bob values the product lower, there's a chance he might still accept due to potential future gains or other factors.  This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still having a backup plan."
