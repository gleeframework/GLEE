{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a price higher than your minimum:**  $13,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Providing justification:**  Mentioning the value to Bob helps him see the potential worth of the deal. 
* **Keeping the door open:**  The message invites Bob to engage in conversation, which is crucial for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is below your minimum price, so it's not a good deal for you. You should reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is now at your minimum price of $12,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering you could sell to John for the same amount. Accepting ensures a sale and avoids any further negotiation."
