"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential to bring significant returns to your business.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $800000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's close this deal at $800000, and we can both move forward.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $800000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
