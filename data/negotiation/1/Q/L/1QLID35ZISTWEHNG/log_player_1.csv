Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $180. I believe this product offers significant value, and this is a very fair price."", ""product_price"": 180}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are too far below the product's value to me. It's unlikely he'll reach a price I find acceptable, so it's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
