"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer is much higher than both your budget and John's price. It's highly unlikely Alice will accept an offer below $80, so it's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $120 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant drop from her initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation while staying well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $95 is still too high. It's closer to her value than yours. We need to incentivize her to move closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we try $75?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counteroffer aims for a middle ground between Alice's last offer ($95) and our previous offer ($65).  It's getting closer to our $80 limit with John while still offering Alice a potentially appealing profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  Let's try to wrap this up. How about $85, my final offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85. While closer to your goal, it's still more expensive than buying from John at $80.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
