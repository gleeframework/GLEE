Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John for $120 guaranteed, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially getting you closer to your $120 minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is just above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below your guaranteed sale price ($120). This makes it more tempting for Bob to consider. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept, but this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit."
