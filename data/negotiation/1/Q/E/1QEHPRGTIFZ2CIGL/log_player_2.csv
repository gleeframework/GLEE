It seems like Alice is stuck at $9,500 and unwilling to budge further.  At this point, the negotiation is stalling and it's unlikely you'll get a significantly better price from Alice. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $12,000.  While not ideal, it's better than potentially wasting more time and still ending up at or near that price with Alice."
