"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to my goal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a product you're interested in.",11500.0,Alice,5,
