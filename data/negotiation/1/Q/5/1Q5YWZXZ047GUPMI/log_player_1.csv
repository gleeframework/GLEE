Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to emphasize its potential benefit for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion and counteroffers.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'd like to receive. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's a good chance Bob will increase his offer further if I reject his current proposal. 
* **John's Offer:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000, so I have room to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired value, but still within the realm of what Bob might consider acceptable.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I frame the offer as a ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency:** I mention closing the deal quickly to create a sense of urgency and potentially incentivize Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm prepared to make further counteroffers or even accept his offer if it gets closer to my desired value. I'll also continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting very close to my desired value, and much closer than my initial offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd prefer to get $950,000, continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is higher, the difference is not significant enough to justify risking losing Bob and potentially having to start negotiations with a new buyer.

At this point, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most rational decision. It secures a good price while minimizing the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that might lead to no sale."
