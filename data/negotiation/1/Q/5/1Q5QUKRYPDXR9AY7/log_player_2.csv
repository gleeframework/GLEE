"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* It's worth exploring a counteroffer to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,000 is within Bob's budget of $15,000 and is a good compromise from the previous round. 
* Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal to John."
