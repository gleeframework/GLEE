"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $17,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
