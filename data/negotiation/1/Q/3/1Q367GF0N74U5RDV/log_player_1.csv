{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to see if Bob is genuinely interested. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to start strong and see where it goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $15,000 is a better offer than my minimum, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to move, I can get Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is only $500 less than my last counteroffer. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.  It's still significantly higher than what John would pay, so it's a good deal for me."
