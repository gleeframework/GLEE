"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $750,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $925,000. This reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
