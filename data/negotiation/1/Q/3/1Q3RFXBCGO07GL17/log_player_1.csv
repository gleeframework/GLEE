"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $17,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price as possible without risking losing him to the counteroffer or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,500. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for him to accept, but I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubbornly staying at $14,000.  While I could keep negotiating, it's starting to look like this deal isn't going to get me closer to my minimum price.  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is a much better outcome for me at this point."
