# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and it's still above your maximum budget. There's no point in continuing the negotiation. You can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John, which is a much better deal."
