"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll be interested. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is high.  Bob should aim to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd like to offer $600,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $600,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price and demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer is a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $750000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's target. There's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to attempt to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise.  $700,000 is a middle ground between Alice's offer and Bob's previous offer.  This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still focused on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $700000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $775000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, but there's still room for negotiation.  While Bob could accept this offer and save $225,000 compared to buying from John, there's a chance that Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiations open and allows Bob to try to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $775,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $725,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while staying within his budget. $725,000 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating Bob's commitment to finding a solution. This counteroffer is a strong attempt to finalize the deal without exceeding Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. $725000 is a good offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it for a moment. Let me see... I'm thinking of a price of $800000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in this round is higher than her previous offer, and is also higher than Bob's maximum budget. With only 3 rounds left, the chance of negotiating a lower price is unlikely. Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees Bob the product within his budget."
