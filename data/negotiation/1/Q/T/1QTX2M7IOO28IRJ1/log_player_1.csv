Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for something worth $120 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a starting point while leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100 for this. How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price that's still below my ideal but closer to it. This shows flexibility while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is a good price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to go that low. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below my ideal, it's very close, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much better outcome.  It's also possible that Bob will walk away if I reject his offer, leaving me with only the option to sell to John for $120.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action in this situation."
