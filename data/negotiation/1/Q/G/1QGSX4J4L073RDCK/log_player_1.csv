Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite, and then adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable value, but I don't want to settle for the lowest possible price. I'm going to try and see if I can get a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, but I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $125, which is better than selling to John for $120.  While I'd still prefer to get $135, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
