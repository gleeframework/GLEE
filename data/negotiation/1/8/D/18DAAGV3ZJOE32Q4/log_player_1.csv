I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a fair starting point as it's above my minimum price of $10,000 and leaves room for negotiation.  It also recognizes that Bob values the product at $12,000, leaving him some potential profit.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000. This is still above my minimum and I'm confident Bob will see the value in this deal. It's a fair compromise that bridges the gap between our initial offers."
