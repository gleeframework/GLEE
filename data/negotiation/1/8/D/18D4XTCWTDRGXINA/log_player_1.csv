Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $700,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of what's being offered, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $850,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $825,000. That's a much smaller difference, and I think it's a fair compromise.
