"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product. It's something that I believe will be extremely valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. I'm offering it to you for $850,000, a price that reflects its worth and the potential benefits you'll gain.  If you're interested, please let me know. However, please understand that if you decline this offer, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $800,000. I hope you'll seize this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $850,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option, as Bob can then purchase the product from John for $800,000."
