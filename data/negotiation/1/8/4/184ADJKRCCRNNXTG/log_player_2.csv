"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great value at a price of $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You can do better than $90. You're willing to pay up to $100, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I think $85 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.5. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still aiming to save money. While $92.5 is better than $90, it is still above your ideal price.  It's worth trying another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. How about $90?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've reached a point where Alice is unlikely to go lower. Accepting the offer at $92 is the best choice. While you didn't get the lowest price, it's still within your budget and saves you $8 compared to buying from John."
