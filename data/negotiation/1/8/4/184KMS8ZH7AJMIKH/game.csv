"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $10,000? This would allow me to purchase it without exceeding my financial limits.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $11,500? It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers good value for you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
