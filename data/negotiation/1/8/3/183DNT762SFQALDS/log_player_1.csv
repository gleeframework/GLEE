{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a high but not unreasonable price:**  $1,050,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but also showing that you value your product.
* **Being polite and open to discussion:** The message conveys that you are open to hearing Bob's perspective and are willing to negotiate further. 

This approach aims to maximize your earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting a better deal than selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your starting point and below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for you. 

While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a compromise that works."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is within a reasonable range:**  The price of $950,000 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintains open communication:** The message emphasizes the desire to find a compromise and shows a willingness to negotiate further. 

This counteroffer maintains your leverage while showing flexibility, hoping to find a middle ground and avoid selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still not sure that's a good fit for my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $925,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired value for the product.  

* **Rejecting the offer:**  You still have a chance to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Considering John:**  You have a guaranteed alternative with John, which gives you leverage to hold out for a better deal.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still hoping for a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a fair price that's close to your offer, and it gives you a significant discount from my original asking price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 940000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway (almost):** The price of $940,000 is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** You still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, which adds to your negotiating power.
* **Expressing willingness to compromise:** The message emphasizes your desire to find a compromise and avoid a stalemate. 

This counteroffer shows a commitment to negotiation while remaining firm on your value for the product, hoping to secure a deal close to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $930,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $930,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  You have already made several compromises and have reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a significantly better price.  

* **Selling to John:** This option guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation that may lead to a lower price.

While you may be able to continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of further concessions leading to a lower price than selling to John is too high."
