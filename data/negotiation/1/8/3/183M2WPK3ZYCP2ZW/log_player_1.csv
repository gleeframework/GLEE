Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **Maximizing Profit:** $11,500 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, giving you a healthy profit.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000. He gets a $500 discount. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While offering a lower price might seem tempting to get a quicker acceptance, it might not be worth the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and you being forced to sell to John for $10,000."
