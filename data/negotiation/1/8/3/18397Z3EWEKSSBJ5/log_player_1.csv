Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's mutually beneficial while still exceeding my minimum of $1,500,000."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000 just yet. I'll see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
