While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it seems like the negotiation is getting stuck.  Since we are approaching the end of the rounds, it is better to buy from John to avoid further delays and ensure you get the product.  While you'd be paying more than your ideal price, you are still getting a better deal than Alice's offer."
