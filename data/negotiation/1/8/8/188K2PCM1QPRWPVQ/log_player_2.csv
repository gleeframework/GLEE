"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Could you do $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic might seem aggressive, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to go lower.  We want to aim for a price close to Alice's value ($120) while staying well below our own limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do $130, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. It's a great product, and I think it's worth the investment. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

Alice is coming down, but we still have some wiggle room before hitting our $150 walk-away point. Let's see if we can get her closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 120
}
```

We're aiming for a win-win here, proposing a price that aligns with Alice's perceived value of the product. It's a strong offer and leaves little room for Alice to counter without going below her own threshold."
