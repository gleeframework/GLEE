"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $8,000 for the product. This is still a significant saving for you compared to the value it holds for you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
