Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, recognizing its value but reflecting my own financial constraints. This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Given your previous concessions and my eagerness to close this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's reach an agreement and finalize this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my $1,500,000 minimum.  It's not worth risking losing John's guaranteed offer for a potentially lower outcome with Bob."
