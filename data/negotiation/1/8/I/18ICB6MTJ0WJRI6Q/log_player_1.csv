Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 110} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($120). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $110 offer allows room for Bob to counteroffer while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the option to sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob fail, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, accepting Bob's offer of $100 is a very good deal. It significantly exceeds my minimum acceptable price of $80 and provides a $20 profit.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob withdrawing his interest. It's better to secure a strong profit now."
