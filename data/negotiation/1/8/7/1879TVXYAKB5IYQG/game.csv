"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to propose a price of $110 for the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? This would be a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. How about we consider $115 as a compromise?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $115 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  Let's try $116. This is only a dollar more than your last offer, and it's a significant step closer to my minimum.",116.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Considering your last offer, how about we aim for $114 as a new midpoint?",114.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $114 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $115? This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,7,
