"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate (""willing to offer it to you"").
* **Creating Urgency:** While I have 10 rounds, I don't want to give the impression that I'm desperate. I'm setting a reasonable starting point and leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to propose a price of $110 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $150. While it's closer to my initial offer, it's still not enough for me to accept. ** 
* **The negotiation is still in its early stages, and there's room to potentially reach a more profitable deal for me. I'm not desperate to sell at this point.** 
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob through further negotiation.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($125) and Bob's offer ($110). This shows a willingness to compromise and could lead to a quicker agreement.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Keeping Room for Negotiation:**  $117.50 is still above my minimum, giving me some flexibility if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we consider $115 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.**  While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that point. 
* **The negotiation is progressing, and I believe there's a good chance I can get Bob to go higher with a few more rounds.**
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $115 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  Let's try $116. This is only a dollar more than your last offer, and it's a significant step closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 116}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm only raising the price by a dollar, showing that I'm genuinely trying to reach a compromise.
* **Highlighting Progress:**  I'm emphasizing that this is ""a significant step closer"" to my minimum, reminding Bob that we are making progress.
* **Creating Urgency (Subtlely):**  I'm suggesting that we are getting closer to the end of the negotiation (""getting a bit more""). 

This approach aims to nudge Bob towards my desired price without pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your last offer, how about we aim for $114 as a new midpoint? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $114. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $114
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.**  While it's getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling at that point. 
* **The negotiation is progressing, and I believe there's a good chance I can get Bob to go higher with a few more rounds.**
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, but I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.**

I'm willing to take a bit more risk and continue the negotiation with Bob, hoping that we can find a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $114 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $115? This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm again proposing a price exactly in the middle of Bob's offer ($114) and my previous offer ($116). This reinforces the idea of compromise and shows my willingness to find a solution.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm reiterating that this price is a ""fair compromise"" and a ""good deal for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency Building:** By suggesting it's a ""good deal,"" I'm subtly implying that time is running out and we should reach an agreement.
* **Leaving Room for Finality:** While $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is truly unwilling to go higher."
