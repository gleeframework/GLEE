"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, as he's aiming to pay no more than $15,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob offers $9,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a good starting point for negotiation. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair price. It's a good balance between getting a lower price and not immediately making the negotiation hostile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still a bit higher than Bob's desired price.  There's still room for negotiation to bring the price down closer to Bob's target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his counteroffer slightly, indicating a willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still within his budget and hopefully close enough to Alice's price to encourage a deal. It's important to remember Bob's goal is to save money, so he shouldn't jump at the first offer that's slightly better than John's price."
