Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very consistently working towards his target price. We need to push back more firmly to signal we won't go below a certain threshold. We're still in a good position to negotiate higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible, but I need you to understand this product's value. I can't drop below $1,080,000 and still feel good about this deal. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1080000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** This message establishes a clear bottom line, signaling to Bob that further lowballing won't be effective.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reminds Bob why he's interested and counters his downward pressure.
* **Urgency:**  Stating ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to seriously consider the deal now."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so how about $1,055,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,055,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,055,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we're above our absolute minimum, Bob is clearly anchored at his price point.  We risk losing him entirely if we push further, leaving us with John's lower offer.  Taking $1,055,000 now is a safer bet than gambling on the last two rounds."
