"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be fair, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. I'm confident that this price will be more acceptable to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
