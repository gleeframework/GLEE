Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
