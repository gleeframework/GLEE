"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $875,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and the value of the product. However, given my financial situation, I am unable to move past $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope this can be a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Bob,4,
