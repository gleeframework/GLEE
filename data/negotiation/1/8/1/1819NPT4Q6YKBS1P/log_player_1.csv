Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's  highly valuable to you, and to reflect its worth, I'm setting the price at $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I start with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) to aim for the maximum possible profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I introduce a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to accept the offer quickly without overthinking.
* **Justification for Price:**  While not explicitly stating his valuation, I imply that the price reflects the product's high value.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk.  Bob might be turned off by the high price and reject it outright.  However, with the fallback option of John, I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of a higher profit."
