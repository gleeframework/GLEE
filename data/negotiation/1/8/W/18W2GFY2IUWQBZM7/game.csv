"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for a price that benefits both of us? Would you consider $100 for this exceptional product?",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $100 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. This price is fair for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product, I think we can find an even better compromise. How about we aim for a price of $90? This would allow me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being attractive to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While $90 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit lower. How about we settle at $88? This price allows me to buy the product without exceeding my budget, and also gives you a good profit margin.",88.0,Bob,4,
