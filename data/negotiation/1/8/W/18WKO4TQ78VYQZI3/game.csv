"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still pushing my budget. Could you consider $9,500?  That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  $9,500 is still quite low.  Would you be willing to do $11,500? I can't go any lower than that.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for $10,000. That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,6,
