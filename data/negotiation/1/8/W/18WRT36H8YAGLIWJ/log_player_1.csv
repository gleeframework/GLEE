Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and am confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of this product.  While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Could we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what's on the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point. We are still in a strong position with a backup offer from John. Holding firm and countering again keeps the negotiation moving and allows us to potentially secure a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I respect that. Let's try this: $1,875,000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you say?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm getting close to my target, but I'd like to make one more push. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has landed back on his previous offer of $1,800,000. While we could push further, it's unlikely he'll go significantly higher. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $300,000 over John's offer.  Continuing to push risks losing Bob altogether."
