"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible, $750,000 is significantly below what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. ",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures the deal gets done. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
