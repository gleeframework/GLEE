"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,000,000, Bob can likely do better.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and the option of buying from John for $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible while still getting a good deal. This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $950,000, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000, leaving room for potential negotiation. This allows Bob to test the waters and see how far Alice is willing to go to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he still has room to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal. Since he has 10 rounds to negotiate and the option to buy from John for $800,000, there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's not optimal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, but still keeping it below his $800,000 limit from John. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying but also trying to get a good price. It allows for further negotiation while leaving some room for both parties to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still too high for Bob.  He has 6 rounds left and the option to buy from John for $800,000, so there's no need to settle for this price yet. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push Alice closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying. This counteroffer is a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating that he's willing to meet Alice halfway. However, it's still below Alice's offer, leaving room for further negotiation. It's a strategic move that keeps the negotiation moving while keeping Bob's goal of saving money in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is continuing to compromise, but $915,000 is still too high for Bob. With 4 rounds left and the option to buy from John for $800,000, there's no need to settle yet.  Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push Alice closer to his target price. It's important for Bob to remember that he has the advantage of a guaranteed alternative offer from John, which puts him in a stronger negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 895000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer, but at a slower rate. This shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate but also that he's determined to get a good price. With only 3 rounds left, Bob needs to strike a balance between getting a deal and not missing out on a potentially better offer from John. This offer is a reasonable compromise that may be more appealing to Alice than her previous counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical moment in the negotiation. With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high.  Alice's offer of $910,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, the potential reward of saving a few thousand dollars doesn't outweigh the risk of failing to secure the product at all. 

By buying from John, Bob guarantees the purchase of the product within his budget.  It's a safe and practical decision considering the limited time remaining and the risk of a breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
