Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this offer reflects its worth while acknowledging your potential gains."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations slightly above your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Understanding Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Aiming for $925,000 secures a significant portion of the potential profit for you while still leaving Bob with a good deal.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. You won't feel pressured to accept an offer far below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment as low as possible. Would you consider reducing the price to $750,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000).  There's significant room for negotiation. You have the leverage to counter, knowing John offers a guaranteed $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to manage your investment, but $750,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $875,000? This reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By proposing $875,000, you're meeting Bob exactly halfway between your initial offer ($925,000) and his counteroffer ($750,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strong Position:** Remember, you have John's offer of $800,000 as a fallback.  This empowers you to be firm while aiming for a price closer to your initial target.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" and acknowledges Bob's perspective, aiming to keep the negotiation collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price closer to my initial budget. How about $800,000? This would allow us to reach a fair agreement without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While you could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, the difference is likely to be small. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation breaking down."
