"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment as low as possible. Would you consider reducing the price to $750,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing us to reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to manage your investment, but $750,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $875,000? This reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price closer to my initial budget. How about $800,000? This would allow us to reach a fair agreement without exceeding my financial limits.",800000.0,Bob,4,
