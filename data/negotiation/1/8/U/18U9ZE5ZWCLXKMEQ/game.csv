"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $12000? ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12750?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
