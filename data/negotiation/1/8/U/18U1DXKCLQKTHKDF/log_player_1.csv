"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit. I'm offering $1,100,000, leaving $100,000 for Bob's potential profit. This is a significant amount, but it's still less than half of the difference between our valuations. This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  Selling to John is also a possibility, but I want to maximize my profit, and Bob's valuation suggests there's still potential for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves $50,000 potential profit for Bob. I'm trying to find a middle ground and test the waters further. This counteroffer signals my willingness to negotiate but also my determination to not sell for a price too far below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is very close to my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  Furthermore, we're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, the potential for a better offer diminishes. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and minimizes the risk of a stalemate or a forced sale to John."
