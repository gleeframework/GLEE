"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If the negotiation fails, Bob can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal, but also doesn't want to risk losing the product to another seller.  Offering $950,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This price is also significantly lower than the price John is offering, making it a better deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his counteroffer in the previous round.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product. However, he's still aiming for a price lower than Alice's offer and closer to his initial counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still striving for a favorable price."
