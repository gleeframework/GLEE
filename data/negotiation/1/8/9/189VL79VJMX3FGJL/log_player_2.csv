"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. Since Bob has a maximum budget of $12,000, there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a great starting point. However, my budget for this product is a bit tighter. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm still confident that you'll love this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9000. This is my final compromise, so I hope you can see the value in this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's within his budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential for a deal to fall through."
