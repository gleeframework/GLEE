"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it holds immense value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also emphasizing the potential value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1500000 is far too high for me. While I see the potential in this product, I'm only willing to pay $800000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. While I could accept and secure a sale, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to facilitate a deal. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is still a substantial amount but closer to Bob's initial offer.  I'm emphasizing the unique value of the product and framing the offer as a mutually beneficial compromise. This approach aims to push Bob towards a higher price point while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is not budging on his price. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum. I'll reject his offer again.  I'm still holding out hope that we can find a compromise, but I'm also getting closer to accepting John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, I'm still confident in the product's potential and believe it's worth more than $800,000. To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value and allows us to both walk away with a successful outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm highlighting the product's potential and emphasizing a ""win-win"" outcome to encourage Bob to accept. This round is crucial, as accepting John's offer is becoming increasingly tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $800000. It's a fair price for the product's potential, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm now facing a critical decision. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it falls significantly short of my minimum. I've lowered my price significantly, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  

Therefore, I'll accept John's offer of $1,000,000. This secures a sale at a price I'm comfortable with and ensures I don't waste any more time with a potentially fruitless negotiation."
