Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I think it's fair considering Bob values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum. Accepting this ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially ending with a lower price or a sale to John for $80."
