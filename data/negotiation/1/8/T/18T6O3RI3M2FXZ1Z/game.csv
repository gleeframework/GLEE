"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $7,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,500, which is $8,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
