Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Create Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer scenario, starting slightly below my minimum allows a small buffer if Bob attempts to negotiate down.

It's important to note that this is a single-shot negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John."
