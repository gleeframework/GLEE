Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the value I've placed on this product and its potential for your company. I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement.
