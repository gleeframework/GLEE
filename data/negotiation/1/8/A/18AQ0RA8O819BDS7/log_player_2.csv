"Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

The product is well below your maximum price of $150.  There's no reason to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the deal, especially since you can always buy from John."
