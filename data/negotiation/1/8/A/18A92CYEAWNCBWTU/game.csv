"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $122.50?  I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial.",122.5,Alice,3,
