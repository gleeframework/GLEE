"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant discount from what the product is worth to Bob, but it still gives me a good profit margin. I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning the value the product has for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $100. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than $80, it's still below my target profit margin. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target.  The $95 offer is a compromise, but it still gives me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $92 is getting closer to my goal, I'm confident I can get a bit higher.  The negotiation process is moving in the right direction, and I believe I can secure a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to go down to $93. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 93}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of slowly decreasing the price while still maintaining a profit margin. By offering $93, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also holding onto a reasonable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $93 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $89 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough spot, but I'm going to sell to John. While I was hoping to get closer to $90, Bob is getting too stubborn and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and it's better than risking a further decline in price with Bob or potentially ending up with nothing if we run out of rounds."
