"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $130 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down some, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I can do $125 for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  If that works for you, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
