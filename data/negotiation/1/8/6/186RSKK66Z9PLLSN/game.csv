"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return while still offering you a significant value. Let me know if you're interested!",1050000.0,Alice,1,
