"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great price for you, and it gets me closer to my target. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a much better price than $12,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point and leaves room for further negotiation.  Bob can still try to get a lower price, so rejecting the offer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
