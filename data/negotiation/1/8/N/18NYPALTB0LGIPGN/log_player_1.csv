{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is more than the $800,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still significantly above your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation if needed. 

This strategy allows you to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to come up to your desired price. If not, you have the option of either counter-offering or moving on to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $850,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price point."

Bob's offer:

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'll counteroffer one last time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
