Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing you closer to your ideal selling point. 
* **Time Value:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays.

By starting the negotiation at $145, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit from Bob and ensuring a sale at a price acceptable to you."
