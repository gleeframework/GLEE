``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum, and I believe I can get a better price.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12,500 to make this work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,200. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
