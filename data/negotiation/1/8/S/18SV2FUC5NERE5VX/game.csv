"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you being upfront about what you're willing to pay.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $10,500, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $10,000.  This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this out.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, and that's my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best price possible.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $9,800.  However, I'm sticking to my last offer of $9,900.  This is my final price point, and it reflects the value of the product.  If we can't agree on this, I'm willing to move on and sell it to another buyer.  It's up to you.",9900.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're sticking to your price of $9,900, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make one final offer of $9,700. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you.",9700.0,Bob,8,
