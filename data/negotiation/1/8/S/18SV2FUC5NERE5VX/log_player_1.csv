"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's high but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  $12,000 is a good starting point because it allows for a counteroffer from Bob without immediately making me feel like I'm going to have to accept his price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm not desperate and willing to negotiate further.

**Next Round Plan:**

I'll likely counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, maybe $11,000, and explain that I'm willing to negotiate but need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you being upfront about what you're willing to pay.  I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I'm lowering my price by $1,000 from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing the need for a fair price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm staying positive and encouraging further negotiation.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I'm demonstrating my flexibility by lowering the price, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price, especially since Bob stated this is his ""final"" offer.  This might be a tactic to try and get me to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm not showing desperation and maintaining my leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Round Plan:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $10,000, explaining that I'm willing to make a final concession but need to ensure I get a fair price. I'll emphasize the product's value and the fact that I have other options (selling to John)."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $10,500, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $10,000.  This price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight increase:**  I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not accepting his ""final offer"" without pushing back.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and my need for a fair price.
* **Emphasize finality:**  I'm indicating this is my final counteroffer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Highlight mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the deal as a win-win situation for both of us. 
* **Show confidence:**  By raising the price, I'm demonstrating confidence in the product's value and my ability to negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, and that's my final offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best price possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $9,800 is close to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. 
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price and get closer to $10,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing I'm not desperate to close the deal and maintaining my leverage in the negotiation.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  I'm aware that selling to John is always a possibility if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Round Plan:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $9,900, emphasizing that this is my final offer and that I'm willing to walk away if a fair price isn't reached. I'll also remind him that selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your offer of $9,800.  However, I'm sticking to my last offer of $9,900.  This is my final price point, and it reflects the value of the product.  If we can't agree on this, I'm willing to move on and sell it to another buyer.  It's up to you."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I'm showing I'm serious and that I'm not willing to negotiate further.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, which justifies my price.
* **Setting a deadline:**  I'm emphasizing the limited time and the possibility of selling to John. This adds pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm not lowering my offer any further, demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price.

**Next Round Plan:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $8,000 in the next round. I've come as far as I can with Bob, and it's time to secure the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're sticking to your price of $9,900, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make one final offer of $9,700. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:**  With only two rounds left, the time is running out for a successful negotiation with Bob.
* **Bob's offer is still low:**  $9,700 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob in the next round. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John will secure a guaranteed $8,000, which is higher than Bob's final offer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Given the limited time and the possibility of Bob rejecting my counteroffer, selling to John is the most sensible option to ensure a sale and avoid a potential loss.

I'm choosing to secure the sale with John and walk away from the negotiation with Bob."
