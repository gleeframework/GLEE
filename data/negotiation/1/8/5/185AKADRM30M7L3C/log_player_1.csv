Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get close to my desired price point. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer.
* **John as a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me confidence to negotiate without rushing. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget around $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. 
* **John as leverage:**  Having John as a backup option gives me confidence to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $14,000, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go all the way down to $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? This would still give you a good value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, hoping to sway his decision.
* **Clear expectation:**  I'm setting a firm price point to avoid further back-and-forth. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've secured a good price while accommodating his budget.
* If Bob rejects: I'll have to consider whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John.  My decision will depend on how strongly Bob seems to want the product and how much time I want to spend negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still aiming to keep the cost at $12,000. Could we possibly find a middle ground that would allow me to stay within my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $12,000 price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome for me. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely involve more back-and-forth, potentially taking up valuable time and energy. 
* **Guaranteed value:**  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly closer to my desired price and my minimum acceptable price.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to secure a price closer to $14,000, selling to John provides a quick and certain solution that ensures I achieve a satisfactory price for my product."
