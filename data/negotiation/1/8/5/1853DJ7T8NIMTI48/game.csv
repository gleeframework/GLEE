"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this transaction. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $750,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $787,500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",787500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  $787,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.
