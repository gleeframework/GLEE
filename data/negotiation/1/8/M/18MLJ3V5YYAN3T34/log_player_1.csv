Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets a $300,000 discount from the product's worth to him, and we make a profit of $100,000 more than John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product."
