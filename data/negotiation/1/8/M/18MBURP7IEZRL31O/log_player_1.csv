Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can find a price closer to its true worth to me. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and doesn't reflect the product's true value. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is far too low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value to you, and allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is still quite high for my liking, I am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. I propose a price of $825,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is within my minimum acceptable range and is a better deal than selling to John."
