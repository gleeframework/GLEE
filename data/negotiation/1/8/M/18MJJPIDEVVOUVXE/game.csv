"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I have to make a living, and $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $9500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to save some money, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11500. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11500, and I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not willing to pay $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to get this deal done. How about we try $10250? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make a bit more than $10250. I'm counteroffering at $11000, and I'll include the one-year warranty and maintenance package as before. This is my final concession, so I hope we can agree on this price.",11000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm not willing to pay $11000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,10,
