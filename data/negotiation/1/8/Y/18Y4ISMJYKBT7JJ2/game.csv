I'm excited to offer you this great product! I'm looking for $150 for it.,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not sure $100 is enough for me to consider selling. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's make this happen.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $110, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so how about $130 is not possible, but $135 is?",135.0,Alice,5,
