"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to consider my needs. However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000, considering the product's value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $875,000 for the product. This offer allows us to move forward while ensuring that both parties benefit from the transaction.",875000.0,Alice,3,
