Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to acquire the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
