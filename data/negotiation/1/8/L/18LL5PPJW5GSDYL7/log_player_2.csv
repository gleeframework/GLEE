"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I believe the product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** I'm aiming significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** I don't want to lowball too aggressively and offend Alice. My offer is still a reasonable profit for her. 
* **Prepared to Walk:** I'm okay with walking away if Alice rejects this offer. I have John as a backup option, even though it's not ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is budging, but we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $1,050,000 is better than John's offer, but I think I can do better.  I'll counter with a price closer to her new offer to signal I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $925,000?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($1,050,000) and my previous counteroffer ($850,000) but leans slightly more in her favor. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a significant discount.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** I'm using friendly language and framing the offer as a mutually beneficial ""compromise."" This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Alice to continue negotiating. 
* **Time Pressure (Implied):**  While I don't explicitly mention John, Alice knows I have other options. Each counteroffer subtly reminds her that she needs to make a compelling offer if she wants to close the deal."
