Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $12,000 gives me a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room to potentially compromise.
* **Value proposition:**  Highlighting the benefit to Bob (lower than his estimated value) and to me (above my minimum) creates a win-win scenario.
* **Open-ended question:** Encouraging Bob to respond with his thoughts rather than a simple yes/no keeps the conversation going and gives me insight into his intentions. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly below my initial offer and leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by countering Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not desperate and keeps the negotiation dynamic in my favor.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly above $9,000 to see if we can reach a compromise. I'll aim for something around $10,000 to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** This counter-offer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum and leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Value proposition:** I reiterate the benefits for Bob (still below his estimated value) and for me (above my minimum) to emphasize the win-win potential.
* **Open-ended question:** I encourage Bob to respond with his thoughts, keeping the conversation dynamic and allowing me to gauge his reaction.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further, accept John's offer, or keep negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise, close to my counteroffer and still above my minimum.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might walk away, and I could be stuck with John's offer of $8,000.
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting this offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and secures a decent profit for me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting the offer:** I'll accept Bob's offer of $10,000 and finalize the sale."
