{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is above your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for a higher price if he's willing to negotiate.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher opening price might scare Bob off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there's still room to negotiate and potentially earn more. By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a really great product, and I think you'll be happy with it at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
