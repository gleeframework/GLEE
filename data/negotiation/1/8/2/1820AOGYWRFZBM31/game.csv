"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your minimum value is $1,000,000, and it allows us both to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, and it's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
