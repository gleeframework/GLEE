Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that's above my minimum threshold and leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially negotiate further, but I'm always ready to sell to John for $100 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept it. Selling to John for $100 would be less profitable."
