Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as the product is worth at least that much to me. If Bob rejects this offer, I can immediately sell to John for the same amount. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still leaving room for potential negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit while acknowledging Bob's lower valuation. This allows for further negotiation, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount without risking a deal with John."
