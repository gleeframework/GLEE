"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $725,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to accept $680,000?",680000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're getting closer to the sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $715,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, I've got another offer for $800,000.  If you can do $700,000, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I think I need to go with the other offer.",700000.0,Bob,6,
