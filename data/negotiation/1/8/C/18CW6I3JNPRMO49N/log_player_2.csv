(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, but it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice or resorting to buying from John at your maximum budget."
