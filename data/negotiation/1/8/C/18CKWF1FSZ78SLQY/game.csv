"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which reflects its significant value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I need you to meet me at that price. I'm not willing to go any higher.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
