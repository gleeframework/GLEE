Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which reflects its significant value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a drastic loss. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or even sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I need you to meet me at that price. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I've already gone down significantly from my initial offer, and there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. Given the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, it makes more sense to secure that guaranteed higher price.  There's no point in risking a lower sale with Bob, especially with limited rounds remaining."
