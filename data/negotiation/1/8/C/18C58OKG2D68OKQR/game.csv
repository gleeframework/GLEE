"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
