"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

You're trying to save money, so accepting Alice's offer is not the best option. Buying from John is a good backup plan, but it's still better to see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice's offer is the best you've received so far. It's below your maximum limit and a good deal compared to buying from John."
