Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to buy it from you.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
