"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a solution.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  I'm getting closer to your price range, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get at least $8,250 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to you. I'm confident that we can come to an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close.  How about we split the difference one more time and land at $8,000 even?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
