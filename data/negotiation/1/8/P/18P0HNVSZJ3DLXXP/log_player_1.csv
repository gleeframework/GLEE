"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price of $8,000. I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  I'm getting closer to your price range, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not willing to go that low yet. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get at least $8,250 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to you. I'm confident that we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close.  How about we split the difference one more time and land at $8,000 even?  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's a good deal for both of us."
