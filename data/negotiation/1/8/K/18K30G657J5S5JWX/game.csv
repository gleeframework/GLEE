"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $10500?  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if that works for you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
