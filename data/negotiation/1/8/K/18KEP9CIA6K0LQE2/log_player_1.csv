"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts to signal that I'm open to negotiating further. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's value as possible, but still earn significantly more than my minimum.
* **Multiple Rounds:**  I'm prepared to engage in multiple rounds of negotiation to find a price we both agree on.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of the Plan B option with John, but I'm starting by focusing on getting the best deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $10,000 is better than my Plan B with John, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to pay more than my minimum, so I want to see if I can get him closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that's more favorable to me.
* **Staying Optimistic:** I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, given that he's willing to pay more than my Plan B."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product by mentioning a good deal.  This helps to maintain pressure on him to consider my offer.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer aims to close the gap between our desired prices while still exceeding my minimum requirement.

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Approach:** I'm using a gradual approach to negotiation, making small concessions to encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away too much too quickly. I'm still holding onto some leverage.
* **Keeping Plan B in mind:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $8,000, but I'm prioritizing getting the best possible deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This means I'm at risk of losing a significant amount of potential profit if I reject his offer.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  With only a few rounds left, I'm concerned that rejecting Bob's offer might lead to a stalemate or a lower offer in the future. 
* **Plan B safety net:** Even though this offer is less than ideal, I still have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which provides a safety net if I'm unable to close a deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000, accepting Bob's offer will still result in a substantial profit.
* **Avoid Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer risks losing the deal entirely or ending up with a lower price in subsequent rounds. 
* **Time Constraint:** With limited rounds remaining, I need to make a decision that balances profit with the risk of missing out on a deal."
