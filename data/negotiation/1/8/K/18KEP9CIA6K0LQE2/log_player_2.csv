"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $12,000, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Alternative:**  Buying from John for $15,000 is still a viable option. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's offer:** $12,000 is still too high, but Bob is showing interest.
* **Counteroffer:** $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and still within Bob's budget. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.

This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation, allowing Bob to potentially get a better price without immediately resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point, but represents a slight improvement from the previous round.
* **Alternative:**  Buying from John for $15,000 is still a viable option if negotiations with Alice fail.

While Alice is moving in the right direction, rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a more favorable price. It also demonstrates that Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,000 is better than before, but still not ideal.
* **Counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a compromise that meets halfway between Bob's previous offer and Alice's offer.  It shows Bob is willing to negotiate, but also maintains his goal of saving money.

This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about getting a deal, but also that he is not willing to overpay.  It sets the stage for a possible agreement in the next round."
