"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is far too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little, but that's still a bit high for my budget.  How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
