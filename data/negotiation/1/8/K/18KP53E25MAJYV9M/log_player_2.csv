Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice is coming down in price, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,400,000. It's better to secure the deal at this price rather than risk her becoming firmer in her position or me needing to go to John and pay full price."
