"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer. While $12000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to meet me at $14000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $13000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and close this deal at $13500. This is a great price for a product of this quality.",13500.0,Alice,5,
