"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  This is still a good price for you, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering I'm already paying above my initial budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",15500.0,Alice,5,
