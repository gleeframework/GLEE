"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,600,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  We frame the high price by emphasizing the product's ""immense value and potential."" This reinforces its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains positive and collaborative, indicating our willingness to negotiate. 
 
This strategy allows us to gather information about Bob's position while keeping our options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests he has room to move significantly. We should counter with a price closer to our target while still allowing for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection and Justification:** We politely reject Bob's low offer, stating it undervalues the product. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we create a sense of compromise, even though our proposed price ($1,400,000) remains significantly above his offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** We re-emphasize the product's potential to generate returns, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.

This strategy maintains a firm position while encouraging Bob to make a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $1,000,000? It's a fair offer, and ensures you still make a significant profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered his true valuation of the product. While it's tempting to accept, we still have negotiating room and time before considering John's offer. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  How about we settle on $1,150,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding and Acknowledgment:** We start by acknowledging Bob's position and appreciating his effort in the negotiation. This builds rapport and a sense of collaboration.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We make a significant concession by dropping to $1,150,000. This is a substantial move from our previous offer and puts pressure on Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Framing the Compromise:** We frame the offer as a balanced solution that considers both the product's value and Bob's ""budget considerations,"" subtly reminding him that we're making a concession.

This offer aims to close the deal quickly by providing a strong incentive for Bob to accept while still securing a price significantly above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close to what I can do. I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,050,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer, we are still significantly above our walk-away point with John.  We need to signal that we're firm but willing to negotiate in smaller increments now.  Let's see if we can get him closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're definitely getting close. I appreciate you moving in my direction.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  We start by acknowledging Bob's progress (""getting close"") and thanking him for moving towards our price.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This common negotiation tactic suggests a sense of fairness and compromise, even though it still favors us.
* **Finality:** By saying ""that feels like a fair compromise,"" we imply this is our final offer, encouraging Bob to accept.

We are now at a point where we are getting close to John's offer.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, we need to seriously consider taking John's deal in the next round or two."
