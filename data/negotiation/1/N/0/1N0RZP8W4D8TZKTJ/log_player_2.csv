Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're definitely getting close. I appreciate you moving in my direction.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

It's time to cut our losses. While Alice is getting closer to our desired price, we're running out of rounds. At this point, it's unlikely she'll go below $1,100,000, and we can get it for $1,000,000 from John. Buying from John guarantees we stay within our budget and don't risk missing out entirely."
