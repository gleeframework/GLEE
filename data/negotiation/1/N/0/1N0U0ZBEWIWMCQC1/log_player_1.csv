Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you're interested in. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it seem like you're willing to make a deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours and your guaranteed offer from John. This high price will help you understand how serious Bob is as a buyer and if he's willing to negotiate up significantly. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob. This allows you to be more firm in your pricing. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he immediately rejects the price, you can adjust it downwards. However, don't go below $15,000 as you have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
