{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also encourages Bob to counteroffer if he's interested but thinks the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,500? That's a good compromise and still leaves a bit of room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13500. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? That's a bit closer to my original offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,250 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over his initial offer. Accepting his offer allows you to earn more than your minimum and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
