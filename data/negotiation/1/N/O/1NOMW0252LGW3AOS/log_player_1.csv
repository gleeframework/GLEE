Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I won't accept a price that undervalues it. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $80. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it aligns with my floor price. It's better to close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
