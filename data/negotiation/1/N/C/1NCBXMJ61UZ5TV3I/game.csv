"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $70 is a bit too low for me, though. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get out of the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $75? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $80? It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",80.0,Alice,5,
