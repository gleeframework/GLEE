"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and it's still a great price for you, considering the value this product brings. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $920,000?",920000.0,Bob,4,
