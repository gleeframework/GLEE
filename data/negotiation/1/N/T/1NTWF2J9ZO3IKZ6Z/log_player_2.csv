(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and hopefully incentivizes Alice to come down in price. I'm leaving room for compromise in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $1,500,000. While it's closer than her first offer, I still have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal.  It's better to continue negotiating rather than accepting a price that's above what I'm willing to pay.  I have several rounds left to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to meet halfway.  This offer is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiations.  I'm aiming for a gradual approach to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still $50,000 above what I'm willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially with several rounds remaining. There's a good chance we can reach a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. It's my maximum budget and aligns with the price John is offering. If Alice rejects this, I will accept John's offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering we both have room to compromise and it's a better deal than the alternatives."
