"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to offer $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price that respects your value while giving me a significant savings. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $825000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $775000. This represents a significant savings for me while still allowing you a comfortable profit. I'm eager to finalize this deal and would like to see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
