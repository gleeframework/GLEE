Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to offer $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price that respects your value while giving me a significant savings. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
