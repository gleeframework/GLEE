``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals to Bob that you're serious about selling to him, but you're not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000).  It's worth continuing to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,125,000. This price reflects both the value of the product to you and my need to make a fair profit. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, it's still significantly below the product's worth to him. It's worth taking one more round of negotiation to see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue this discussion, but $1,080,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to you while allowing me to get a reasonable return.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,070,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offers are getting too close to John's offer.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation any longer, as the potential gains are minimal and the risk of a stalemate is high.  Selling to John guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
