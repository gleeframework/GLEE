"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob. He can save $3,500 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer and he'll end up paying John's full price. Accepting this offer is the most strategic move to ensure a successful purchase within his budget."
