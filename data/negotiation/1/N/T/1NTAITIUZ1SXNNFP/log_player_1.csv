Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,550,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us to finalize this transaction.
