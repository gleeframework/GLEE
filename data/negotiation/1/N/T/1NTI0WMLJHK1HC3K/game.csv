"Alice,  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is at $10,000.  Would you be willing to negotiate closer to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
