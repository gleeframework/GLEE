"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $13,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be open to discussing that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could we meet in the middle at $12,000? This product will bring you significant value, and I believe that's a fair price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still looking to pay closer to $11,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
