Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why:

* **$150 is a reasonable starting price:**  It's above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and conveys confidence in the product's value. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open. 

However, this is just the beginning!  The best strategy will depend on:

* **Your assessment of Bob's potential value:**  If you think Bob might be willing to pay significantly more than $100, you could start higher.
* **Your desire to close the deal quickly:**  If you want to avoid a drawn-out negotiation, you could start closer to $100. 
* **Your risk tolerance:**  Are you comfortable with the chance of Bob rejecting your offer, or do you want to minimize the risk of losing the sale?

Keep these factors in mind as the negotiation progresses, and adapt your strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. I am willing to pay $100 for it. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a potentially better price from Bob.  You can use the next round to explore a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to $125 to reflect the true value of the product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $112.50?"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **Compromise:**  It's a move toward Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Still profitable:** $112.50 is still above your minimum and a reasonable price point.
* **Clear communication:** The message is direct, states your reasoning, and proposes a specific price.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for more discussion, if needed.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose $105 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation:

* **Close to your minimum:** $105 is only $5 above your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  Bob has already made it clear that $105 is his maximum.  Pushing for a higher price risks losing the sale altogether.
* **Time consideration:**  The negotiation has already gone through a few rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale.

While a higher price would be ideal,  it's more important to secure a sale at a price that's still profitable for you.  Selling to John for $100 would be less profitable."
