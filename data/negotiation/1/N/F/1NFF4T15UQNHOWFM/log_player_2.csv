"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum, it leaves a lot of room for negotiation. 
* **You can likely get a better price.**  You have a clear advantage knowing Alice's minimum selling price ($800,000).
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you show Alice you're serious about getting a better deal and start the counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly above your minimum. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more than $900,000.  How about we split the difference and I'll accept $950,000?  That's still a great deal for you and closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** It's closer to your ideal price, and splitting the difference is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Buying from John would be more expensive.**  Paying $950,000 is still significantly less than John's price.
* **Further negotiation might be too time-consuming.** You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice has countered.  It's possible you could get a slightly better price, but it might not be worth the extra effort."
