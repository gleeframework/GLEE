"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for me. How about we start the conversation at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While we want to maximize profit, accepting such a low price in round 2 could set a bad precedent for the rest of the negotiation.  We have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to his valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,075,000. I believe this price reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Show Understanding:**  Acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Hold Firm:** We countered his lowball offer with a firm but fair price. We've come down slightly from our initial offer, but not drastically.
* **Highlight Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value reinforces the justification for our price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still significantly below our minimum and his perceived value. We need to show we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a substantial loss. Let's continue negotiating and see if we can nudge him closer to $1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Positive Tone:** Continue with a collaborative and understanding tone.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're making another small concession, but this time a smaller drop than before to signal we're approaching our limit.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob why he's willing to pay a premium. 

We're now in the middle ground between his offer and our desired price.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $960,000 to get this deal done.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $960,000 is still a significant amount below both our minimum and his perceived value.  We have four rounds left, and Bob is clearly motivated to purchase. Let's push a little further and see if we can close the gap."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are close! I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.  Let's close this deal!"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Create Urgency:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Introducing a ""final offer"" can encourage Bob to act now.
* **Meet in the Middle:**  We've strategically positioned our ""final offer"" at our absolute minimum acceptable price, which is also a fair compromise.
* **Encourage Closure:** We end with a positive and action-oriented statement to signal our desire to finalize the deal."
