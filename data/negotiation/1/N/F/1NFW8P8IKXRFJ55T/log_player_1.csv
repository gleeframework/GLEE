Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This ensures I'm getting a good price, while also leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay $130 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go down to $130. How about $135? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my initial offer of $130. It's a fair price for both of us. If you're unable to meet at that point, I'll consider purchasing the product from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is firm on $130. This is above my minimum, and selling to John would only yield $120. Accepting Bob's offer is the best financial decision in this situation."
