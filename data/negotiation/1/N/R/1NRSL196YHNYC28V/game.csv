"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can do $130, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to get the product without breaking the bank.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $127.50, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny!",127.5,Alice,5,
