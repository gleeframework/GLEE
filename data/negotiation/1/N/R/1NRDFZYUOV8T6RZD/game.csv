"Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1000000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price given the value of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product.  Let's make this deal happen!",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $1500000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still too high for me. Given my budget and the fact that I can buy the product from John for $1200000, I'm willing to offer you $1300000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
