,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 isn't quite enough for me.  This product holds exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit of a slightly higher investment.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1050000?  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your ongoing negotiation and we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I need to ensure this deal is mutually beneficial. How about $1000000?
