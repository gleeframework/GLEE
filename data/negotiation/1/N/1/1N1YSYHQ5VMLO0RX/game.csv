"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product for $800,000, which is my maximum offer. I believe this price is fair given the value I'm placing on the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me is still higher than that.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value I place on it and the fact that I'm prepared to purchase it now.  I believe this is a good compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us. I'm eager to finalize the sale, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",950000.0,Alice,5,
