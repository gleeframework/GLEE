{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it, though. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for less than $100.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $100."
