"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $110 is too low, and I still have time to negotiate with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $110 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go any lower than $125. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $115. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $120. I'll counter with a price that's more appealing to me but still within a reasonable range for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $120. This is my final price, and it's fair considering the product's value. It's a great deal for you, and I hope we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
