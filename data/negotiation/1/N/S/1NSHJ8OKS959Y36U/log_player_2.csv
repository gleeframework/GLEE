"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll agree that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. As we've both established, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a significant savings compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
