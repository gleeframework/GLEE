"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $15,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're close to your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",16000.0,Alice,5,
