"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the offer,  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  $850,000 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
