Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $175 is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** Briefly highlighting the product's value can help Bob see the potential.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer.
* If Bob doesn't respond, or the negotiation stalls, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob is interested, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet him somewhere in the middle.
* **John as a fallback:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, so I can afford to be more firm with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $125 but lower than my initial offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate but still protect my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This would still allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** $140 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not willing to settle for a price too far below my minimum acceptable. 
* **Reiterating Value:** The message highlights the value of the product and implies that I'm not simply willing to drop the price for any offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer still leaves room for Bob to counter again if he's still hesitant.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I will carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects again, I'll need to decide if I want to make another counteroffer or move on to John. 
* **Possible Scenarios:**
    * **Bob accepts:**  I'll sell the product to Bob for $140.
    * **Bob counters again:** I'll need to assess his new offer and decide how to proceed.
    * **Bob doesn't respond or negotiation stalls:** I'll sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $130.  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150. This provides me with a secure option that meets my minimum price requirement. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob may lead to more counteroffers and time spent, potentially lowering my final price or stalling the sale. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll politely inform Bob that I appreciate his interest but I've decided to sell the product to someone else.
* I'll contact John to finalize the sale for $150."
