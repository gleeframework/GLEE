"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  While I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he may be willing to pay a bit more, especially if he's interested in acquiring it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. It's still above Bob's offer, but it's a significant step down from my initial price, showing a willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still only one thousand dollars away from my desired price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer again and see if I can squeeze out a little more in the next round. I'm still willing to sell to John for $15,000 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt Bob into making a final deal. If he rejects again, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are too small to risk losing a guaranteed $15,000 from John. Bob's offer is getting closer, but I've already made concessions and I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that satisfies my minimum value.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
