"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. I believe this is a fair starting point considering my product's value to me is $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my ideal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate and walk away if necessary."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,600,000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, and that we can reach a deal this round. This price is still a significant profit for me, but I'm willing to continue to negotiate to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, but it's still too low. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round. I want to try to get at least $1,500,000 to avoid selling to John, who is only offering my floor price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is only $50,000 above John's offer, which is a price I'm comfortable with, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer.  It's unlikely he'll make a counteroffer that's higher than John's, so this is likely my last chance to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've only got two rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer in the next round, which is less than John's price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I'm not thrilled to be selling at my floor price, but it's better than getting less."
