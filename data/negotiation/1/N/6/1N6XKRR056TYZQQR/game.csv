"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair offer, considering its true value.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $11,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
