You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John. It makes sense to reject Alice's offer of $9,500 and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $8,000 price from John.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, but it's still above Bob's preferred price.  Since Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's more advantageous to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
