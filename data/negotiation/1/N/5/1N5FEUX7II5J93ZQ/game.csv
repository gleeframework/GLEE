"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $800,000 is closer, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? It's a fair compromise and a great price for you considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
