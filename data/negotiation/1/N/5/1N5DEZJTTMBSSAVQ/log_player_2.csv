"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, I understand its true worth to be $1,200,000. However, I am extending an exclusive offer to you at a price that reflects my confidence in its value to you, yet also allows me to ensure a fair profit. I propose to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This offer is valid for a limited time, and I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations, or if you require further information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's value to her ($1,000,000). While her offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you might:

* **Prompt a counter-offer:**  Alice might be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale. 
* **Stick with John:** You have a guaranteed backup option with John at $1,200,000. 

It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to your backup."
