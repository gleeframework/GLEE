"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500.  This still leaves me some room to profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
