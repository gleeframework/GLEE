"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

You should reject Alice's offer. $1,000,000 is still above your budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950000. This still allows you to make a profit, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Alice's counteroffer is lower, it's still above your budget.  You should reject and counteroffer again. There's a good chance you can get closer to your $800,000 target."
