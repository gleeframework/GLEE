"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'd like to make an offer at this price. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I have to be honest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10500 for the product. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession - I can do $10200. That's the lowest I can go. Can you consider that?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's my absolute maximum. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
