"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  

**Next Steps:**

Bob should counter with a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000, aiming to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Offering $900,000 is a compromise that reflects both his desire to save money and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a slightly higher price. How about $950,000? This still leaves you with a good profit and is closer to my asking price. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still better than John's:**  $950,000 is a better deal than $1,200,000 from John.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could try to counter again, it's unlikely Alice will drop much further.  The risk of a stalemate and having to buy from John is high.

**Conclusion:**

It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's."
