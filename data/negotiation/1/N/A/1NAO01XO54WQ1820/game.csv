"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, $1,100,000 is a significant step down from what I believe the product is worth. Could we perhaps meet in the middle, say around $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
