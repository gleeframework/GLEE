"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $12,500? This is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",12000.0,Alice,5,
