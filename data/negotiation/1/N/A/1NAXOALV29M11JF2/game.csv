"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000  to begin our conversation.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond $800,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it. Let's find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
