"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no need to pay more. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
