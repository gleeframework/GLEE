Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that John might be a better option... 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging much below $9,000. Her mention of John reinforces that she knows you have an alternative option. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield a price significantly better than John's $8,000 offer. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed saving."
