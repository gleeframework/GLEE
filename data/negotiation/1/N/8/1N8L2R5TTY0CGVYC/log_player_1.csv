Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is well above your minimum of $80, giving you a good starting point for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:** At $120, Bob still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you have room to negotiate and still get a good price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay $95 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is more than your minimum of $80, you can likely do better.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to your initial offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a little closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $105 for the product?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise. It's still above your minimum and closer to your initial offer, but it also demonstrates your willingness to negotiate. It shows Bob that you're taking his offer seriously and are willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice. You've already negotiated a price significantly higher than your minimum of $80.  While you could try to squeeze out another $5, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving you with the $80 offer from John. It's better to secure a deal that's good for you and avoid risking a lower price."
