"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. It's a bold move, but I'm aiming high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. I'm confident in the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see how much leverage I have."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for less than $900,000, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $875,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take the $850,000, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I've got a few rounds left and I think I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}

I'm dropping the price slightly to $860,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer but I'm still trying to maximize my profit.  I believe he is close to my target price and this offer may be enough to seal the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for a price that low.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can convince him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the time we've spent negotiating. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John. I'm running out of time, and I need to secure a sale soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'm not thrilled about getting my minimum price, I've reached the point where I'm running out of time and I need to secure a sale.  It's clear that Bob is not going to budge much further, and I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiations.  John is a reliable buyer and I'm confident that this deal will go through smoothly."
