"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you an idea of his level of interest and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. There's room for negotiation. Bob offering $12,000 right away suggests he might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below my asking price. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By coming down from $14,000, you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  The $13,000 counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob while still leaving some wiggle room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I am still unable to meet you at $13,000. I would like to propose $12,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $12,500 exceeds your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, securing a profit.
* **Limited Upside:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, especially since he's sticking close to his initial offer.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now avoids the risk of negotiations failing and having to settle for John's offer later."
