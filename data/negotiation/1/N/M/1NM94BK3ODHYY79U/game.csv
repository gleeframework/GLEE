"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider something closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me though. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, at $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
