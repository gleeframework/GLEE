Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget.  I'm really trying to stick to a price closer to $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and this offer exceeds my fallback option of selling to John."
