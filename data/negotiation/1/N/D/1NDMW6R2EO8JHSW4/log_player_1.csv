Round 2
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make at least $80 to make this worthwhile."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my goal, $77 is still too low. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
