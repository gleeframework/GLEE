Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $800,000, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $800,000, so I have a good safety net. 

This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob might value the product higher than $800,000 but less than $1,000,000. By setting a high price, I have a chance to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
