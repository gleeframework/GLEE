"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $800000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1000000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount for being a serious buyer. I can offer it to you for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $900000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $925000, which is a 5% discount from my previous offer. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
