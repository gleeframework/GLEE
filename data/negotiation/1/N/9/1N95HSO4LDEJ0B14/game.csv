"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's work together to find a solution.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to drop my price to $14,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $13,500?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
