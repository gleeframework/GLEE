"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $1300000? This represents a significant compromise from my previous counteroffer, and I'm confident this product will generate substantial returns for your business.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but $1220000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $1275000 as a final compromise.  This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident this product will generate substantial returns for your business.  Let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
