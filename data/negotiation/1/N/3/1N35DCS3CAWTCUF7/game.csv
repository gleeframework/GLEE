"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,400,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $1,625,000.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1625000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,625,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is closer to my limit.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can find common ground at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
