"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,400,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $1,625,000.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,625,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate further.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to bargain, or you can always choose to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
