Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value it holds, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, so it makes the most financial sense to sell to him."
