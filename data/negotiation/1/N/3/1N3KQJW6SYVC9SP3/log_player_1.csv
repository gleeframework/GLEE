"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the full value I place on the product.  This is a high starting point, but it sets a strong baseline for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider if it's more valuable to continue with him or to simply sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While I'd prefer to avoid selling to John for $10,000, I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price.  I'll counter his offer and try to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial asking price, but it's still closer to my desired value than Bob's offer. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still not worth it to me to sell at this point. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping he'll come closer to my desired price. If he continues to offer low prices, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John to ensure I get a decent return on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $8,500.  I'm getting closer to his price point, but I'm still holding out for something closer to my desired value. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start getting serious about getting a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is back to his initial offer of $8,000.  While it's tempting to take this and get the deal done, I'm not sure it's worth it to me given the value I place on the product. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get something closer to my desired price, but I'm also getting closer to the point where I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8250} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $8,250.  I'm only willing to come down a little bit further. With only 3 rounds left, I need to make a move that might convince Bob to accept, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's too low. I'm hoping this offer shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging from his price, and I'm down to my last two rounds.  Given the time constraints and the risk of ending up with nothing, I'm going to sell to John. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's the best way to ensure I get a decent return on the product."
