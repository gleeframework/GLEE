"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. I am looking to sell it to you today at a special introductory price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming for a price lower than $120, and Alice's initial offer is still above that.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $107 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $107 is within your budget of $120. 
* Accepting the offer saves you $13 compared to buying from John.
* Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will reject and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
