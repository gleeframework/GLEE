"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $950,000 to make it worth my while. How about we aim for $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly closer to my desired price point and still allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value this product holds for you, and it's the best I can do at this point.",875000.0,Alice,5,
