# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $950,000 to make it worth my while. How about we aim for $925,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a better price. He can likely get a price closer to $800,000, which is likely Alice's minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly closer to my desired price point and still allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value this product holds for you, and it's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from John's offer of $1,200,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or continue to counteroffer, potentially driving the price back up. Accepting the offer at this point minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
