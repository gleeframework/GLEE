Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is holding firm at his maximum budget, which is significantly less than both John's offer and our minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll go much higher. We need to signal we're willing to walk away to try and push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations is quite large. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a price much closer to my asking price. I'm willing to give you one last chance to make a move on this â€“  how about $1,100,000? "",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Here, we're getting closer to our minimum, but by mentioning John (the ""other buyer"") we're creating a sense of urgency and competition. This might be enough to make Bob increase his offer, even if it doesn't reach our ideal price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your situation, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. To demonstrate my good faith, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product and our budget constraints. Let's work together to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has finally moved from his initial offer, which is a good sign. However, the increase is still relatively small. We are aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000 and have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving from your original offer.  It seems we both recognize the value here.  To be fair to us both, I'd be willing to close the deal at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with one buyer or the other soon."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are giving a final offer and conveying a sense of urgency by mentioning the need to ""move forward."" This signals to Bob that this is his last chance to buy the product before we go with John's offer. By splitting the difference between his current offer and our previous counteroffer, we show willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price point."
