"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $10000 to us, but we're willing to negotiate. Considering its value to you, let's start with a price of $9500. This gives us a bit of flexibility in case you need to adjust your budget.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility, but $9500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, how about we consider a price of $9200 for the product? This still allows for some negotiation room while being closer to your proposed amount.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9200 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $9100?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",9100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. We're glad to continue the discussion. Considering your proposal, how does $9150 sound for the product? This is slightly above your offer but still below our initial asking price, aiming for a fair compromise.",9150.0,Alice,5,
