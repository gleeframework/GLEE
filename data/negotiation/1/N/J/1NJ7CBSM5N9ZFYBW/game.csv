"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a significant discount and allows you to get a great deal. Let's finalize this.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
