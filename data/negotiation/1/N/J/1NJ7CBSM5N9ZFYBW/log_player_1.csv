Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,093,750. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm starting to run out of time. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, it's clear that Bob's not willing to meet me halfway.  To avoid risking losing the deal entirely, I'll sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than losing out completely."
