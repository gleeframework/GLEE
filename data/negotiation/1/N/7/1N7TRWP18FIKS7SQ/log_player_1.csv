Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so any price below that gives him a surplus.
* **My value:** I value the product at $8,000, so any price above that gives me a profit.
* **John's offer:** John is a safety net, ensuring I won't lose money if Bob rejects my offer. 

By offering $9,500, I aim to:

* **Maximize my profit:** It's a good price for me, earning $1,500 more than my minimum value.
* **Increase the chances of acceptance:** It's a fair price for Bob, giving him a $500 surplus."
