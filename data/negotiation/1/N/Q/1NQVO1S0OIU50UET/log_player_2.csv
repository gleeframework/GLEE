"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's valuation of the product, making it more likely she will accept. This also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a price closer to Alice's valuation, but higher than his ideal.  This demonstrates that Bob is serious about making a deal, but also trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer again, and it's now very close to what Bob would pay John.  The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and it's likely Alice won't budge much further. To avoid further negotiation and the risk of an even higher offer from Alice, Bob should buy from John, ensuring a known price within his budget."
