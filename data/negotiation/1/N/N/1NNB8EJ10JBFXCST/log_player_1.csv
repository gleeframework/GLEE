Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable price point that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides Bob with a clear benefit (a potential savings of $30) for accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than $80, it's still below the value I'd like to get for the product. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $105 is a good compromise and significantly higher than selling to John. It's time to close the deal and move on."
