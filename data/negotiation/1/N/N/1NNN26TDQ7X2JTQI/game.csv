"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While it's tempting, I'm really looking to stay under $10000 for this product. Would you be willing to come down to $10500? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm not quite ready to go down to $10500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
