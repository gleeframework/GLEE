"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum price of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price. You can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While it's tempting, I'm really looking to stay under $10,000 for this product. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm not quite ready to go down to $10500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your maximum price of $10,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will continue to hold out for a higher price. At this point, buying from John for $10,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget."
