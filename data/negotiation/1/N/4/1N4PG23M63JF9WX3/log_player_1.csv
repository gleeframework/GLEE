Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, getting the best possible price from Bob is ideal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,150,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds pressure for Bob to make a decision.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value, while still leaving room to accept John's offer if necessary."
