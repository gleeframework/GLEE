"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $15000, so you have a chance to secure it for a bit more. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product. Alice's offer is $16,000, which is more than you are willing to pay. Since you have another option to buy from John for $15,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
