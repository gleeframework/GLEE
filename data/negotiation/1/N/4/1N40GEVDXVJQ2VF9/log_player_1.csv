Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you're making more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  You're not starting at your highest possible price, demonstrating flexibility. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $13500.  Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is a bit lower than your initial offer, it's still above your minimum of $12,000 and within a reasonable range of your desired price. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiations."
