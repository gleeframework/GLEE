"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I think it's a fair price given its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows him to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
