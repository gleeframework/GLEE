"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better deal.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, but it's worth a shot to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. It's a bold move, but it could potentially lead to a successful negotiation. If Alice rejects, Bob can always increase his offer slightly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $1,000,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a favorable price without risking further negotiation and potential rejection from Alice."
