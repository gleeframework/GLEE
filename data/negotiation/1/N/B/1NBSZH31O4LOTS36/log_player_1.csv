{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price but still offers a potential profit for you. It also leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, you have the option of making a counteroffer or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I won't get a significantly better offer from him.  $10,250 is a good deal for both of us."
