Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate without losing money.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $150, so you have room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value can encourage him to accept, especially if he finds the product valuable. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while ensuring you're still likely to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to your minimum price of $150, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting his counteroffer, you demonstrate that you're not desperate to sell and are willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Potentially get a better price:**  You can make a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between $130 and your desired price. 
* **Explore John as an option:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, you can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $135? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  By offering $135, you're showing willingness to compromise and making the deal more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:**  $135 still allows you to make a profit, exceeding your minimum price of $150. 
* **Encouraging a quick deal:**  Presenting a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price may incentivize him to accept and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $132.50? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really like the product and think it's worth it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $132.5 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum price of $150.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Close the deal:**  This avoids further negotiations and ensures a sale.
* **Secure a profit:** $132.5 still yields a profit, which is better than risking further negotiations that could potentially lead to a lower price or a failed sale.
* **Minimize the risk:**  Since John is willing to buy for $150, I'm not losing much by accepting this offer.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale while minimizing the risk of the deal falling through or getting a lower price."
