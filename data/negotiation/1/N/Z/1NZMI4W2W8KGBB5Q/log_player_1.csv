Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its overall worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, it's always best to try and secure a higher price. 
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, but this doesn't limit our offer. We know its true value is much higher.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant potential profit margin while still remaining within a reasonable range above Bob's perceived value.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for some negotiation with Bob if he attempts to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
