Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $149 is just below your guaranteed sale price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal."" 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While not implemented here, this initial offer could potentially leave room for Bob to counter-offer, still landing within a profitable range for you."
