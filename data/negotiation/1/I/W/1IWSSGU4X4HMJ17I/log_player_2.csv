"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far too high. It's way over your maximum budget of $8,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get Alice closer to my $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go higher than $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still outside my ideal price range.  Since Alice has stated this is her final concession, I don't think further negotiation will lead to a better deal.  It's better to cut my losses and purchase the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures I stay within my budget and avoid any further potential haggling."
