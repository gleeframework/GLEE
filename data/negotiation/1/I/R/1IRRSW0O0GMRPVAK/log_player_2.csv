"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upward while still potentially securing a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will gauge Alice's flexibility.  If she's completely unwilling to budge from the $900,000 range, it might be more efficient to move on to John.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important, even when negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice has moved closer to my price, she's still significantly above my ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation.
* **Leverage:** I know Alice is motivated to sell, and I have a backup option with John. This gives me some leverage. 
* **Target in Sight:** I'll aim for a counter-offer closer to my $800,000 target, but I need to be prepared for Alice to push back."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a point where I can make this work, but I'd need it to be a bit lower. How about $775,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me."", ""product_price"": 775000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer ($850,000) and my previous offer ($700,000). It shows willingness to compromise.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:** I'm getting close to my $800,000 limit. If Alice doesn't move significantly in the next round, I'll likely take John's offer.
* **Maintaining Communication:** Continuing to engage in negotiation signals my interest while pushing for a more favorable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear that you're getting closer to a decision. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While not ideal, $825,000 is only slightly above my $800,000 limit. 
* **Alice is Firm:** Her message indicates this is her final offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price.
* **Saving Time and Effort:**  Continuing to haggle over a relatively small difference might not be worth the extra time and effort. Accepting now secures the product."
