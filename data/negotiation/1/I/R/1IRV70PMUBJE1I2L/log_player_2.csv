"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe has immense potential. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you its value is well over $1000000. I'm willing to let you acquire it for a significantly lower price than that. Are you interested in exploring this further? If so, I'd be happy to discuss the details and present you with an offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and buy from John for $1,000,000."
