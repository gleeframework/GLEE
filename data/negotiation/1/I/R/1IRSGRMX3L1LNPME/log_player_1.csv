Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,500,000) than it is to you.
* **Information Asymmetry:**  Bob doesn't know about John, your guaranteed sale at $1,000,000. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation creates a strong incentive for him while still netting you a significant gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,400,000 reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Acceptable Price:** $1,400,000 is a substantial profit for you (almost your minimum doubled!) and still saves Bob $100,000 compared to his valuation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (without revealing John specifically) encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If you value a long-term relationship with Bob, a slightly lower price might be strategically beneficial.
* **Negotiation Style:** This offer assumes a direct approach. You could start higher and allow room for negotiation if you prefer."
