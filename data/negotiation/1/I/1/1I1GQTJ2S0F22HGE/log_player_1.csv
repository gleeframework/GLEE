"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable addition to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000, reflecting the value you see in the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $8,500 is still too low. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $8,500 is still below my bottom line. To make this work for both of us, I'm prepared to offer the product for $9,500. This price reflects the value you've expressed and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we settle on $9,000 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good compromise! While I'd prefer a higher price,  $9,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and getting a deal done is important. It's also a good outcome for Bob since he's getting the product for a price he's willing to pay."
