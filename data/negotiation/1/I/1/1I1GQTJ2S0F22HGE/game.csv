"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000, reflecting the value you see in the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $8,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. While I value our ongoing negotiation, $8,500 is still below my bottom line. To make this work for both of us, I'm prepared to offer the product for $9,500. This price reflects the value you've expressed and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to adjust, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we settle on $9,000 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
