Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. Can we meet at $1,030,000? This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're reaching the limit:**  Alice has indicated this is her lowest price.  Further haggling might make her less willing to negotiate.
* **Good deal:** $1,030,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more savings and risks losing the deal altogether."
