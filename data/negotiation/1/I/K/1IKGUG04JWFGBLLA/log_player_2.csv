"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason: You can get the product from John for $10,000, so you have room to negotiate with Alice. You don't want to pay $12,000 when you can get it cheaper elsewhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: You are still better off buying from John for $10,000 than accepting Alice's offer of $11,500. There's still room to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. This is a fair price considering both our valuations of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason:  While Alice has lowered the price to $11,250, it's still higher than what you can get from John. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  It's more efficient to buy from John and secure the product for $10,000."
