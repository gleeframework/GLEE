"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget of $8,000.  It's time to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford $8,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  This still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. $14,000 is still above his budget of $8,000, even though it's a compromise. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,000 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  That's a significant drop from your previous offer and would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $12000 for this product. Let's find a compromise at this price. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down to a price closer to his desired $8,000. He has a few rounds left and there's no need to rush into a deal that is still outside his target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm getting closer to your price, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If you're serious about selling, this might be the best deal we can reach. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  I'm willing to go down to $11500 for this product. This is a good price for you and a fair deal for me.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice is getting closer to his desired price, $11,500 is still above his budget.  With a few rounds remaining, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. He can try to push for $11,000 or even a little lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a little out of my reach.  I'm firm on $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while now."", ""product_price"": 11000}
