Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115** is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and positive, aiming to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This approach balances getting a good price with maintaining the potential for a successful negotiation.  It allows for:

* **Flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can adjust your price downward in subsequent counteroffers. 
* **Potential for higher price:** If Bob is eager for the product, he might be willing to accept your initial offer.
* **Safety net:** The option to sell to John for $100 ensures you won't lose out entirely if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$105 is still a good price for Bob, and you can likely get closer to your desired price.** You are already getting a good price from Bob, but you might be able to get closer to your $115 target by countering his offer. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer gives you more leverage in the negotiation.** By showing that you're willing to stand firm on your price, you're more likely to get Bob to compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, like $110. This shows flexibility while maintaining the potential for a higher price.
* **Keep John in mind:** Selling to John is always an option if the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes too unfavorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This still gives you a great price for the product, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110 is a compromise:** It's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a good price for me.
* **Positive message:**  I maintain a friendly and positive tone, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Staying firm but flexible:**  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I have a clear value for the product.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've achieved a good outcome.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll have to consider if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if selling to John for $100 is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110.  However, I'm still a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $108, which would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$108 is close to my minimum price:**  While I would prefer $110, $108 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for future deals with Bob:**  Accepting this offer might lead to future business with Bob if he finds the product valuable.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure the sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a rejection.
* **Focus on the long-term:**  Building a relationship with Bob might lead to more profitable transactions in the future. 

**Reasoning:**

* While a higher price is always desirable, the value of a potential future relationship with Bob outweighs the $2 difference.
* Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether and potentially having to sell to John for $100."
