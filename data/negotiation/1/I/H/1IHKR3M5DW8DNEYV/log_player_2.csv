# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,100,000, which is lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $100,000 compared to buying from John.

Even though the product is worth more to you ($1,200,000), it's still a good deal to accept Alice's offer since you are saving money and still getting the product for a price you are willing to pay."
