Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit while still being a strong offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Initial Impression:** A confident initial offer can encourage Bob to take the deal seriously.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing for certain that John will buy the product for $800,000 if Bob declines. If that deal is uncertain, Alice might be more inclined to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob."
