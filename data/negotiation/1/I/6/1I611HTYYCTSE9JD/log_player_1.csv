Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Even though Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000.  Starting with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially a better outcome.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price (even if vague about ""value"" and ""interest"") can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is phrased to encourage a response from Bob, giving Alice insight into his potential interest and flexibility. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, Alice can always negotiate down, but she shouldn't go below her minimum of $15,000."
