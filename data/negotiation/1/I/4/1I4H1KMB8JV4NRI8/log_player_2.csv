"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get it for less than $15,000, which is what John will sell it to you for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice's offer is still too high, and you might be able to get it for closer to your desired price.  John is a good backup option, but it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

This offer is closer to Alice's last offer and shows you're willing to compromise, but it's still below your maximum.  Hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."
