"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the sale.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I acknowledge the product's value,  $925,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000,  which is a significant step towards your asking price and a more realistic price point for me. Let's find common ground here and close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
