"Thank you for the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $80 right now. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90. This is my best offer, so let me know if you're willing to work with me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go.",100.0,Alice,5,
