Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that considers its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  That reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and represents a fair deal for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,450,000. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. My final offer is $1,350,000. If that works for you, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.

I'm not comfortable accepting Bob's final offer of $1,350,000. It's too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price from John."
