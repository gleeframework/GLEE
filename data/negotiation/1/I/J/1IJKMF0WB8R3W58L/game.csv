,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that considers its value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  That reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,450,000. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value for the product.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate the compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. My final offer is $1,350,000. If that works for you, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
