Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves you room to negotiate down to your minimum of $10,000 if necessary, or potentially even higher.
* **It shows confidence:** Starting with a strong offer shows you believe in the product's value.

Remember, this is just the initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired amount. However, there's still room to negotiate with Bob, as he has shown interest.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially getting closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired amount.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, and I'm confident I can get closer to that price with John, who is already willing to pay that amount.  However, Bob has shown some flexibility, and I don't want to lose him as a potential buyer. I'll counter with a lower offer but still aim for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $9,250? This price reflects the value of the product while also considering your budget. Let's close this deal and make it work."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,900. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident I can get a better price from Bob.  

Selling to John guarantees me my desired amount and avoids further negotiation with Bob. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
