"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to my budget. How about $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a compromise at $110. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you $105, which is still a good price for this product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
