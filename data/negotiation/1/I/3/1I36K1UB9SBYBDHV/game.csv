"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $925000? It's a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? It's a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'll offer you the product for $912500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our willingness to compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",912500.0,Alice,5,
