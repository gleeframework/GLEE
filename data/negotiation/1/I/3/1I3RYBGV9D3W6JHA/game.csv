"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I'm sure we can reach a deal that works for both of us. Let's find a common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
