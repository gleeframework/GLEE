{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal while still allowing me to make a significant profit.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and focuses on mutual benefit. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product has value, and this price reflects that.
* **Positive tone:**  The message stays friendly and focused on finding a solution. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm still aware of the $1,500,000 offer from John, but I'm trying to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,250,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  While John is a sure thing for $1,500,000, I'm close to finding a middle ground with Bob.  
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is a final counteroffer,  bringing the price closer to Bob's last offer while still being above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** The message highlights the fact that this is a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive and decisive tone:**  I'm showing a willingness to close the deal while also being firm about my bottom line. 
* **Ready to walk away:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so if Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:**  While Bob has come up slightly, $1,280,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation stalemate:** We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price for me.
* **John is a secure option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

I've decided to take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,500,000.  While I would have liked to get a little more,  I don't want to risk a prolonged negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price or a failed deal."
