I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for a product of this quality and value.

You are very close to your target price with John.  One more counteroffer to Alice could get you a lower price than John, so rejecting the offer and sending one more counteroffer is the best option."

While Alice's offer of $892,500 is tempting, it is still above your desired price range.  It is now time to cut your losses and purchase the product from John for $800,000.  You will save more money by purchasing from John rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
