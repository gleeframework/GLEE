"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. My counteroffer is $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay a good price for the product, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for a product of this quality and value.",885000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you need to get a good price for the product, and I appreciate your flexibility.  $885,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to offer $880,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know your decision.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've been patient and flexible, Bob, but I think we've reached the point where I need to prioritize getting the best price for the product. Your offer of $880,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $892,500. This is my absolute last offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",892500.0,Alice,7,
