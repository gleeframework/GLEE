"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for a price lower than you anticipated. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds, and John is willing to pay my minimum. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least close to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you need a fair price. How about we settle at $1,175,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I think it represents a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,175,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the remaining rounds. Also, I know John is waiting in the wings, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less than my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,175,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to sell the product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
