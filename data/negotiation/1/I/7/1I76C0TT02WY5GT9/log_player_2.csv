"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to Bob, so he should reject Alice's offer of $140 and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $125. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  I'm still willing to work with you to find a price we're both happy with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating. While $135 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to get it lower.  There are many rounds left, and he has the option to buy from John at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, so I'm going to offer $130. This is my final offer before I go with John's deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you sticking with me and your offer is getting closer.  However, $130 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me.  Would you consider $133? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to avoid having to go with John's offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $133. He's already stated that $130 is his final offer before going to John, so accepting $133 is a reasonable compromise. He's saving $7 compared to John's price, and it's likely that further negotiations with Alice will result in a price closer to $130, making this a good opportunity."
