{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my value of $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. This offer is high enough to potentially be attractive to Bob, but low enough to leave room for a counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also well below the value the product holds for me.  I'll counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  How about $8,500? That's a significant reduction from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is still above Bob's valuation of $8,000, but it's a substantial drop from my initial offer and shows my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired range.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to $12,000, but I'm prepared to sell to John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.  How about $8,000? That's a fair compromise and a significant drop from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,000. This price is exactly at Bob's valuation, so it's a good compromise.  It's still significantly higher than Bob's previous offer, but it shows my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John at $12,000, as I'm not willing to go much lower."
