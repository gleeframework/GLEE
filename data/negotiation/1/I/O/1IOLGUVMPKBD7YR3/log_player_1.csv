"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we possibly agree on $1,200,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer now matches John's offer. While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting the $1,200,000 ensures we get a fair price and avoid potentially losing the sale."
