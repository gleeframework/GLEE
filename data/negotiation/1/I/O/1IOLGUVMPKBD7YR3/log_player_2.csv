"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?
