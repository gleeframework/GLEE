"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we possibly agree on $1,200,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
