Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a ""great deal"" you are framing the offer as a win-win scenario for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and get something, it's not worth the risk.  I can counteroffer and try to get closer to my goal.  If I don't succeed, John is a guaranteed sale for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8800? It's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm close to my goal, I'm not willing to risk a lower sale.  Since John is a guaranteed sale for a higher price, I'll take the safe option and sell to him."
