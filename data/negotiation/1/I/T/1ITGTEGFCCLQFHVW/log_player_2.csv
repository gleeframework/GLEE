"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $10000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a fair price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, accepting Alice's offer of $10,500 would exceed his budget.  Therefore, rejecting her offer and buying from John for $10,000 is the better option."
