Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $75, which would be $78.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78.5. 
You have three options:

While I could try to negotiate further, $78.50 is a reasonable price and a decent compromise. It avoids the risk of Alice walking away or me having to settle for John's higher price."
