Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about $1,675,000? This price is still fair considering the value of this product to you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,675,000
