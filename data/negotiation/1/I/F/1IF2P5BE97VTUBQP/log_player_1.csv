Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed offer from John, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob above his perceived value but below John's offer leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,300,000 is strategically placed:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's valuation, creating the impression of the product's high value.
    *  Lower than John's offer, providing Bob with a potential ""deal."" 
* **Positive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the high price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  We achieve a profit higher than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for a counter-offer, and we can negotiate closer to our desired price, potentially still exceeding John's offer.
* **Bob Rejects:** We accept John's offer, securing the guaranteed $1,500,000."
