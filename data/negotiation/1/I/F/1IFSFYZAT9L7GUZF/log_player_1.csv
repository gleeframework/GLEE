{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value of the product and leaving the door open for further discussion. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a higher price. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response and the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  This allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Selling to John:**  This is always an option, but I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially considering he's already expressed interest.  I believe I can get closer to my desired $1,200,000 with further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, acknowledging Bob's desire for a good price while emphasizing the product's value.  This approach aims to keep the negotiation open and respectful. 

My goal is to stay within a range that keeps Bob interested while moving closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

**Explanation:**

While $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I am confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially considering he's already expressed interest.  I believe I can get closer to my desired $1,200,000 with further negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm ready to make a final concession.  I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and ensures both of us get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a final concession by dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is still above Bob's last offer but closer to his budget, indicating a genuine attempt to reach an agreement.
* **Fair Price:** I'm framing this price as fair to both parties, highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Decision Point:**  This offer is a clear signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. If he rejects, I'll likely move forward with selling to John. 

My goal with this counteroffer is to find a compromise that maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to John."
