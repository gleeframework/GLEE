"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price.  While buying from John is an option, it's the most expensive and should be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum value. This gives Alice an incentive to negotiate further while leaving room for you to potentially secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to potentially secure a price closer to your ideal target of $8,500. Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. It's still below Alice's current offer, suggesting you're serious about negotiating a lower price. This keeps the negotiation moving while leaving room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $250 more than your last counteroffer, and it's significantly lower than John's offer. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you the product at a price you can afford, and it's likely that further negotiations will not result in a significantly better price."
