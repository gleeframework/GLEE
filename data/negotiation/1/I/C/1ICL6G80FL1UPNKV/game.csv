"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns could far exceed this price. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. However, if this price isn't suitable for you, I have another buyer lined up. ",2000000.0,Alice,1,
