"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns could far exceed this price. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. However, if this price isn't suitable for you, I have another buyer lined up.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
