Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns could far exceed this price. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. However, if this price isn't suitable for you, I have another buyer lined up. "", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000, knowing I have a safety net of $1,500,000 from John. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I mention the product is ""unique"" and could be of ""great value"" to Bob. This  piques his interest without revealing too much about the product's specifics.
* **Negotiation Space:**  By saying ""if this price isn't suitable,"" I open the door for potential negotiation. Bob might counteroffer, and I can then adjust based on his response. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning John creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to take the offer seriously.

This strategy balances maximizing my potential earnings with ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
