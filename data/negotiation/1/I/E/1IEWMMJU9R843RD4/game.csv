"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1500000.  While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product, I'm confident it can be a game-changer. I'm willing to let you acquire it for a price of $2000000. This is a significant discount given the potential value I see. Please consider this offer carefully.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up for $1500000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
