"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still significantly below Alice's asking price but also comfortably above her valuation.  This gives us room to negotiate while signaling that I'm serious about buying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,250,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This still leaves you with a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for me.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $1,350,000 is still above the midpoint between our initial offers. There's room for further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a better agreement."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle on $1,300,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm inching my offer up slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a price that's advantageous for me. This offer is closer to the middle ground and might be tempting for Alice to accept."
