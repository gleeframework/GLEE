"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save money, and $120 is still a decent amount for a product you value at $150. You have room to negotiate, so rejecting the offer allows you to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower counteroffer allows you to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $100 is a significant drop from her initial offer and might entice her to accept, especially since you are prepared to go to another seller if the deal doesn't work out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is only $10 more than your initial counteroffer.  This is a good price, considering your maximum budget is $150.  It's better to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a higher price or having to buy from John at a higher cost."
