Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  A price of $950,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value than John's offer, increasing the likelihood of a sale at a higher price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a price closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Minimizes risk:**  Even if Bob rejects, you have a guaranteed sale to John, ensuring you get at least $800,000."
