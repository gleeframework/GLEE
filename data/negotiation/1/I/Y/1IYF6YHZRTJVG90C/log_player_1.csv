Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must respectfully decline at this price. I am now offering $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering my financial situation.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is the most strategically sound option at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and a substantial profit over what John is offering.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations delays receiving payment. The sooner I close the deal, the sooner I can utilize those funds.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer more in subsequent rounds.  He might become frustrated and walk away, leaving me to accept John's lower offer."
