Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle on a price higher than $8,000.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed politely to encourage a positive response and potential negotiation."
