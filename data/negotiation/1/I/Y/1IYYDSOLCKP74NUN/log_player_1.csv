Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially prevents him from shopping around too much.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows for a more aggressive opening offer to Bob."
