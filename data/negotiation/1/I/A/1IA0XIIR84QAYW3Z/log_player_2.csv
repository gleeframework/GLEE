**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,200,000
* **Your Maximum Budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's Price:** $1,500,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer guarantees a purchase within your budget and secures a better price than John's."
