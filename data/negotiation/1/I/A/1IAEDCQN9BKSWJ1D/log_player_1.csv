Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $13,500 is higher than Bob's $12,000 value, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** It's significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000, giving me some wiggle room if Bob counters. 
* **It shows I'm open to negotiation:** By offering a price, I'm inviting Bob to engage and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to quickly start the negotiation while leaving space to adjust if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested, and his offer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial value. 
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum:** While Bob's offer is tempting, selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and potentially more if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have a chance to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're keen on the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $13,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** I'm holding firm on my minimum value, which is higher than Bob's offer.
* **Offer a compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on finding a middle ground:**  This approach is likely to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. 

This counteroffer allows me to explore a potential compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit."
