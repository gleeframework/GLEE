Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering the product at $100, which is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""It's a great deal for both of us,"" I'm implicitly acknowledging that the price might be negotiable.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below the $120 I could get from John. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price. 

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a price lower than my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message is friendly and conveys a sense of collaboration, encouraging Bob to consider the counteroffer. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I mention the ""value of the product"" to remind Bob of its worth and justify the price.

By making this counteroffer, I aim to find a middle ground that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's made a concession, his offer of $87.5 is still below my minimum value of $120. 
* **Time is money.** Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a higher price, but it could also take time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might refuse any further offers, leaving me with a product I can't sell for a price I'm comfortable with.

By choosing to sell to John, I secure a certain profit and avoid the uncertainty and potential loss of continuing negotiations with Bob."
