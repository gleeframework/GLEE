"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $87.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",87.5,Bob,4,
