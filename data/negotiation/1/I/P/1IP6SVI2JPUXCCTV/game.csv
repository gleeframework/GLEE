"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is significantly below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? This still gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137.50 is still outside of my budget. I'm happy to pay $115 for the product, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $125?  It's still a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $120, and I think that's a good compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen!",120.0,Bob,6,
