Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the true value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation.
