Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting high gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at broader value and potential competition, aiming to justify the high price without revealing our hand completely.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** We don't want to scare Bob off entirely. By starting high, we signal a willingness to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still having a good chance of securing a deal with Bob."
