{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable price that's above your minimum, giving you room to negotiate if necessary.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below your minimum price. You want to see if you can get closer to your target.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and hopefully secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is now above your minimum of $100.  While it's still lower than your initial ask, it's a reasonable compromise and you can accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiations."
