Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate towards my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $10,000. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to me and the possibility of selling it to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can secure a higher offer from Bob or, if necessary, sell the product to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a final compromise, as it's just above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll be ready to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm confident that John's offer is the best option at this point. Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price or a prolonged process, and I'd rather secure a sale for a fair amount."
