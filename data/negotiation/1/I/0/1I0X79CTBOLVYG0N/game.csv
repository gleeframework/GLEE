"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  This product would be useful to me, but I have a budget in mind. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle on $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still too high for me. Perhaps we can find a price that works for both of us? How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial and $7,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a firm budget.  I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's my absolute limit. ",7500.0,Bob,6,
