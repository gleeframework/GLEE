"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This demonstrates his strong desire to save money and sets the stage for negotiation. This price is also a bit lower than what Bob would pay John, leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While it's closer to Bob's limit, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise. This is a strategic move as it keeps the negotiations moving while still staying within his budget. The offer is close to what Bob would pay John, so there's not much more room for him to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still above what he's comfortable paying. It's clear that the negotiation isn't going to get him a price much lower than that, and the time is getting short.  Since John is offering the product at $1,000,000, it's a safer bet for Bob to secure the product from John and save himself the risk of further negotiation."
