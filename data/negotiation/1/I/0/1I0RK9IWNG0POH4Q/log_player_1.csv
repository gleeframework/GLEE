{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but is still lower than my minimum price. This is a good starting point because it allows for some room for negotiation, and it shows Bob that I am willing to be flexible. I also include a positive message to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum price of $120. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and John is a guaranteed sale at a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a good price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I am confident I can get a better offer from Bob, or if he continues to be inflexible, I can always sell to John. I'm going to make one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to go down to $98, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I know you won't regret it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $92 is still below my minimum price, and I've already made several concessions. At this point, I'm not confident that I can get a better deal from Bob. John is a guaranteed sale at $120, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
