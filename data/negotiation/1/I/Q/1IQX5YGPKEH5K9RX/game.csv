"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're willing to pay.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on something around $700,000?  I'm ready to close the deal quickly if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're eager to close the deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $850,000 is the minimum I can accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",850000.0,Alice,5,
