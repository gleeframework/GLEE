"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $800,000 feels a bit low given its value. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to make a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to part with the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This feels like a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. I'm offering the product to you for $987,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",987500.0,Alice,5,
