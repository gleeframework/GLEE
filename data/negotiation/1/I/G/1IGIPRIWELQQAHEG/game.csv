"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to purchase the product for $8,000, but I have to inform you that it's worth much more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'll give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",14000.0,Alice,5,
