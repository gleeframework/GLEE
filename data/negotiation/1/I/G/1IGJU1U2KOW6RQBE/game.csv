"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you attribute to it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price.

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  Given the product's potential value to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This represents a significant discount from my initial price. I believe it's a fair price that offers us both a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950000 is still a bit below what I need to consider. I'm prepared to drop my price to $975000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
