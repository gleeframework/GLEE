,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's still a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. ",100.0,Alice,5,
