Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer to Bob:

**Strategy:**

The key is understanding your fallback position. You *know* John will buy the product for $1,500,000. This becomes your ""safety net"".  Therefore, any offer to Bob should aim for more than $1,500,000 to make the negotiation worthwhile.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Targeting Above Your Minimum:** The offered price of $1,600,000 is strategically placed above your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you have a strong fallback, starting too high might immediately deter Bob. This offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Confident Tone:** The message exudes confidence in the product's value, subtly justifying the price without directly revealing your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to give yourself more bargaining room. 
* **Relationship Value:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower offer, fostering goodwill while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit with the understanding that a bird in the hand (John's offer) is worth a lot!"
