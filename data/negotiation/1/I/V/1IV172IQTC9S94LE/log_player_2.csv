"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is under your $10,000 limit, you know you have a backup option with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down closer to her product's value of $8,000.  You're in a good negotiating position!"
