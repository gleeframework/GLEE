"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a profit.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $12,375? I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12375.0,Bob,4,
