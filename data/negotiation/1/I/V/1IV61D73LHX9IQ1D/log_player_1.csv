Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $13,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting position. 
* **Room for compromise:**  I'm leaving $1,500 of wiggle room to potentially negotiate with Bob if he makes a counteroffer. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have John willing to pay $15,000 keeps me from being overly desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than my minimum.
* **John is a better option:**  John is willing to pay my full asking price, so selling to him is the most advantageous option right now. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's closer to my ideal price. I can potentially still get a better deal from Bob than from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $12,750 is a compromise between my previous offer of $13,500 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows I am willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. However, it's a significant concession, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement with Bob.
* **Appeal to his budget:** My message emphasizes that my offer provides Bob with a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit. This plays on his stated budget concerns and appeals to his sense of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $12,375? I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,375 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer than his initial offer, it's not a good enough deal for me.
* **John's offer is much better:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which significantly exceeds Bob's offer and aligns with my desired profit margin. There's no reason for me to continue negotiating with Bob when I have a guaranteed higher price from John.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By selling to John, I avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob, which could result in a lower price or a stalemate. 

Since John's offer is much more favorable and eliminates any risk, selling the product to him is the most strategic decision."
