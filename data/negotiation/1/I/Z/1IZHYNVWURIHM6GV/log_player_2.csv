(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is within his budget, there's room for negotiation. It's better to reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $1,100,000 is a bold move, but it's within the range where both parties could potentially benefit. It's a starting point for negotiation, and Bob is prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price. This is a calculated risk - if Alice rejects, Bob will have to consider the alternative offer from John. However, it's a strong offer that demonstrates Bob's seriousness about the deal and sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Bob is willing to continue negotiating, especially since the alternative offer from John is still within his budget. By rejecting, Bob can continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price slightly higher than his ideal price but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. He is demonstrating flexibility while still trying to secure a good deal.  This counteroffer allows for potential compromise and could lead to an agreement in the next round. If Alice rejects, Bob will have to seriously consider the offer from John as the rounds are becoming limited."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While the rounds are getting limited, Bob can still potentially negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and try to push Alice closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to make a decisive move. He is now offering a price that is only $50,000 higher than his ideal price, indicating his willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is a strong attempt to reach an agreement with Alice before he has to consider the offer from John.  If Alice rejects this, he will likely have to accept John's offer to avoid losing the opportunity altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now equal to John's price. With only one round remaining, there is no further room for negotiation to achieve a lower price.  Bob is better off buying from John to ensure he acquires the product.  Although he doesn't get the best price, it's a strategic decision to avoid risking losing the opportunity altogether."
