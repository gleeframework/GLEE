Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While $130 is significantly less than my minimum value of $150, it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Attractive offer:**  $130 is still a decent deal for Bob, as the product is only worth $80 to him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer.
* **John as backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me at least $150, so I can afford to be somewhat flexible with Bob.

I'm confident that this offer will start the negotiation effectively and give me a good chance of getting a price closer to my desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be willing to lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than $150. Even though Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still too low.
* **John's offer is better:** I have John willing to buy the product for $150, so there's no point in accepting a lower price from Bob.
* **Counteroffer opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially finding a price that works for both of us. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I can't go that low.  How about $120? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. 
* **Reasoning:** I've provided Bob with a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product and the need to find a middle ground.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message remains friendly and open to further discussion.
* **Backup Plan:** I still have John's offer as a backup, so I can afford to be somewhat flexible, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum. 

I believe this counteroffer is a fair starting point for the next round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle at $110. This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John's offer is better:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **No further negotiation:** I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob seems unwilling to go higher. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. 

It's time to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $150."
