"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. This item holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth may be different for you. Given its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. I am offering this product to you for $120. I hope you find this price fair and look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to buy it at your desired price point."
