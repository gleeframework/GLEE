Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's also a good starting point given my minimum value of $120. I'm hoping to get as close to $150 as possible, but I'm also prepared to accept a lower price if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum value of $120. It's also likely that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and I risk losing the sale to John.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most financially sound decision at this point."
