Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let it go for $170. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential bargaining or a counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $150, Alice subtly anchors Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  While not explicitly stated, the message implies that Bob has the first opportunity to purchase. This can encourage a quicker decision. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net (John) willing to pay $150, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough for Bob to accept."
