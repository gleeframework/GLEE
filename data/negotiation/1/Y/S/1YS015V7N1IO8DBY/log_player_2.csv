"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $11,500, which is a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is closer to your maximum budget than John's price of $12,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. There's a chance Alice might come back with a better offer closer to her own valuation of $10,000. 
* You still have the safety net of buying from John for $12,000 if negotiations with Alice fall through."
