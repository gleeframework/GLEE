Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum but still attractive to Bob. He gains $10 in value ($150 - $140), making it likely he'll accept."
