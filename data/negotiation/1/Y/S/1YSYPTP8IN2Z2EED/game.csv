"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of value.  I'm asking for $15,000 to start. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $9,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $13,500.  This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,250. Can we meet in the middle again?",11250.0,Bob,4,
