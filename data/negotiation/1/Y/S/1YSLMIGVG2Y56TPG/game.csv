,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a very competitive price considering its potential return on investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. While $950,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I need to be mindful of the product's true worth. I'm willing to consider $1,000,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant concession on my part and I believe it's more than fair.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a significant concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,6,
