"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This will give me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, but I'm also leaving myself an escape route if he isn't interested at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more to Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still leaving a good margin for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm still hoping to close a deal with Bob.  I'll see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm starting to run out of time. While I would love to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on any deal at all.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and I'm going to take it."
