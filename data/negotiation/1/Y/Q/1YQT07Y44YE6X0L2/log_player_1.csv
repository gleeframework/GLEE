"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum. I'm hoping he'll counteroffer, and we can negotiate from there.  If he rejects, I'll consider my options in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $12,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll make another counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to get closer to my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting close, but I'm not convinced I can get to my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
