"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly above $11,000.  I could go as low as $15,000, but that's my absolute limit.",15000.0,Alice,5,
