"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. However, I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'd like to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value I'm placing on it and is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. Considering your offer of $950,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
