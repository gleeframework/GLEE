"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. This is still a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9000?  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $9200. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $9200 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $8800? This would allow me to move forward with the purchase and would still be a good deal for you, given your initial asking price.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before we run out of time.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,7,
