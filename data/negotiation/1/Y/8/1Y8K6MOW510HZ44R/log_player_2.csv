Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,000, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer.  Buying from John guarantees the best price for Bob."
