"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth a lot to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps to build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing the potential for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is an improvement from his initial assessment, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is Key:** I want to see if I can push for a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a higher price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, I'm showing him that I'm serious about getting a fair price and am not desperate to sell at his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasizing the Deal:** I remind Bob about the value of the product and how this price is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** I continue to use a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship and keep the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I don't want to miss out on potentially getting a price closer to $1,000,000 or higher from Bob.  I'm still confident in my negotiation skills and ability to secure a good deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continued Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's in between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Fairness Emphasized:**  I'm highlighting that this offer is ""fair"" and a ""great deal"" for both of us. This helps to frame the price as mutually beneficial.
* **Urgency and Motivation:** I suggest that we ""close this deal and move forward,"" creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept."
