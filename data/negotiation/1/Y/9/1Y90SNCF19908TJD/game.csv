"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be open to that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you've already acknowledged the product has to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
