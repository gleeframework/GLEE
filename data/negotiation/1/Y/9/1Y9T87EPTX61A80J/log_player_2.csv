"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to the product's worth to Alice ($10,000), it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is just too low for me.  How about $9000? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, it's in Bob's best interest to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
