"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $6,000 is significantly below my bottom line. Could you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to a feasible price point, I'm still aiming for something more affordable. Would you be open to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $9,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is tempting, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $8,000.  Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,6,
