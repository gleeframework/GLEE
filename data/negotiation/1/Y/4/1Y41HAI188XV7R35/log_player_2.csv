"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:** $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,100,000 and is considerably lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, Alice might be unwilling to go lower, and Bob risks ending up buying from John at a higher price.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Alice's offer is a good compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his counteroffer of $950,000.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a favorable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher cost."
