"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? That's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

 Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you, and this price allows for a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $13500. How about we split the difference and go with $12750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price. It's better to take this deal than to risk getting nothing or having to sell to John for the minimum price."
