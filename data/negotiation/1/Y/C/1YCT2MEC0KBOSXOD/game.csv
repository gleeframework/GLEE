"Alice,  $9500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  I'm confident this product is worth it to me at that price, and I'm ready to make a deal today.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $8000 is a serious one, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8750. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $250. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
