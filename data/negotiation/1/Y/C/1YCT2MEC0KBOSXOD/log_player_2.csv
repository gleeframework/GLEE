"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $9,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  I'm confident this product is worth it to me at that price, and I'm ready to make a deal today."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $8000 is a serious one, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8750. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is closer to Bob's desired price point of $8,000.  While a further negotiation could potentially result in a lower price, accepting the offer still saves Bob $6,250 compared to buying from John.  There is a risk that further negotiation will fail, leaving Bob with no product or forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  The $750 difference is a reasonable compromise to secure the product."
