"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and even lower than the product's actual worth to you. Accepting her offer allows you to save $300,000.  While John offers the product at its worth to you, Alice's offer is a much better deal."
