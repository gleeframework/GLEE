"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $14,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high at $16,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $15,500. How about we try $15,750? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  $15,750 is still a bit high.  Let's try $15,250 and see if we can find a middle ground.",15250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,250 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $15,500 again, but this time I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth $250. This way, you'll get an even better deal than before. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the bonus feature, but $15,500 is still too high.  I'm willing to pay $15,250, but I'm not going to go any higher.  Let me know if you're willing to take that.",15250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to pay $15,250, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,250 and $15,000. How about we try $15,125? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15125.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really close to my limit.  Let's try $15,050.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's deal.",15050.0,Bob,10,
