"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This is a common tactic to start negotiations. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a higher price in the next round.  I'm also starting to get concerned that I might not be able to reach a deal with Bob, so I'm keeping the option of selling to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $130. This is another concession, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've made concessions and tried to negotiate, but it seems unlikely we'll reach a deal. To ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John."
