"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Given its value to me, I would like to propose a price of $120 for you to consider. This way, you can enjoy the benefits of the product at a reasonable price while also allowing me to recover a significant portion of its value. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While Alice's offer of $120 is less than her stated value, it's significantly more than your maximum budget of $80. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $80, which fits perfectly within your budget.

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to proceed with purchasing the product from John at a much better price."
