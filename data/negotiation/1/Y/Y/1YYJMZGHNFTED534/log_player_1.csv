Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my own. This gives Bob room to negotiate while also ensuring I maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that is higher than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  It's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and continuing to negotiate with Bob might risk him backing out altogether.  It's better to secure a sale at $13,000 than to potentially end up with nothing."
