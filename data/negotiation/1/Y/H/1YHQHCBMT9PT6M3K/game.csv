"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product looks great, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for sticking with me. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $9,750.  How about we make this the final offer - $10,500 and we have a deal?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you've got to meet me a bit more on this. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,6,
