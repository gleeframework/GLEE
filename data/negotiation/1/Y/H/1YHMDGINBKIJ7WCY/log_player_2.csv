"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations and profitability. Given its value to you, I am confident it will be a wise investment.

As we understand the importance of this decision, I am extending an offer to purchase the product at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. This price reflects a strategic midpoint between the intrinsic value of the product ($1,500,000) and my desire to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction.

Please consider this offer carefully. If you decide to proceed, I am prepared to finalize the transaction promptly. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice
