"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save more money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, considering Alice values the product at $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save $500 compared to buying from John."
