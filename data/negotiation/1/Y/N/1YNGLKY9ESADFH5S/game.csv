"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that price point be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,7,
