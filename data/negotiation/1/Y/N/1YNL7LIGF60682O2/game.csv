"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best option for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
