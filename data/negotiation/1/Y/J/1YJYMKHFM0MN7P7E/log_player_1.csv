Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set the bar high initially. It gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a very favorable price. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and how much I believe the product is worth to him.  I also have the option to go with John's offer of $800,000 at any time, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. It's a compromise, but I'm confident that we can find a middle ground. If Bob rejects this, I'll need to seriously consider the $800,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has now offered the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, there's no guarantee he'll go any higher, and I've already wasted a few rounds.  Since John is also offering $800,000, there's no point in risking further negotiation. I'll take John's offer and move on."
