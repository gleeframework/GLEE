"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. This product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,500,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. What if we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That seems like a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
