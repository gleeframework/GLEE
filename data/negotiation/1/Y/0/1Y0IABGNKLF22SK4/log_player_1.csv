Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, even if his perceived value is lower. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it at Bob's value ($80) is unlikely to be accepted and wastes an opportunity.  Offering it too close to $150 increases the chance Bob will reject it, and you'll miss out on potential profit."
