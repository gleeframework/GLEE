{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to your business. My initial asking price is $2,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept his $1,200,000 offer, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1750000, so I'll offer $1475000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, $1,475,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I believe I can negotiate a higher price, especially with only a few rounds left. I'll counteroffer Bob again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,475,000 still falls short of what I need to accept. I'm willing to drop to $1,650,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1650000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1475000 and $1650000, so I'll offer $1562500. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,562,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,562,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer of $1,562,500 is tempting, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer or rejecting a deal altogether. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is above my minimum price."
