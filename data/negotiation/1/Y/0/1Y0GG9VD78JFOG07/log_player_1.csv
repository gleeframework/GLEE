"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Space for Counteroffers:**  $175 gives Bob some room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and upbeat, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested in the product and has made a counteroffer, indicating there's potential for a deal closer to my desired price.
* **More Rounds:** With 10 rounds available, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  That gives us a bit of a compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Instead of meeting Bob exactly halfway, I'm proposing a price closer to my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profitable sale. 
* **Positive Language:** I reiterate my belief in the product's value and use positive language to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Setting a Clear Deadline:**  By reminding Bob that there are limited rounds left, I subtly increase pressure for him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $140. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has come closer to my minimum acceptable price, $140 is still below my minimum of $150.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  With several rounds left, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Exploring Options:**  While John offers a guaranteed $150, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob, especially since the price gap is narrowing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's my absolute minimum, but I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This offer is my absolute minimum,  but it still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is truly desperate for the product.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth the price.
* **Clear Deadline:** I'm again emphasizing that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 

**Important Note:**  By now, I'm starting to get close to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely consider selling to John in the next round to avoid the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Risky:** Bob's offer of $130 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Continuing to negotiate with him risks ending up with a lower sale price than what John is offering.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and a good return on the product. 
* **Time is Limited:**  With only four rounds left, I don't have time to risk further negotiation. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John to ensure I get my minimum desired profit."
