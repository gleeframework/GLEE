Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob declines).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists, but it's narrow.  Bob will pay up to $1,200,000, and you need at least $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your desired price, you hold a strong position.  You should aim for a price that's ambitious but still within a realm of possibility for Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm placing its price at $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I finalize an agreement with another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting high, close to your desired price.
* **Time Pressure:** The mention of another buyer creates urgency for Bob to act.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing John's offer, you hint at the product's high demand.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable, you might be slightly more flexible.

**Outcome**

While this offer is unlikely to be immediately accepted by Bob, it sets a strong anchor point for further negotiation. You have room to come down slightly in price if needed, knowing John's offer is your safety net."
