Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $8,200. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll appreciate the value of the product. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of her increasing her price or the negotiation failing. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees the best price."
