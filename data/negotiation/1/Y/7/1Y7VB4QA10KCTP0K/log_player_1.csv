Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob only values the product at $80, Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer at $150. Therefore, she starts with a strong offer close to her minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing Alice to potentially earn even more than $140, while still staying well above her minimum.
* **Direct and clear:** The message is straightforward and clearly states Alice's offer, avoiding any confusion.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
