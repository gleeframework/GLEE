{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to your operations.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I understand this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This price still offers you a significant value proposition, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a good deal.  Let's meet halfway on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000,  $900,000 is a good deal and allows me to avoid selling to John for $800,000. It's a fair price that keeps the negotiation moving forward and ensures I get a substantial return."
