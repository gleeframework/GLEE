"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations. Given the value this product holds, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Signaling Value:** By starting at $2,000,000, I'm signaling that I believe the product is worth significantly more than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer, but I want to see if I can maximize my profit with Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for a successful partnership. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum and what John is offering.  Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, and I can try to steer him closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still aiming high to maintain room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to counter Bob's lower perception.  This reinforces the idea that my price is justified. 
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, the phrase ""to move this forward"" subtly implies there are other options available to me if we can't find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while also giving us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and also higher than what John is offering. 
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk of Bob walking away or stalling negotiations. Accepting now secures a profitable deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now also has a time value component.  Getting the money sooner is generally preferable to potentially waiting longer for a slightly higher amount."
