,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for a successful partnership.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while also giving us both a good deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
