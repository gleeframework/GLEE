"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations. Given the value this product holds, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for a successful partnership."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while also giving us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
