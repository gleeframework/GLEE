"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  $900,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and I believe it's a good middle ground. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $875,000 is a good compromise and significantly lower than what John is offering.  It's also above Alice's minimum acceptable price, indicating she is also willing to settle."
