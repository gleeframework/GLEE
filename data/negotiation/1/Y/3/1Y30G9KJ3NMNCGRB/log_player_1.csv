Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start higher with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or maximizes profit if Bob accepts the initial offer.
* **Slight markup:**  A price of $135 represents a 12.5% markup. It's a reasonable increase that might be appealing to Bob while still netting you a profit. 
* **Limited-time offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
