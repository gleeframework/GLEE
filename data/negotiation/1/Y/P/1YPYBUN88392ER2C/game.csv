"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $14000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still being reasonable for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12500. This price is higher than my initial proposal but still within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $13500. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope it works for you.",13500.0,Alice,7,
