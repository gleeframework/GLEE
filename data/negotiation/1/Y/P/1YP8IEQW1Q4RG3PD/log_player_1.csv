Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair starting point, and I'm confident I can get a good price from Bob.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is more than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll see if I can get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $90. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price. I'm willing to go down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm not going to settle for anything significantly less than $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $82.5 is only slightly less than what I could get from John. I'd rather close the deal now, as further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price."
