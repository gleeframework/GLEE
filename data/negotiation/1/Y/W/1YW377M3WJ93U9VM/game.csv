"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $900,000, which still reflects the product's unique value. Let's see if we can find a compromise that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,
