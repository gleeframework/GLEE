Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. This means Alice doesn't need to go below that price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiating style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
