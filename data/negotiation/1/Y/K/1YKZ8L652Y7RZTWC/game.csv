"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique product, $14000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
