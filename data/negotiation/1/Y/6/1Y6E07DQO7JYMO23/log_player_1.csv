Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed backup buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys at your minimum. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John, your backup buyer. This is your advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without scaring Bob away.  Since you have a guaranteed sale, you're in a strong position to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Use phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""confident"" to frame the offer positively.
* **High Target:** $1,150,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Value Focus:** Emphasize the ""unique value and potential"" to remind Bob of the product's worth to him.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get $150,000 more than your minimum, a great outcome.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate down slightly, but hold firm closer to $1,100,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000. You lose some potential profit, but you still meet your goal. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you only get one offer to Bob.  If you have multiple rounds of negotiation, you can adjust accordingly."
