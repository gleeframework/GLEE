Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value of $8,000, but still lower than my guaranteed sale price of $15,000 to John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while also ensuring that I maximize my profits if he accepts."
