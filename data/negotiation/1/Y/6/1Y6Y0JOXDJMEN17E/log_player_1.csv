Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for compromise. This allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher final price.
* **Justification:** While the initial price is high, mentioning the ""unique value"" sets the stage for a discussion about the product's specific benefits to Bob.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Indicating willingness to discuss further shows flexibility and encourages Bob to participate actively in the negotiation.

This strategy keeps the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement while acknowledging Bob's potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

While selling to John is a guaranteed option, it's worth exploring if you can reach a price closer to your desired range with Bob before settling for the immediate sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This price reflects the unique benefits it offers and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** Lowering the price by $250,000 demonstrates flexibility while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  Re-emphasizing the ""unique benefits"" reinforces the product's value beyond Bob's initial assessment. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Phrasing like ""middle ground"" and ""mutually beneficial"" emphasizes the collaborative nature of the negotiation.

This counteroffer attempts to bring Bob closer to your desired price range while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  Would you consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair offer, considering I'm willing to move significantly from my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer increased, but it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and your previous counteroffer. While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, his increments are too small to make a deal likely within a reasonable timeframe.  Continuing to negotiate at this pace might not be the most efficient use of your time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions remains substantial.  To be transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase the product at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would benefit you greatly.  Therefore, I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,400,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my sincere desire to reach a deal. Let me know your decision promptly."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and signal that further haggling is unlikely.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning John, without revealing his offer, subtly increases pressure on Bob without being overly aggressive.
* **Value & Concession:**  Reiterating the product's value to Bob while highlighting your significant price reduction emphasizes the attractiveness of this final offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  Requesting a prompt decision encourages Bob to act quickly rather than prolonging the negotiation.

This approach attempts to secure a favorable outcome for you while still leaving the door open for Bob to accept a mutually beneficial deal."
