(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120, so it's definitely not worth accepting. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about $95? That's closer to my budget, and hopefully, it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 95}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $98 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm comfortable buying the product from John for $80, so I'll go with that option."
