"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $150 to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

I'm going to try to get a better price from Alice.  $140 is a decent deal, but I want to see if I can save a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $135? That way we both come out a little ahead."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $137.50. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $137.50 is a good compromise.  It's a bit higher than I wanted to pay, but it's still a good deal compared to buying from John. I'm going to accept her offer."
