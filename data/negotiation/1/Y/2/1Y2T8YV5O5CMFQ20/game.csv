"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?  I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $5,000 is far too low. I understand you're on a budget, but  I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a touch high for me. How about we settle at $7,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
