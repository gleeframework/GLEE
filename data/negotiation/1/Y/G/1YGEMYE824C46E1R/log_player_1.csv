Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation (if Bob counter-offers).
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation.

**Why not ask for the full $1,200,000?**

While tempting, demanding the absolute maximum might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal. This could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. A slightly lower price increases the chance of a successful sale."
