"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I believe my initial price is closer to its true worth given its potential. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $950,000 is a little too low for me. How about we settle on $975,000? That's my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
