"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,050,000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000,  which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
