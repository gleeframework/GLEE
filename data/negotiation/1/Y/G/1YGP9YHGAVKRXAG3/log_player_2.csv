"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it highly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above your maximum budget. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
