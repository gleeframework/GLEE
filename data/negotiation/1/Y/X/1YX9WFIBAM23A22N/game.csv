"Alice, your offer is far too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800000.  This is my absolute top price. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $800000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800000.  This is the very best I can do.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to try to meet you in the middle again. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not ready to give up yet, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
