Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $800000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer.  It's not the best price, but it's within my budget and I don't want to risk losing the product altogether."
