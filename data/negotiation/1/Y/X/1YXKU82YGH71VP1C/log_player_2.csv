"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know this product is worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  There are 9 rounds left, and Bob has the upper hand knowing Alice's minimum selling price is $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire for a good deal. 
* **Strategic Move:** By offering $12,000, Bob is aiming to find a middle ground that both parties can agree on. 
* **Negotiation Mindset:** Bob is setting the stage for further negotiation, showcasing his willingness to compromise while still aiming to maximize his savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob has the advantage of knowing Alice is willing to go lower. 
* **Seeking a better deal:**  Bob's goal is to pay as little as possible, and there's still a chance to get a price closer to his target of $12,000. 
* **No rush:** With several rounds remaining, Bob can afford to continue negotiating without the immediate pressure of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $12,500? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** Bob is raising his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** By offering $12,500, Bob is aiming for a price point that is reasonably close to his target while still offering a decent margin for Alice.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while giving Bob a chance to secure a price closer to his desired range."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $12,800? This is a price I'm comfortable with, and it's only a bit higher than your offer.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
