"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $12,500? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $12,800? This is a price I'm comfortable with, and it's only a bit higher than your offer.  Let's make this deal happen!",12800.0,Alice,5,
