"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,000?  That would be a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting a little frustrated with this negotiation.  $10,700 just isn't enough for me to make this worth my while.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to sell to John.",10750.0,Alice,7,
