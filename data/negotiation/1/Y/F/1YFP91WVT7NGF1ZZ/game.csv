"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500. How about we settle on $8,750? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth it.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway in your last offer. However, $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to split the difference again. How about we settle on $8,625? This price is closer to what I can afford, and I think it would be a fair compromise.",8625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,625. How about we meet you halfway between $8,750 and $8,625? That would put the price at $8,687.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth it.",8687.5,Alice,5,
