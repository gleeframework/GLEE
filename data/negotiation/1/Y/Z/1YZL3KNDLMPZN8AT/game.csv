"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $115 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $120?  That's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you consider $118?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference for me. ",118.0,Bob,4,
