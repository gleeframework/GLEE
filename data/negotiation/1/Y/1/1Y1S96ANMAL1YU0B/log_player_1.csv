Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Simply stating a high price isn't enough. By mentioning ""value"" and ""benefits,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob's initial assessment. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a psychological element. It suggests scarcity and might make Bob more eager to secure the deal.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** Alice gets a fantastic deal, earning $400,000 above her minimum.
* **Bob negotiates:**  This is the most likely scenario. Alice has room to lower the price while still staying above her $800,000 minimum.
* **Bob rejects outright:**  Alice can return with a counter-offer closer to Bob's perceived value, knowing she has John as a backup. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Alice could choose a less aggressive opening price, especially if she wants to foster a good relationship with Bob for potential future deals."
