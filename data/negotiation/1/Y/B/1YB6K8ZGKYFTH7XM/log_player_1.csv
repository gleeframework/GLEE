Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point as it is close to Bob's perceived value of the product, but leaves some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can see how much he is willing to pay and adjust our counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the $14,000 offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We're going to try to meet Bob halfway.  $13,500 is a good compromise between our initial offer and Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to our desired price, and we're only $200 away from our previous offer.  It's unlikely we'll get much more, and it's a better deal than selling to John."
