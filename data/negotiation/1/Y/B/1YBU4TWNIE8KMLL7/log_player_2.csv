"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,200,000. This indicates she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob more leverage to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his limit as possible.  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It shows Bob is serious about buying but is also firm on his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still too high for Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating for a better deal, with the knowledge that he can always buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise. $900,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but getting closer to a possible agreement.  It's a calculated risk, testing Alice's desire to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's limit.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.  Bob can counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap with Alice, and potentially reach a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob is pushing the negotiation closer to his target. A counteroffer of $950,000 shows continued progress and might convince Alice to accept, especially since she's already significantly lowered her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's price, he still has room to negotiate. It's worth pushing for a better price, especially since he has the option of buying from John.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

Bob is strategically increasing his offer again.  $975,000 is a significant move towards Alice's last offer and leaves little room for further negotiation. It shows Bob is serious about acquiring the product and puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing a deal close to her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though Alice has come down to $1,000,000, Bob still has one round left to try and get a better price. There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer close to her current offer, especially since she's already lowered her price significantly.  Furthermore, the price from John is a safety net, allowing Bob to take a calculated risk in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 985000}
```

This is Bob's final offer. It's a slight increase from his previous offer, showing willingness to compromise, but still significantly lower than Alice's price. This is a calculated risk.  Alice might accept, knowing that Bob has a backup option. If she rejects, Bob can move on to John."
