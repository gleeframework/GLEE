"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is already a discount from its true value to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also acknowledging your need to make a profit. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while also being reasonable for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,150,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would allow me to make the purchase while ensuring you still get a fair return on your investment.  ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to throw in some additional support and resources that will enhance the product's value to you. In exchange, I'd like to get $1,120,000. This way, you'll get an even better deal, and I'll still come out ahead.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
