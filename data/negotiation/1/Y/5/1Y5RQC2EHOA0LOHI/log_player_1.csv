Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, giving me a good profit.
* It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000), making it a potentially attractive offer for him.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by offering a price that is both profitable for me and potentially acceptable to Bob. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price and avoid losing money."
