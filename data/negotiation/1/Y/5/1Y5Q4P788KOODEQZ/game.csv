"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to the value you see in the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? That's the highest I can go.",9750.0,Bob,4,
