"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a special price.  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate and get a price much higher than her product's worth to her ($800,000).
* While her offer is below your maximum ($1,000,000), you have a better alternative with John.
* Rejecting her offer opens up the possibility of a lower counter-offer from Alice, or you can proceed to buy from John for a guaranteed lower price."
