"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we work something closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
