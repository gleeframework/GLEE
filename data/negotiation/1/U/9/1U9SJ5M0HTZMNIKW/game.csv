"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $19000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can sell it to you for $18500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $18500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17500 and $18500, so I'm offering $18000. Can you consider that price?",18000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $18500, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I can sell it to you for $18800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18800.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $18500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",18500.0,Bob,8,

"I can see you're really committed to getting this deal done, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can sell it to you for $19000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",19000.0,Alice,9,
