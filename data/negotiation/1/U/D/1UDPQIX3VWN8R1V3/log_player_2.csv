# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, claiming it holds ""$15,000 in benefits"" to me when I've already established my upper limit is $15,000. While $12,000 is less than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, I signal that I'm looking for a price closer to its actual value to her ($8,000)."
