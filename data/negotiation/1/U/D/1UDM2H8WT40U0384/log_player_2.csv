"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  I'm confident this product is worth the investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He's already shown he's willing to pay $8,500, and John is offering it for $8,000.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to each other's price points."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see you're really interested in this product! Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's a price I can live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has come down in price, but she's still asking more than Bob is willing to pay. At this point, he's already spent 4 rounds negotiating and has only 6 rounds left. It's unlikely he'll be able to convince Alice to drop to $8,000 or lower. Buying from John guarantees the best price and gets him the product without further negotiation."
