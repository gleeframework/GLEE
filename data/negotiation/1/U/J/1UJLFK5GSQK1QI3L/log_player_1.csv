"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While I want to maximize profit, starting at $1,500,000 (Bob's valuation) could seem too aggressive and discourage him. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him. 
* **Open to Discussion:** My tone is collaborative (""What are your thoughts?"") to encourage an open dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum, and I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  While selling to John is an option, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting now keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential this product holds."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm lowering my price by a significant amount ($50,000) to signal I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  I'm aiming high, but my offer is still $150,000 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential gains to incentivize him to accept a higher price. 
* **Confident Tone:**  I'm using a firm but fair tone to maintain control of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for more, Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure a good deal now."
