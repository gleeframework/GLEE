,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $87 for you, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $87 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $86.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can finalize the purchase right away.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $88. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Let me know if that works for you!",88.0,Alice,5,
