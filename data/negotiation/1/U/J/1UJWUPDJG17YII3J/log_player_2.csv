You can do better than $90, so you should reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $87 for you, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!

You're still closer to your goal of getting the product for under $80. Keep trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $87 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $86.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can finalize the purchase right away."", ""product_price"": 86}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $88. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is offering $88, which is closer to your goal of $80 than John's offer of $100. It's time to accept the offer and move on. You've saved $12 compared to buying from John!"
