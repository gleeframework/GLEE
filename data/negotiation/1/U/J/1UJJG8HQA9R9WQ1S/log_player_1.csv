{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates a lower price.

By positioning the offer this way, Alice increases her chances of a successful sale at a price that benefits both parties."
