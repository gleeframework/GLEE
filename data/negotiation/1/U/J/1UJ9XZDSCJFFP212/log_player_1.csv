Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could net a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
    * Still attractive enough compared to the guaranteed sale price, incentivizing me to secure the deal with Bob if possible. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The message hints at other potential buyers (""limited-time offer"", ""other interested parties""). This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer."
