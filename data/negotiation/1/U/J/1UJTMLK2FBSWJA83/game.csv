"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to get a better price, and I believe $1,200,000 is a more reasonable starting point for our negotiation. This still gives you a significant profit, and allows me to invest in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, but my initial offer already reflected a significant discount on the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,250,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you still make a good profit.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
