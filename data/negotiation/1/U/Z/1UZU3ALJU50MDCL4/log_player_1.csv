Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me a chance to see if Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'll counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident in the value of my product. $11,000 is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
