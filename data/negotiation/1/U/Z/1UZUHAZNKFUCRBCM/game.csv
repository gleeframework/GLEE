"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's true value. How about $1,050,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant advantage. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,000,000. This will give us both a good deal and we can finally close this transaction. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
