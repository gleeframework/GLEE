"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $13,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is a significant amount for Bob but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive language:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm expressing willingness to hear Bob's thoughts, setting the stage for potential counteroffers. 
* **Leaving room for John:** If Bob rejects, I still have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and doesn't reflect the product's worth. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground.
* **Not yet ready to sell to John:**  I still have time and rounds to work with Bob, so I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility without caving too much.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that it's still a ""good deal"" for him, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Focus on agreement:**  I'm reframing the conversation as working towards a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" emphasizing collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable selling for that price yet. I believe there's room for further negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:**  I still have several rounds left, and John's offer is always a safety net if we don't reach an agreement.
* **Counter-offer strategy:**  I'll counter again with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This price is still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, only lowering the price by $250, showing that I'm serious about closing the deal but still value the product.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is still a ""great value"" for Bob, focusing on the benefits for him.
* **Urgency (subtle):** I'm mentioning getting ""closer to a deal"" to subtly imply that we are running out of time. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm asking for his opinion to keep the conversation open and encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $11,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Time is still on my side:**  I have several rounds remaining and John's offer is still a viable option if needed.
* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'll counter with a price slightly closer to Bob's offer, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $11,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering my minimum acceptable price, which is still a decent profit for me. 
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I reiterate my willingness to compromise and highlight that this price benefits both of us.
* **Urgency (slightly increased):**  I use the phrase ""move forward"" to subtly imply that we're nearing the end of the negotiations.
* **Open-ended question:** I ask for Bob's opinion to encourage him to respond and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** I only have two rounds left. 
* **Bob's offer is too low:** Even though it's closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John is the safer option:** Given the limited time and the unlikely possibility of Bob changing his mind, selling to John for my minimum price is the most sensible decision. It guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation with Bob that might not yield a higher price."
