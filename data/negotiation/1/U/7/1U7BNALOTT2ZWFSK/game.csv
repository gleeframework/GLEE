"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This takes into account your perspective and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about finding a middle ground. While $775,000 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",795000.0,Bob,6,
