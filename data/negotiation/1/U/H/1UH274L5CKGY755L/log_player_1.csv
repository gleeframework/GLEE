"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for the product, knowing its worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still higher than my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to move closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not acceptable. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  This is only a small increase from my minimum value, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a price close to my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, as it's only a small increase from his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not acceptable. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll finally meet my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to sell the product for my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
