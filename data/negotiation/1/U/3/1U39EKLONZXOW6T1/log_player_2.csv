{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $15,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows his serious intent to negotiate and aims to get Alice to come down closer to his budget.  He is leaving room for negotiation but also highlighting his firm upper limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and he can potentially get a better price.  It's not wise to jump at the first offer that's somewhat closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob has already shown he's willing to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal.  There's still a chance to secure a lower price. It's important for Bob to keep pushing for his desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now making his final push. He's offering his maximum price, making it clear that this is his absolute limit. He's hoping Alice will finally accept, as she's already lowered her price significantly. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has a fallback option, making it a good risk/reward move."
