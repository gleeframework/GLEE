"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale quickly.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $880,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This price would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $880,000 is closer to our target, we're still a bit apart. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us to finalize the sale quickly.  Let me know if you're ready to make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $870,000 for the product. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. If this price isn't acceptable, I may need to explore other options.",870000.0,Bob,6,
