Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  I can lower the price if Bob counteroffers.
* **It shows value:**  The high price demonstrates that I believe the product is valuable. 

I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and gauge his interest further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 

By lowering my price slightly, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial value assessment. This counteroffer should give Bob an incentive to come closer to my desired price while still being a reasonable amount for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and I'm getting closer to my desired price point.  At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,250,000.  While I would ideally like to get more, it's important to balance getting the best price with the risk of losing the deal altogether."
