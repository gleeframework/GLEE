Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This will hopefully encourage Bob to negotiate, giving me the chance to earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is more than John's offer, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation but also seeking a higher price. This compromise might encourage Bob to accept the offer, while still earning me more than John's offer."
