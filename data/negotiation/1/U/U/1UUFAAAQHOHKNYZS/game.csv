"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500, as I believe this is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's try to find a middle ground here!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm willing to pay $11,000. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
