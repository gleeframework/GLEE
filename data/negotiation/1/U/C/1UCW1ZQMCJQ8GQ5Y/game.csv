"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's my final offer. It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",850000.0,Alice,5,
