"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is significantly higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the product's value to me to emphasize the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Openness:** I'm keeping the communication open and inviting Bob to respond. 
* **Strategic Reserve:**  If Bob rejects, I still have room to lower the price in subsequent rounds while staying above John's offer, ensuring I get at least $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $10,000 is higher than Bob's initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Potential Upside:** I believe there is room to negotiate further with Bob, possibly reaching a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, but I have 8 more rounds to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a substantial discount considering what it's worth to me. Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $11,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to me, but also acknowledging Bob's desire for a deal. 
* **Middle Ground:**  The counter-offer represents a middle ground, showing flexibility while maintaining a price point above my minimum threshold. 
* **Strategic Consideration:** This counter-offer allows me to test Bob's willingness to negotiate further while staying within a safe range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $11,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is only $500 less than my previous offer of $11,500. This indicates a strong possibility of reaching a deal.
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 4, and while I can keep negotiating, the risk of losing a deal with John is increasing. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price above John's offer, but it's only $4,000 less than my desired price.  
* **Strategic Move:** This acceptance demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob I am serious about closing the deal. 

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial goal, accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures a profit."
