"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I still have time to negotiate with Bob and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to make this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob for another round or two.  If I don't see any progress, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,250.  I think this is a fair price considering your value for the product and my need to get a decent return. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $11250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $11,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $12,000, we've reached a stalemate in our negotiations.  Selling to Bob at $11,000 is a good deal, and  I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by pushing for more."
