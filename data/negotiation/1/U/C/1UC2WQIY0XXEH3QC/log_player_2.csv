"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less than $9,000, and you should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,500. It's a great price, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. It's a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for $8,500, which is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000 and still saves you $500 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Alice will budge, and you risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
