Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,600,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique item,"" you aim to create a sense of value that might justify the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price he might find reasonable considering the product's worth to him."
