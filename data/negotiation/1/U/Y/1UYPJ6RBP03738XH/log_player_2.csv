"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is far too high. You know you have a fallback option at $1,000,000 so there's no need to even consider this initial offer.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer (in this case, almost half of Alice's initial price) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a lower number first, you're trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired price point. Even if Alice rejects this outright, it sets the stage for future counteroffers to be lower than her initial $1,600,000.
* **Alternative:** It's important to remember you have John as a backup option. While you want to negotiate with Alice, don't be afraid to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than I had in mind, I understand there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer takes into account the true value and potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit, but $1,400,000 is still too high. It seems like she's willing to negotiate, so continuing the back-and-forth is the right move. There's a good chance you can get her price down further without having to resort to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's a fair offer considering its value to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to signal a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a significant price reduction. It's a bit more aggressive than simply splitting the difference between her last offer and your previous counteroffer, but it keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Justifying the Price:**  By mentioning that the price is fair for ""both of us,"" you subtly remind Alice that you're aiming for a mutually beneficial deal, not just trying to lowball her. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:**  You're still a comfortable distance away from your $1,000,000 fallback with John. This keeps the pressure on Alice to make a more substantial move if she wants to close the deal."
