"Hi Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price considering your stated value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $9,750 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a good way to reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,
