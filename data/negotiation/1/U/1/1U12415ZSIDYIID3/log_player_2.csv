"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but also wants to stay within a reasonable range.  Offering $105 is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's a fair compromise between Alice's initial offer and Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I have to make a living too. I can do $108, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is very close to Bob's desired price point of $105.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $2 compared to buying from John. While there's always the chance of negotiating further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few more dollars."
