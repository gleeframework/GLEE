"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1400000, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1600000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,
