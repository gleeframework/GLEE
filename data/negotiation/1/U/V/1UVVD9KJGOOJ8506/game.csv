"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. Considering the value I have in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I've already met you at $14500, and you're still at $14000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $14250. This is my last concession, and I expect you to meet me at this price.",14250.0,Alice,7,
