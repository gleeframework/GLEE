"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $9,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $9,500 is closer to my target, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal with some more negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
