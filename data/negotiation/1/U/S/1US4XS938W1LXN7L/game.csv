"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make a deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we start the conversation at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a big leap from where I'm at.  To be frank, I'm considering purchasing a similar product elsewhere for significantly less.  If you're able to come down to $650,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer, which would be $775,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can make a deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
