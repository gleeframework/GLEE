"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we start the conversation at $500,000?"", 
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $500,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It signals that I'm serious about buying but need a substantial price reduction. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer leaves plenty of room for negotiation. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I want to see how much Alice is willing to move first.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup option at $800,000 gives me leverage. If Alice is unwilling to negotiate reasonably, I can always walk away and purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a big leap from where I'm at.  To be frank, I'm considering purchasing a similar product elsewhere for significantly less.  If you're able to come down to $650,000, I'm ready to close the deal today."", 
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Urgency:** By mentioning an alternative product at a lower price, I'm introducing a sense of urgency without revealing my exact backup price (John's offer).
* **Significant but Believable Jump:** Moving from $500,000 to $650,000 is a substantial increase on my part, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Targeting a Favorable Outcome:**  This counteroffer aims to land somewhere between my initial offer and Alice's current price, ideally closer to my target range while leaving room for a final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer, which would be $775,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $775,000 is within a reasonable range of my $800,000 maximum and a significant saving from Alice's initial offers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Further negotiation carries the risk of Alice hardening her position or me overplaying my hand. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting a reasonable offer now allows me to move on."
