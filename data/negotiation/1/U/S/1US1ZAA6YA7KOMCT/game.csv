"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While it is a nice product, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Could we agree on $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
