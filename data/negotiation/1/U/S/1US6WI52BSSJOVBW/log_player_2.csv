{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $9,000 is a good price, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower. There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate, and I can always buy from John if the deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a better price than $9,000. I'm leaving room for negotiation but also showing Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal."

{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my target. It's a good middle ground that might persuade Alice to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $8,250 is a good price, it's still a bit higher than my target. I believe I can get closer to $7,500 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7750}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $8,125 is within my budget, and we're only two rounds away from the deadline.  While I'd still prefer to get closer to my target, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the opportunity and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
