Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is above my minimum threshold of $120, and I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential willingness to pay that amount. If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is offering my minimum price, and it's clear I won't get more from him. It's better to sell to Bob now and avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower offer in a counteroffer game."
