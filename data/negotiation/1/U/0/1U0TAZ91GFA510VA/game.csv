"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still above my comfort zone. Let's try $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
