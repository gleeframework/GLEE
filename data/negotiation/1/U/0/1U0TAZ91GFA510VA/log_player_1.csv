# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
