"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Therefore, accepting the offer is not an option. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is also not the best option at this point, as there's still room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and explore if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for Bob's ideal budget. While it's better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can likely push for a lower price in the next round.  Buying from John is still a last resort, as it's more expensive than Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still above my comfort zone. Let's try $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
