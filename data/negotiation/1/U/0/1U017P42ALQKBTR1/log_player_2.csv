# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,250,000 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's significantly lower than your alternative of buying from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you $250,000, which aligns with your goal of maximizing savings."
