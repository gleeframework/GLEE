Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with an offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) allows for negotiation while still leaving room for a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Strong Opening:** A strong opening offer can anchor the negotiation in your favor.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an unreasonably low price from Bob."
