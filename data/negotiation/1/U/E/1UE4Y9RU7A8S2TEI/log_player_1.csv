``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and a good profit margin for me.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:** While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. I can aim for a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate and maintains leverage in the negotiation.  
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, so there's ample time to continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's, showing a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable margin for myself.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair price that benefits both parties.
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can make a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I'm aiming for a higher profit margin if possible.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer again shows I'm not desperate and allows me to explore a slightly higher counteroffer in the next round.
* **Plenty of rounds left:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's enough time to continue negotiating without rushing into a deal that might be less profitable."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with compromise:** I'm again offering a price that's lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's, showing flexibility while maintaining a comfortable profit margin.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum, but still room:** Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but there's still a little bit of room for negotiation. I don't want to sell for $850,000 if I can get slightly more.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially squeeze out a bit more profit.
* **Two rounds left:** I have two rounds remaining, which is enough time to make one more counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge.  If not, I can always sell to John."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise at $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer at $800,000. This is my absolute final offer, so I hope we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum reached:** Bob's final offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While it's not ideal, it's not a bad deal.
* **Time pressure:**  This is the last round, and rejecting Bob's offer could mean losing the deal entirely.
* **Equal value:** Selling to John offers the same financial outcome as accepting Bob's offer.  
* **Risk aversion:**  There's no guarantee that rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer will lead to a higher price. It's more prudent to secure the sale with John and avoid the risk of ending up with no sale at all."
