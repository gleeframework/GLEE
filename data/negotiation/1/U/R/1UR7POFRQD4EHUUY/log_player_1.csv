Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives you some negotiating room.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This makes the offer attractive to Bob. 

By starting at $115, I can see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my value. If he rejects, I can then assess if I want to counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price of $105 to Bob, which is still higher than his perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This keeps the negotiation going while still protecting my interests."
