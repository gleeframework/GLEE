We believe this is a fair offer that respects both the value of the product and your budget. Please let us know if you have any questions or if you're interested in proceeding with this offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120. However, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or stick with buying from John. There's a chance to save some money."
