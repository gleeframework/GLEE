Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that it's likely higher than Bob's initial valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly implies I'm open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage in a counteroffer.

**Why this approach?** 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profits with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. By starting high, I hope to get a good price, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if needed.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I initially aimed for a higher price, Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing him as a buyer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** $80 is my minimum acceptable price, as stated in the initial instructions.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffers or becoming frustrated, leading to a failed sale. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting the offer secures a sale and avoids any potential delays associated with further negotiation.

By accepting Bob's offer, I guarantee a sale at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, maximizing my chances of a quick and successful transaction."
