Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was hoping to get a better deal. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the benefits I'll gain from the product.

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $880,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
