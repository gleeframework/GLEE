"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the value it can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I recognize its value, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a price that works for you.  $950,000 is still a bit below what I can realistically accept. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
