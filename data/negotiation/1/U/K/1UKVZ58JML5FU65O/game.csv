,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'll offer you the product for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me.  While $125 is closer, my budget is really capped at $90. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to buy.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though! I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",110.0,Alice,5,
