{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, $100 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. You have several rounds left, so it's worth trying to push for that final $2 discount."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87 is definitely getting closer, but I'm hoping we can meet at $85. This price works for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 7

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is very close to your target price, you're still determined to get it for $85. You have a few more rounds left, so it's worth seeing if you can push for that last dollar. You can also consider that John is offering the product for $80, so this is a good baseline for your negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting really close now! I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still hoping we can close this deal at my initial offer of $85.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts, Bob. After reevaluating, I am willing to sell the product at $86.50. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting close to your target, but it's still above what you're willing to pay.  You're down to your final round, and you've already spent considerable time trying to negotiate with Alice.  With John offering the product for $80, it's the most financially advantageous option at this point. You might be able to get a better deal with Alice if you have more time, but you're running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out on a good deal with John."
