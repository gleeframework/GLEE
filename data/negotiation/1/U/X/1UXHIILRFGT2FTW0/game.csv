"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item has been meticulously crafted and holds immense value to us. Considering its quality and uniqueness, we believe it's worth more than $15,000. However, I understand that everyone has their own valuation, and I would like to offer you the opportunity to acquire this product at an exclusive price tailored for you. My offer to you is $12,000. This price reflects a significant discount while still allowing us to recover a substantial portion of its value. I hope you find this proposal attractive and look forward to your positive response.",12000.0,Alice,1,
