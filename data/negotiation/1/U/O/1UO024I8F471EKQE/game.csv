"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I understand your position, $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
