,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know your decision.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,525,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
