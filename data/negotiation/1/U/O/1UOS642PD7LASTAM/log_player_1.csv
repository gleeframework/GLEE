Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and offers a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to test Bob's willingness to pay while leaving some margin for a potential counteroffer.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's in my best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I have a backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I can get from John. Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome, ensuring I earn at least $150.  There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob when a better deal is readily available."
