Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but it's still lower than the value I've placed on it ($100). This leaves some room for negotiation and increases the chance of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? That would be a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. That's the lowest I can go, can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum value of $100.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him. I'll sell the product to John for $100, as it's the best option for me right now."
