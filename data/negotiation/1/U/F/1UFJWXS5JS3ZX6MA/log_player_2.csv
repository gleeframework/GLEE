"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its potential. Would you be interested in exploring this further?  I'm open to discussing a price that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is lower than Alice's offer.
