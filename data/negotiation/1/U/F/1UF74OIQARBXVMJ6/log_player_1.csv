Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $100, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price. However, I'm willing to try and push for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway. $140 is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good price for me.  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm prepared to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still above my minimum price of $100, and it's close enough to my counteroffer of $140.  I'm going to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and secure a sale."
