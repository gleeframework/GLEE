"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1200000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1300000. How about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1250000 is still too low. I'm willing to offer a final compromise of $1275000. This reflects the product's value to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go up to $1262500. That's the highest I can go. Can you meet me there?",1262500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $1262500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1270000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get what we need.  Let's make this deal work.",1270000.0,Alice,7,
