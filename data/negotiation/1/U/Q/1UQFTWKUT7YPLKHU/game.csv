"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me and your own cost, I'd be happy to pay $750,000.  This would give you a healthy profit and allow me to secure the product at a price that makes sense for my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable accepting $750,000, as it's still below my minimum target. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's true worth to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $812,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",812500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm still not comfortable accepting $812,500, as it's still below my target. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's true worth to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would allow me to stay within my budget while ensuring a fair profit for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,6,
