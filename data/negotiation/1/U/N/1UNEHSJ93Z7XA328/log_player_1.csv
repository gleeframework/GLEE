Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm confident Bob will counter, and we can then work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise, moving slightly closer to Bob's offer while still leaving some room for negotiation. I hope this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate would likely result in a lower final price.  It's time to accept his offer and close the deal."
