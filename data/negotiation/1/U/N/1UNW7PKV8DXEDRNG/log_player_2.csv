# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. After careful consideration, I propose to sell this exceptional item to you at a price of $1,350,000. This offer reflects the significant value I believe the product holds for you, while also ensuring a fair return for my investment. I look forward to discussing the details further and hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though you want to save as much money as possible, Alice's price of $1,350,000 is still lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You can still make a profit.** The product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and you're buying it for $1,350,000, so you'll save $150,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to maximize your savings."
