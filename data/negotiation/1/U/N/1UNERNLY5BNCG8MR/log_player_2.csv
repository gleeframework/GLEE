Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. It's a slight increase, but I believe it's still a great value for you and a fair price for me.

While $1,075,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still determined to see if I can get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $1,075,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000, but I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,030,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept.
