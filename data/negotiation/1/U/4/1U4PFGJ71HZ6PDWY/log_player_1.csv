Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $110.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $110 as my offer price. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate if he feels the price is too high. 
* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob while making him feel like he's getting a good deal. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizing profit:**  $110 is a good starting point. It's a significant profit for me, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is a tough bargainer. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $80, minimizing my losses. But, there's a chance Bob will accept, allowing me to get a higher price."
