Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product is incredibly valuable and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in buying, but my absolute maximum is $12,000.  Is that something you could consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  Would you be willing to do $14,500? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll reach the $14,500 mark. Accepting his current offer means losing out on a significant amount. It's wiser to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
