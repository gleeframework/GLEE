Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product is incredibly valuable and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in buying, but my absolute maximum is $12,000.  Is that something you could consider?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 5
