"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than our maximum price. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. Could you do $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to see how low Alice is willing to go.  Starting significantly below her initial offer gives us room to negotiate.
* **Not Too Low:** Offering $85 is still a reasonable markup from Alice's value ($80), so it's possible she'll accept.
* **Polite and Open:**  Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive and increases the chance of reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob. However, I've already sold it to another buyer for $80, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I can offer you a compromise at $92, but that's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $92 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $100 and only slightly above her known value of $80. 
* **Potential Savings:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's Price:**  $92 is considerably cheaper than buying from John for $120."
