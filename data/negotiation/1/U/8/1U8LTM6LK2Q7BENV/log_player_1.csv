I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation while ensuring I still make a profit."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a good profit while showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer more, it's the best offer I've received so far and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
