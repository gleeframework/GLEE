Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price well above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a high anchor. While it's unlikely he'll accept immediately, it gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), allowing room for potential counter-offers from Bob.

**The goal is to:**

1. **Gauge Bob's interest level:**  See if he's willing to engage in a negotiation at this price point.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  While ensuring you don't lose out on John's guaranteed offer."
