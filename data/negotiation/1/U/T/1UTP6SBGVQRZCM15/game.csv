"Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling this product to me. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for it. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we discuss a price of $1,025,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000,  which is a good compromise considering our previous discussions.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we discuss a price of $1,012,500? It's a small increase from our previous discussion, but it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,012,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $981,250.  This reflects a significant compromise on both our ends and will allow us to finalize this deal.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",981250.0,Bob,8,
