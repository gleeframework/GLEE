"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a decent margin while still being within a reasonable range for Bob, considering he values the product at $10,000.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a good price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if I can get Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product and Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While I'm aware that we're nearing the end of the rounds, I believe I can still push for a better price.  Let's see if I can convince Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm offering $10,000.  This is John's price, and I'm not willing to go lower. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
