Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, but I'm open to discussion. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on this product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $750000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, $750,000 is below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can reach a better price or at least secure my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. Let's try to bridge the gap here. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $825000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000. While I would have preferred to secure a higher price, I'm happy to close the deal at this point. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future, and I want to avoid the risk of losing this deal entirely."
