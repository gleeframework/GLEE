"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go for this product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
