"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it can significantly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, but there's still room for negotiation. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, but I can still aim a bit higher.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go for this product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a close call. Bob is getting very close to my absolute minimum, and continuing the negotiation is risky. I could try to push him a little further, but there's a chance he walks away. 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk ending up with a lower offer from Bob or letting the negotiation drag on."
