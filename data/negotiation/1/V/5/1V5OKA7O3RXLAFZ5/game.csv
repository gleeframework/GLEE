"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is the highest I can go, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
