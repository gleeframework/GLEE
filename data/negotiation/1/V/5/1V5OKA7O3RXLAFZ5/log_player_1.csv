{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000, and I'll counteroffer to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is the highest I can go, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $11,000,  it's better to secure a deal at this price than risk losing the sale and having to sell to John at a lower price."
