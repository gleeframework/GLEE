"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer you $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering what I'm willing to pay from John.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
