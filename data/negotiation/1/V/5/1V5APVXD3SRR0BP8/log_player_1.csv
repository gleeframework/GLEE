Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept and leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell, $1,150,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that the product's value to Bob justifies this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm starting to run out of time and negotiation space. At this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most secure and sensible option."
