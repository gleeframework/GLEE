,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product very worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this offer agreeable.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
