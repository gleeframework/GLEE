Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm using the ""great deal"" language to try to encourage Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to counteroffer if necessary.  I'm also keeping in mind the value of the product to me and John, as I may need to accept a lower price than I'd like to avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's higher than his initial perceived value, it's still far below what the product is worth to me.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by counter-offering. I'll try to bridge the gap while still securing a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product very worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise and highlighting the value of the product, I can persuade Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this offer agreeable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's starting to feel like we're near a deal.  While I'd ideally get closer to $12,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether or having to sell to John. Accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit, and it's better than risking a lower price or a delayed sale."
