"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't afford $11000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10250?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the product's value.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe we can reach a fair agreement. Could we meet at $10000 for the product? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",10000.0,Bob,4,
