"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a high starting point, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to counteroffer.  If he's not interested at this price, I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see where he stands first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I don't know his true value for the product, I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.  I'll reject his offer for now and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it shows that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm still aiming to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also aware that I need to be reasonable to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Although I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm happy to accept this offer to secure the deal.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
