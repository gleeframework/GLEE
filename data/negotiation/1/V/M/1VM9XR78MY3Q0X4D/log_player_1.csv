I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price a bit, showing flexibility but still aiming for a good profit. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to close the deal."

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I think I can still push for more, especially since I have several rounds left."

I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm getting closer to his offer.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's too low for me."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. We're getting close to my minimum and it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I'm happy with $1,080,000, especially since I have a backup offer from John.  I need to make a decision and I'd rather secure the deal with Bob than risk losing both."
