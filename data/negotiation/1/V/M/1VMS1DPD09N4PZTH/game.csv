"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit steep, but $950,000 is a bit low for my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,025,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. ",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a bit above your last offer, but it's still below my target price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
