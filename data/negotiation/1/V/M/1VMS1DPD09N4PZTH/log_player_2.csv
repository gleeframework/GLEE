"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You are trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit steep, but $950,000 is a bit low for my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,025,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget, it's still above your target. You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a bit above your last offer, but it's still below my target price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
