Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay up to $850,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the middle ground you've proposed, but I'm still looking to stay within my price range. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $860,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to $900,000, Bob's offer of $860,000 is a fair compromise and a better outcome than selling to John for $800,000."
