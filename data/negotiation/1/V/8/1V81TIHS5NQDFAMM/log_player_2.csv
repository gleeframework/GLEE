"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than his maximum budget, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible, and he knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's value to her, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target price. He has several rounds left, so there's still time to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer from $10,500 to $11,000, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. This offer is still below Alice's counteroffer, but it's getting closer to a possible agreement.  Bob is hoping Alice will accept, but he's prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,800 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit high.  Bob has several rounds left and can continue to negotiate. There's still potential for Alice to lower her price, especially since she's already rejected his counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he's willing to compromise while still trying to get the best price.  $11,200 is a midpoint between his last offer and Alice's last offer, making it a reasonable counteroffer. Bob hopes this will be enough to sway Alice, but he's prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,400. While this is still slightly above Bob's desired price, it's a good deal considering:

* **Time:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will lower the price further. He risks losing the opportunity to buy from her and potentially needing to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Progress:**  Alice has consistently reduced her price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.

Accepting the offer at $11,400 ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, saving him $3,600 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of losing the deal and needing to buy at a higher price is not worth the potential for a slightly lower price."
