"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,300,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** John's price is your absolute maximum, so you want to exhaust all other options first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a range that's potentially acceptable to her. She needs to make a profit, but you also want to save money. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Alice room to counter with a higher price, but you've shown that you're serious about negotiating.
* **Avoids immediate rejection:**  A lower counteroffer might immediately be rejected, but this price is still significantly less than her offer, giving her some incentive to consider it."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and there's a possibility she might come down further.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  While John's price is high, you're not desperate enough to buy immediately."

* **Testing the waters:**  It's close enough to Alice's latest offer that she might be willing to accept it.
