"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You know you can get the product from John for $1,200,000. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
