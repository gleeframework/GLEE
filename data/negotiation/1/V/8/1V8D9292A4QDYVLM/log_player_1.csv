Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my opening offer to Bob. I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $10,000 if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than John's $10,000, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on the value I believe the product has."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $13,500 is a good price and a decent compromise. It's much better than selling to John for $10,000, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
