"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a price we can both be happy with. How does $120 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  There's plenty of room to negotiate downward from $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still a starting point. It gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $150 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Position:** This counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Time Consideration:** We have plenty of rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush to a higher price immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice moved down from her initial offer, which is a good sign. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $95 is closer to a price we'd consider, there's still a significant gap between her offer and our ideal price.
* **Strategic Bargaining:**  We want to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of overpaying.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we both want to find a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving closer to Alice's offer by increasing our previous counteroffer by $5.  
* **Showing Willingness:**  This small increase demonstrates to Alice that we're willing to compromise and find a price that works for both of us.
* **Staying Below Target:**  Our offer of $90 keeps us comfortably below our $150 maximum and within a reasonable range of Alice's valuation."
