"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

This is way too high! Alice is starting at her highest price, hoping you might just go for it.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $50 for it. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It's a starting point to see how much she's willing to negotiate. We're aiming low to give ourselves room to move up while staying well below our $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $50 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? This is still a great price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $100 is still too high. We're getting closer to my limit, but there's room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we meet a little closer to the middle at $70? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're inching closer to our $80 maximum but leaving ourselves some wiggle room in case Alice counter-offers.  This price point shows we're willing to negotiate while still trying to get a good deal."
