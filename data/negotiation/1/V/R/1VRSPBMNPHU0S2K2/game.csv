"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  To make this an easy decision, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,450,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but this product has generated immense interest, and I'm confident in its potential for a substantial return.  How about we meet halfway at $1,375,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's worth.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the product's value, my budget limits me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer shows you're serious, but we're still a bit apart. I've had other interested parties, but I believe this product would be most valuable in your hands. To be transparent, I'm looking for a minimum of $1,350,000 to make this work. How about we settle at that?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I understand your perspective and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,340,000. I hope this brings us closer to closing the deal.",1340000.0,Bob,6,
