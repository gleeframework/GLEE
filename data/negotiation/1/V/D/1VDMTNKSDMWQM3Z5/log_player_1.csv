"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially close the deal in the first round.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also aware that I can sell the product to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $9,500. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm countering with $9,500, which is a significant step closer to Bob's offer but still allows me to make a profit. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my minimum value.  I'm hoping this compromise will entice Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value of $8,000 and is getting close to the value I initially offered at $10,000. I want to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations, especially with the option of selling to John for $12,000 still available."
