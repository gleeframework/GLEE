"Alice, $10,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 right now. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $9,500. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
