"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and features of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is closer to my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
