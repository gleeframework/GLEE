Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and features of the product.

While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above my budget. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the quality and features of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

While $10,500 is tempting, it's still higher than my preferred budget. I've already spent several rounds negotiating and I'm not confident Alice will go lower. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000."
