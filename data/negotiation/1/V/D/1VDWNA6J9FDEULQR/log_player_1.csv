Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $110 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $80. Would you consider $70?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Explanation: Bob is clearly anchored at his $80 valuation and is unlikely to move significantly higher.  Continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly better price than $75, but it's not worth the risk of ending up with a worse deal. Accepting John's guaranteed $120 is the best option at this point."
