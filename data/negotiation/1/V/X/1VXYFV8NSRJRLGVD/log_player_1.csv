Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $80, so he has room to negotiate up.
* **Is below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $120, so you are not losing money. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price a bit, but you have room to do so.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still being able to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your minimum, you can likely still get a better deal. You know John is willing to pay $120, so you have leverage. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $95. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate further.
* **Is still above your minimum:** You're not losing money, but you're getting closer to Bob's value. 
* **Provides a clear next step:** You're offering a specific price point, making it easy for Bob to decide.

Let's see how Bob reacts to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $92? It's getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially get a little more, it's important to consider the following:

* **Time:** Each round of negotiation takes time. 
* **Risk:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept a higher counteroffer.
* **John:** John is a guaranteed sale, but at a higher price.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale quickly and earn a profit that's still above your minimum.  The time saved could potentially be used to find another buyer for a future product."
