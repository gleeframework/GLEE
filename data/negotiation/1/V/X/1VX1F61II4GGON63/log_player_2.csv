"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price further.
* **John is a backup:**  The option to buy from John for $15,000 is a safety net, ensuring Bob can acquire the product if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This is a competitive offer considering its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise, closer to Bob's desired price point. 
* **Potential savings:**  While still above Bob's ideal price, accepting this offer saves $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but also risks Alice walking away or Bob losing out to John. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option, balancing savings and the risk of further negotiation."
