Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product at a price of $16,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a higher offer than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Potential Profit:** Offering the product at $16,000 leaves room for a potential $4,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as Backup:** You have the security of knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 if Bob declines, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can adjust your price based on his response and how much you believe he's willing to pay."
