"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice's initial offer is $12,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting. By rejecting, you have the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Alice's perceived value ($10,000) but significantly lower than your maximum budget ($12,000). This allows for potential compromise and shows a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and accepting this offer ensures you get the product while still saving some money."
