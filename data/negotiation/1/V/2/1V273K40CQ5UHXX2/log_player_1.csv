Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My starting price is $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, knowing my minimum is $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and hopefully makes him feel more comfortable negotiating.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** I'm clear that I'm open to negotiation, which could lead to a better price for both of us.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup for $80 gives me confidence to hold out for a higher price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still potential to get a better price. 
* **Goal is Maximum Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer gives me a chance to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $80 means I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a bit closer to my initial price. How about $95? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to negotiate. Offering $95 is a slight compromise that demonstrates flexibility.
* **High But Reasonable:** $95 is still above my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message keeps the negotiation amicable and potentially motivates Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? It's a small compromise, but it's still a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** $92 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than my minimum of $80.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try for a bit more, there's a chance Bob will walk away. It's better to secure a good deal than risk losing him completely.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and I have John as a backup. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
