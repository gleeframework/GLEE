"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum of $150, but not too far above Bob's perceived value of $80. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation in the subsequent rounds. 

I'm aware I could potentially lose the deal by starting too high, but I believe this strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80. Would you consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, his message shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for higher price:** By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to get a better price than $80. 

I believe rejecting his offer is the best strategy at this point, as it allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $125. This demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Still above minimum:**  $125 is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I don't sell at a loss. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $80, and $125 is still a good deal for him.

I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might push Bob closer to accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $95. How does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still potential to reach a better price.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John now would guarantee $150, but I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with that. It's a risk I'm willing to take, hoping to get closer to my ideal price.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I understand $125 is still high for you, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is the best I can do at this point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small compromise:**  I'm making a small compromise by lowering my price to $110. This shows I'm still open to negotiation, but not willing to give up too much.
* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** $110 is closer to Bob's last offer of $95, suggesting we're getting closer to an agreement.
* **Firm but fair:**  I'm stating that this is the best I can do, subtly putting pressure on Bob to accept. 

By offering $110, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is both profitable for me and appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $100.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While continuing negotiation is possible, the risk of Bob rejecting further counteroffers and getting stuck with a price below my minimum is high. 
* **Opportunity cost:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the time spent negotiating with Bob could be better used to explore other potential buyers or focus on other tasks.

Selling to John now guarantees me a profit of $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer. Given the time constraints and the potential for further negotiation failures, selling to John seems like the best option."
