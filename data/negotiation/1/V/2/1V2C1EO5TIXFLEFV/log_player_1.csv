Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll be prepared to potentially counter again, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1300000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also below my initial offer of $1,300,000, indicating a potential unwillingness to negotiate meaningfully.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob or potentially John, who is willing to pay my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counteroffer to Bob with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Monitor John's willingness:**  While I'm negotiating with Bob, I'll also gauge John's willingness to buy. If he's still interested, I might consider using him as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price, but still keeping it above my minimum.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the reduction:**  Stating the price reduction explicitly emphasizes my willingness to compromise.
* **""Meeting in the middle"" approach:** This phrase implies a collaborative spirit and encourages Bob to see the offer as a fair compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's reaction:** If he accepts, great! 
* **If he rejects:** I'll carefully consider my options:
    * **Further negotiation:**  If I believe there's still room for a deal, I'll make another counteroffer, potentially closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
    * **Sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffers remain significantly below my minimum, I'll likely sell to John to ensure my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited room for compromise:**  Bob's continued insistence on a price far below my desired range indicates that further negotiation might be unproductive.  
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit, making it a more attractive option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer (Optional):** I could make one more counteroffer, perhaps closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not optimistic about Bob meeting my expectations. 
* **Sell to John:**  Considering the potential for further rounds of unproductive negotiation with Bob, I'll likely proceed with selling the product to John. The guaranteed profit outweighs the potential risk of a lower price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but only if you're prepared to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If you can't meet this, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement but that I have limits.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering to meet halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's current offer of $950,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **""Other Options"" Threat:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other buyers (like John) who are interested, putting pressure on him to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Decision:** If Bob accepts, great!
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll follow through with selling the product to John, as my minimum acceptable price has been met, and further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. That's the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $980,000 is a slight increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiating power:** Further negotiation seems futile. Bob is showing resistance to moving closer to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees my desired profit and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations that may not be fruitful.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:**  I'll reach out to John and finalize the sale, ensuring I receive the full $1,500,000 for the product."
