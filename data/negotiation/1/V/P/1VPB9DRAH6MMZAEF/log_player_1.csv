Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It sets a clear starting point:** By stating a price, you're leading the negotiation and prompting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm interested in the product but I'm not sure I can go that high. Would you be willing to accept $90 for it?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80 and is closer to your initial offer of $100. Accepting his offer is a good choice in this scenario."
