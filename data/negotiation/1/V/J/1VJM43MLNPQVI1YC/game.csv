"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $6,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,000 for the product. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,3,
