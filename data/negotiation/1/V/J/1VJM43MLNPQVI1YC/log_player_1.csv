"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, as it's likely he won't accept the initial price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (or lack thereof).  If he rejects my offer, I'll consider lowering the price slightly in the next round, but I won't go below my minimum of $12,000.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation.  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. I'm not desperate to sell to him. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll keep in mind the value of the product to Bob ($8,000) and the fact that I can sell to John for $12,000. I'll try to reach a deal that benefits both of us, while ensuring I don't lose out financially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $6,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,000 for the product. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but countering with a price closer to my desired value. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair offer:**  $8,000 is the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's initial offer. It's a fair price that should be appealing to him.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing that this is still a ""great price"" for Bob, further encouraging him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll finalize the deal.  If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and determine whether it's worth continuing the negotiation.  John's offer remains a backup option if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
