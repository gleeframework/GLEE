"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should aim to get closer to our $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** We start with a significantly lower counteroffer ($6,000) to signal our budget limitations and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  We maintain a positive tone, expressing continued interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts pressure on Alice. She can either move closer to our price or risk us walking away and buying from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $6,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,000 for the product. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice has met our ideal price of $8,000. 
* **No Benefit to Delay:**  We have no incentive to negotiate further since John's offer is also $8,000. 
* **Secure the Deal:** Accepting now guarantees we get the product at our target price."
