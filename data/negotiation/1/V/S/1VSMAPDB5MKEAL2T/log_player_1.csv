{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing you to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below what you're comfortable with.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum price, it's still below your comfort zone and the negotiation seems to be going in circles. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is a much better outcome for you. It's time to take the sure thing."
