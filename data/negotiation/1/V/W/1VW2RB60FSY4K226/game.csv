"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $825000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to let it go for.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit tight on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $810000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value.",810000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $815000?
