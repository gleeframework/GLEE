Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $80. I can offer you a compromise at $90. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?
