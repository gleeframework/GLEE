"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the details of this incredible product with you, Bob! I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. As we've discussed, this product is truly one-of-a-kind and I'm willing to offer it to you for a competitive price of $950000. This is a significant discount from its true value to you, which I understand is $1000000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
