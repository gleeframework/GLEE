"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we compromise at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the negotiation, Bob. While $925,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,5,
