"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that it's a great product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm afraid I can't accept $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a new price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is very close to what I can manage.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $825,000 and we have a deal?",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a new price of $850,000. I believe this is the best we can do without compromising the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,7,
