# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it.

It's time to cut bait. Alice seems firm at $850,000 and is unlikely to budge further. Taking the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000 is the best move to ensure you stay within your budget."
