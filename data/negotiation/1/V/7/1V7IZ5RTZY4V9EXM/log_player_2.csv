"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start negotiations lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals you're looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating the counteroffer is too high.
* **Strategic Positioning:** An $110 counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's $140. It aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a price very favorable to us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? That gives us both a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $125 is closer to our target, we're still in the early rounds of negotiation. Alice's willingness to move down suggests there's more flexibility in her price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Having the option to buy from John for $150 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to accept a price that's not ideal.
* **Aiming for Closer to $110:** Our initial offer aimed to test the waters. Now we know Alice is willing to negotiate, we can push for a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $115. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** Rather than jumping back and forth with large price differences, we're incrementally moving towards our desired price range.
* **Clear Target:** We're explicitly stating our target price of $115, making it clear what we're aiming for.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is our goal, we're still open to a price slightly above that, especially if Alice seems firm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $120. This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Price:**  $120 is likely the lowest Alice is willing to go. It's also her break-even point, meaning she won't make a profit if she goes lower.
* **Excellent Deal:**  Getting the product for $120 is a great deal, well below our $150 maximum and saving us a significant amount.
* **No Guarantee of a Better Offer:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might become less flexible, and we risk reaching a stalemate, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price."
