Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $130 is above your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $130 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for you to move a bit lower if Bob counters, or for him to move higher if he's very eager."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay closer to $110.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, there is still room to get a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 120}
