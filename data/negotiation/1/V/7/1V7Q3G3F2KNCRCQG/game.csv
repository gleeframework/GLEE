"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's start with a price of $1,250,000. I think this is a fair starting point for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to make this deal happen, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value.  Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This feels like a good compromise for both of us, and it allows us to move closer to a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
