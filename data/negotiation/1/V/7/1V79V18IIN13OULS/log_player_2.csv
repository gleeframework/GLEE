"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you is substantial. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the product's value to Alice is lower, Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
