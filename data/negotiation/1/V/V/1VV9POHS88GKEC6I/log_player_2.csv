"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to spend a maximum of $100, and her offer is $30 above that.
* **Rejecting the offer is the best strategy in this round.**  It allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  However, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, as you might be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** My goal is to save as much money as possible, so I'm starting with a low counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $90 is still a fair price for Alice, considering she values the product at $120. This gives her some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save money. 
* **Exploring the limits:** By making a counteroffer, I'm testing the waters and seeing how willing Alice is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $100.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.** This allows me to continue exploring potential lower prices with Alice.
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's not the best choice yet.**  By rejecting the offer, I maintain the possibility of getting a better price from Alice without risking missing out on a deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's offer:** My previous offer of $90 was rejected, indicating Alice might be willing to accept a price closer to her initial offer of $115.
* **Moderate increase:** Increasing my offer to $95 demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below my maximum budget.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By offering a slightly higher price, I'm putting pressure on Alice to accept the offer.  This encourages her to consider my offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above my budget.** While she's coming down in price, $110 is still too high for me.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a safe option, but I'm not ready to give up yet.** If I keep rejecting Alice's offers, she may be forced to lower her price to $100 or less, allowing me to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident that Alice will accept it.
* **Closing the deal:** This offer shows my willingness to compromise while also securing a price that works for me.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While buying from John for $100 is a safe option, I'm hoping to get the product from Alice for the same price without going through another seller."
