"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's better to buy from John at $1,200,000.  While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum, you can get the product for $1 less from John.  There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially end up paying more or wasting time."
