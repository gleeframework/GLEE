{""product_price"": 1,600,000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm starting to run out of rounds. With only 3 rounds left, I'm concerned that I won't be able to negotiate a price lower than $1,700,000.  It's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to get the product for my target price of $1,500,000.  

To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product, I'm going to buy it from John for $1,500,000.  While it's not the best deal, it's a guaranteed outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the product altogether."
