"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $180 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my asking price. How about $190?  It's still a fair deal for both of us, and it reflects the real value of this product. What do you think?",190.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $175 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference and go with $185. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",185.0,Alice,5,
