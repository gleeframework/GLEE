"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $200. I believe it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's common in negotiations to start with a higher price to leave room for bargaining.  
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still allowing for flexibility during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $180 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for you:** The product is worth at least $150 to you, and Bob's offer of $180 is only slightly above that minimum. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate and potentially increase the price.  
* **Potential for better deal:** With 8 rounds left, there's a chance Bob might be willing to increase his offer or you might find a buyer who values the product more.

While $180 is a decent price, it's worth seeing if a better deal can be reached within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my asking price. How about $190?  It's still a fair deal for both of us, and it reflects the real value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 190}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  Instead of immediately dropping to Bob's price, I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to my original price but still demonstrates flexibility.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to discussion:** The message ends with a question to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $200."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still a bit far from $190. How about we meet at $175? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for you:**  Even though Bob is offering a price slightly above your minimum, you still have 6 rounds left. This means there's a good chance of getting a better deal. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob is demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to your original price.  It's worth pushing for a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a sale, but there's a chance to potentially get more from Bob.

With 6 rounds left, continuing to negotiate is a better option than settling for $175. There's a strong chance you can secure a price closer to $190 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $175 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference and go with $185. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 185}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Fairness and value:** I emphasize that the price is fair for both of us and highlights the value of the product.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm aiming for a final price in this round, but leaving room for one more counteroffer if needed.

This strategy tries to close the deal while leaving a small margin for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, and $185 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $180? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for you:** Bob's offer of $180 is above your minimum selling price of $150 and only $5 less than your desired price.
* **Limited rounds:** You only have 4 rounds left, and with each round, the risk of losing the deal increases.
* **Potential for John:** While John is a guaranteed buyer, his offer is lower than Bob's current offer.

Considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of getting a lower offer from John, accepting Bob's offer at $180 seems like the best option to secure a good sale quickly."
