"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $12,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",12000.0,Alice,3,
