"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you close to your last offer.  Would you consider $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my last offer, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I can do $12,000, but I think we're getting close. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to come down a bit more.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $12,200, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",12200.0,Alice,9,
