Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $140 is still too high for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $130?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $135? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
$135 is still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the product to John or wasting more time negotiating.  Let's close the deal!"
