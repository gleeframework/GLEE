Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value *to you*, the phrase ""given its value"" subtly hints at its worth, justifying the higher price. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you know he might be very price-sensitive and you can adjust accordingly. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000.  This knowledge gives you the confidence to aim higher with Bob."
