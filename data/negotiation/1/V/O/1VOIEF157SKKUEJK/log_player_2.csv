"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's first offer is already a good deal, but there's a chance I could get it for even less. It's worth making a counteroffer to see if she's willing to go lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, coming down to $11,000.  There's still room to push for a better price before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:

Alice is down to $10,750, and she's signaled that this is her final offer. While I could try to haggle further, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better price from her. Accepting this offer is a good compromise between getting a discount and ensuring I secure the product."
