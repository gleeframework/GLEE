"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but  $11,500 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",10750.0,Alice,5,
