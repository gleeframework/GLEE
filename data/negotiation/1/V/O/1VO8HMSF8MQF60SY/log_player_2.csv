"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Alice's offer is a good compromise:** While Bob initially wanted $10,000, Alice is now willing to meet halfway.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will get a lower price in subsequent rounds. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a longer negotiation or paying the higher price from John."
