Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob for a higher price, the negotiation has stalled, and I'm not confident that I can get him to budge much further.  It's better to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
