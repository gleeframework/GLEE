"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and both Alice and John are selling at that price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  You can get the product for the same price from John."
