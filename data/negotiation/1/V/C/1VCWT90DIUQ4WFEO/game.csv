"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is still well below my maximum budget and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,075,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this out!",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1,062,500, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",1062500.0,Alice,7,
