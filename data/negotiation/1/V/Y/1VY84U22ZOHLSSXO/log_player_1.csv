Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
