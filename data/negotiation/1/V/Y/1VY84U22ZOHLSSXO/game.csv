"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is right at the edge of my budget and represents a fair price for both of us. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and efficiently. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a warranty and support package, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
