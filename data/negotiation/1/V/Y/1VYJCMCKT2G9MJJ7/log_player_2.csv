"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which still allows you a healthy profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move forward, I could consider $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my target price. However, I still have 7 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price. It's worth exploring counter-offers and seeing if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations. I'm confident this will be a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,325,000, which is closer to my target price and within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice walking away altogether is high. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
