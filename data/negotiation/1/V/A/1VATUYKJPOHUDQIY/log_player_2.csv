"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,000,000. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and this price represents a great value. I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John for $800,000 saves you $200,000, which is the best use of your money in this scenario."
