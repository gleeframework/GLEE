Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)"":**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 would theoretically work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high is generally a good strategy. However, being too aggressive could lead Bob to reject the offer. 

**Offer**

Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're not starting with a lowball offer, showing you value the product.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're hinting at the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly reminding Bob why he's interested.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While you're aiming high, you've left some room for Bob to negotiate, making it more likely he'll engage rather than walking away.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
