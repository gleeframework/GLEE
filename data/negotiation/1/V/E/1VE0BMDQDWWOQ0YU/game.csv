"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me.  To be frank, it's worth a great deal to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter, but $950,000 is considerably less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle; would you consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me here.  That being said, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $1,000,000 even? That's a fair offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
