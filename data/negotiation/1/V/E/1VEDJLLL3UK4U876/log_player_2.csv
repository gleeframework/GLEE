"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal that works for both of us. I'll sell it to you for $999000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm excited to consider Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, she's already giving me a significant discount by offering it to me for $999,000. However, I can get it from John for $1,000,000, so I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get an even better deal.
