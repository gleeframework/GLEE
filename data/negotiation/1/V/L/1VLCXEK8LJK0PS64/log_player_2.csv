"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can likely get a better deal than $750,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd love to get it lower, it's still a significant savings over John's price, and a fair deal considering the value to me."
