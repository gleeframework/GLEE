"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable for your business.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the immense value you'll get from it.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. Given the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $950,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to find a way to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a very reasonable price given the product's immense value and potential. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
