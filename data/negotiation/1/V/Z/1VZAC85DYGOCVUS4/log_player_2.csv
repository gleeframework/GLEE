{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. Given the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's a significant concession from her initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There are more rounds available, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about $950,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to find a way to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a very reasonable price given the product's immense value and potential. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget.  It's a good deal for Bob, as he's getting the product at his target price.  While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers and he might end up buying from John at the same price.  It's a good time to accept and close the deal."
