"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can save money by rejecting and making a counteroffer. While you could buy from John for $1,200,000, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a very competitive price considering the substantial benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's still better than buying from John at $1,200,000."
