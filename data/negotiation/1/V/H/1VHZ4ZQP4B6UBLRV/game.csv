"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This represents a fair price that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a very competitive price considering the substantial benefits you'll gain.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
