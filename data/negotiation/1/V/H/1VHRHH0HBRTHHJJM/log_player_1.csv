Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $85 is a fair offer, I'm looking to get closer to $90. How about we split the difference and settle at $87.50?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:

Bob is steadily coming up, and we're still significantly above our fallback price with John.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I want to make a deal happen. Let's settle this right now - $85.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure and Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and signaling I'm firm on this price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** I'm conceding a bit more to meet him closer to his previous offer while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Time Value:**  The longer this drags on, the less likely we are to reach a deal. A faster sale, even slightly lower, is better than no sale at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Equal Value:** Bob's offer now matches what John is offering. 
* **No More Upside:**  Bob has consistently moved upward in his offers, but it's unlikely he'll go above $80. 
* **Time Saved:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks a stalemate, wasting valuable time I could use to find other potential buyers."
