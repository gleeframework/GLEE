"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we split the difference a little closer to my initial offer? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that allows you a healthy profit while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
