"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than it does for me.  Given that, my initial offer is $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is still quite high, and Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your initial offer, I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you and allows us to come to a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's commitment to negotiating.  It's a fair starting point for a counteroffer, given Alice's minimum value for the product is $800,000.  Bob leaves room for negotiation, but still makes a strong initial stance."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that allows you a healthy profit while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```
