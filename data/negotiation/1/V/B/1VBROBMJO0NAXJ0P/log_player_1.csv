"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net in case the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price from him. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Even though I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not closing the door on selling to John. He remains a strong backup option if the negotiations with Bob fall apart.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 3 and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still below my perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price point significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a ""great deal"" for him, highlighting the benefits of the product to incentivize him to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll continue to negotiate with him, keeping John as a backup in case the deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below Minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still some room to negotiate, especially considering the remaining rounds.
* **John is a Strong Backup:** John remains a strong backup option, ensuring I can secure my desired price if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 5 and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum but still higher than his offer.  I'll aim to find a compromise point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's latest offer ($9,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity and making it less likely he'll feel pressured or taken advantage of.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive relationship and keep the negotiations moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further if necessary. However, if he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob,  I can't afford to lose too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $9,200 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only four rounds remaining, the pressure is on to get a better deal.  Accepting Bob's offer now would result in a substantial loss.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer remains a strong alternative, providing a much more favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 7 and counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his last offer but still below my perceived value of the product.  I'll aim for a compromise point that's closer to my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John as we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer the product for $9,600. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 9600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer again, aiming for a middle ground. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and reach a deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds remaining, I'm trying to make a final push to close the deal.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and reiterating that this is a good price.
* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this offer as my best possible price, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round, as the time is running out, and I need to secure a price closer to my desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $9,600 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds left, the time is running out to secure a deal that meets my minimum price. 
* **Bob's Stubbornness:**  Bob's persistence in offering only $9,000 shows he's unlikely to budge significantly further. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 is significantly more profitable than Bob's current offer.

**Conclusion:** 

It's becoming increasingly clear that I won't be able to reach a deal with Bob that meets my minimum requirements. To maximize my profit and ensure a good outcome, I will sell the product to John."
