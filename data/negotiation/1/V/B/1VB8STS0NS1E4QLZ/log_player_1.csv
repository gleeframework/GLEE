Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it might be worth more than Bob's estimated $15,000, justifying the higher price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly stated, the message hints that if Bob declines, the product will be sold elsewhere, potentially creating a sense of urgency.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable given the product's value to him."
