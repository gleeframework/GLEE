"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you.  This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm offering it to you at $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a substantial advantage. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe you'll find this offer too good to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to create urgency, her offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
