Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500. "", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but you have a cushion to work with.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's $8,000, ensuring you don't undervalue the product if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is a single offer strategy. A more complex approach might involve multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers to feel out Bob's willingness to pay."
