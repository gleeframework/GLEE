"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer of $11,500 is higher than Alice's valuation, it's still less than your maximum price of $12,000 and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $500."
