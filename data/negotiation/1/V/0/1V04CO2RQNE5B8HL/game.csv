"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your perspective, $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm seeking.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your persistence.  However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, but I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you place on the product.  Let's reach an agreement on this price and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,5,
