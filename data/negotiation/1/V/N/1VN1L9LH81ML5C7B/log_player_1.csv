Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
