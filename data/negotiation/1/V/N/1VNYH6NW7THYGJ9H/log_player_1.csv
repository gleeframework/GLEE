"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  This price is a strong opening point and gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm still aiming for a profit, but I'm willing to lower my price slightly to keep the negotiation going.  $900,000 is a good compromise that hopefully encourages Bob to come closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly better than John's offer and still a decent profit for me. I'll accept his offer and move on."
