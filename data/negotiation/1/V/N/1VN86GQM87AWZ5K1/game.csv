"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Would you be willing to accept that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below what I need to consider. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. However, $825,000 is still a bit too far from what I need to accept.  How about we meet at $850,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it gives me a better return on my investment.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,7,
