"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
