,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about $130? That's still a good price for a quality product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $130. How about $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $115 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  This product is really high-quality, and I'm already compromising.  Would you be willing to go to $118?  That's just a little more, but I think it's fair considering the value you're getting.",118.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that the product is high-quality, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $118. How about $116.50?",116.5,Bob,6,
