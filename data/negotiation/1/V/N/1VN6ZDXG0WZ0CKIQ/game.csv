"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value extends beyond the $1,200,000 mark for me due to its unique potential in my own operations.  How about we settle at $1,600,000? This price reflects a more accurate compromise considering its long-term worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's potential, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your initial offer was $1,800,000 and your new offer is $1,600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a price of $1,520,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1520000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in reaching a deal.  While $1,520,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident that the product's unique value justifies a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,560,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and reflects the product's true potential.",1560000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your initial offer was $1,800,000 and your new offer is $1,560,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a price of $1,680,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1680000.0,Bob,6,
