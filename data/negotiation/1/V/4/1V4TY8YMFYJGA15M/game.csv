"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
