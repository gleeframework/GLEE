"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,500,000 is above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. There's still room for negotiation. It's worth continuing to counter-offer and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly.  However, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal. Let's close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept anything below $1,275,000. This offer reflects the value this product brings.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. However, it is significantly closer to Bob's limit. It's worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate, but if the next round doesn't lead to a better price, Bob might consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
