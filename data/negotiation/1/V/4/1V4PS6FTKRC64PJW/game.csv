"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, which is $1200000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering your value and my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1075000. This is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1075000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $975000, which is closer to my original offer. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $975000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1031250. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1031250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $1031250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to accept $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is the same price I offered in round 3. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
