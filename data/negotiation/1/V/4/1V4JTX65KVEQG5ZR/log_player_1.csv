Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects a fair price that acknowledges its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, it makes sense to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob, who might counter with a lower offer but still above your minimum. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
