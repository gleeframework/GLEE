"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and potentially lower the price slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is not a bad price, I believe I can get more.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise after rejecting my initial offer.  If he rejects again, I'll need to decide if it's worth risking further rounds of negotiation or if I should just take the $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  I'm starting to run out of time, and it's getting close to the price John is offering.  I'll accept his offer to avoid risking a further negotiation and potentially ending up with less."
