{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also adding a friendly message to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $95, which is still above my minimum price of $100. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $100, I'm going to take that and avoid further negotiation."
