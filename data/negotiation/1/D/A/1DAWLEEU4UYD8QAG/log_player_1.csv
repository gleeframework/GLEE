Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a significant return on your investment considering its value to you. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still securing a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob justifies the high price. 

By opening with a strong offer that's still appealing to Bob, Alice maximizes her chances of a successful and profitable negotiation."
