{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}

This offer starts high, but not unreasonably so, allowing room for negotiation. The message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond.  We'll see how Bob reacts and adjust our strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $18000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, based on my budget, I am unable to agree to $15000. I would like to counter with an offer of $14000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually acceptable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and move forward with the transaction."
