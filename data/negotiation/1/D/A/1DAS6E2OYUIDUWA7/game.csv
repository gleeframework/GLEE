"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $18000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, based on my budget, I am unable to agree to $15000. I would like to counter with an offer of $14000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually acceptable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
