Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to counteroffer.
* **It's below my minimum:**  This ensures I'm still making a profit if Bob accepts the initial offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth exchange to potentially reach a price closer to my desired $15,000. 

Remember, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount.  I still want to try and maximize my profit, but I'll need to be strategic about my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I've chosen to counter with $11,500 for a few reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate and gives Bob a better chance of feeling like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's still above my minimum:** This ensures I'm still making a profit even if Bob accepts this counteroffer.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** This allows for more back-and-forth if Bob isn't happy with the price yet.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful sale while still respecting my need to make a decent profit."
