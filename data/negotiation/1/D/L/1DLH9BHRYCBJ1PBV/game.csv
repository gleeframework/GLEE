"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000, reflecting your interest and the value of the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if this works for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,575,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1575000.0,Bob,4,
