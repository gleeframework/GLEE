"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975000?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $975000, which is $1012500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  While $1012500 is closer to what I'd like, it's still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $990000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $990000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1012500 and $990000, which is $1006250. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1006250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I see we're getting closer, $1006250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $995000, but I'm firm on that number.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",995000.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, we've been through a lot of back and forth, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,10,
