"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a chance that he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on a profit. $1,250,000 is a fair compromise, given that I need to make at least $1,200,000. If Bob still rejects, I might reconsider selling to John to avoid further negotiation risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'm not comfortable with the risk of further negotiation with Bob and losing more time. However, I believe I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to close the deal this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but I'm still aiming for a profit. This offer is a significant step towards closing the deal. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, as I'm starting to run out of time. If he rejects again, I might seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not happy with it. I want to see if I can push for a little more.  I'll counteroffer one last time before seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept.  If he rejects, I will sell to John and avoid further risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we are running out of rounds.  I'm no longer confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to risk losing any more time.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
