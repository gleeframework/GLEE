"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to acquire this product at a more competitive price point. Considering the market value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1200000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $1250000? This is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1250000 is still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $1300000. This is my final offer - let's see if we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
