"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $150.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price or if he'll counter with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also less than what John is offering.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm counter-offering with $180.  This is still a good profit for me and is closer to my initial offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell it at such a significant loss.  I'll reject his offer and try again with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $160. This is a significant concession from my previous offer of $180. I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate and that I'm open to finding a solution.  While I'm still above my minimum of $150, I'm getting closer to John's offer and need to be more flexible to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. I've made significant concessions, but it seems like we're at an impasse.  Rather than risk another round of low offers, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I make my minimum profit, and saves me time and effort in further negotiations."
