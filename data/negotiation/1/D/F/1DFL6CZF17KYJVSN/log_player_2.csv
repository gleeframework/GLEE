"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description] that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it. This is a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's original offer, it's still higher than your maximum of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price you're comfortable with."
