"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
