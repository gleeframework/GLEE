Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 90}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $85. Since $85 is higher than my minimum price of $80, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, so I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll make a new counteroffer to try to get a better price."
