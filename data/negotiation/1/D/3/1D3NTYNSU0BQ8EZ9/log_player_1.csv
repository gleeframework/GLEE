Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another party."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,300,000 allows room for negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the limited-time offer and John's existing offer creates a sense of urgency and value. 
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's worth without explicitly stating a number Bob might find unreasonable.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
