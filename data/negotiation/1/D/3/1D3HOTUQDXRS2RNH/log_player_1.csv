"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range given my minimum desired price. 
* **Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""steal"" to incentivize Bob and make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the mutual benefit aspect of the deal to build rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is open to negotiation, allowing Bob to counteroffer without feeling pressured.

**Strategy:**  By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. However, if Bob rejects my offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is significant, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and $950,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's room to get closer to my target price.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit, there's still a chance to secure a better deal with Bob through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired price but still within a range that makes sense given his budget constraints. I'll also try to understand his specific budget limitations and see if there's a way to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget concerns.  While $950,000 is tempting, it's a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that still allows you to get a valuable product within your budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise to emphasize the mutual benefit.
* **Budget Considerations:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still aiming for a price closer to my desired goal.
* **Remaining Flexible:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation by saying ""how about"" instead of stating this as a firm price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to maintain my position while still offering a potential deal to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate but remain prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on a price of $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum desired price. 
* **No Further Gain:**  There's no realistic chance of getting a higher price from Bob, as he's already reached his perceived value limit.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for the same price is a sure thing, there's no advantage to doing so over accepting Bob's offer. 

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I achieve my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could potentially lead to a lower price."
