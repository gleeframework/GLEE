"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is significant, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget concerns.  While $950,000 is tempting, it's a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that still allows you to get a valuable product within your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
