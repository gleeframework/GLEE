"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $9,000. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000. There's room to negotiate!"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You're getting a good deal at $8,750, which is lower than John's price and still gives Alice some profit.  There's no need to risk losing the deal by making another counteroffer."
