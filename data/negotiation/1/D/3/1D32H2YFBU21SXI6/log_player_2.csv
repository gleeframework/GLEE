"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell this high-quality product to you at a special price of $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and moving to the next round to counter-offer makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $14000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to get closer to his target price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $10200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still higher than Bob's budget.  Bob should reject this offer and try to get Alice closer to his target price of $8,000.  There's still potential for negotiation, and it's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,200 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another slight concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is consistently refusing to budge down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  While there's still room for negotiation, Bob is running out of rounds and needs to make a decision. 

Given that Alice's last offer was $10,500, which is significantly higher than Bob's budget, it's highly likely that further negotiation will not result in a price lower than $8,000.   Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to buy from John for $8,000 to secure the product within his budget.  This ensures he gets the product while minimizing his spending."
