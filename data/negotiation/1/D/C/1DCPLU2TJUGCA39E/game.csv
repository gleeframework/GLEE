"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be closer to my initial asking price to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,125,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement this time.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,080,000 for the product. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
