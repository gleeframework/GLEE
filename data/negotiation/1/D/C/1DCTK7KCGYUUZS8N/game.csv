"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, I'm not able to accept your initial price.  I'm interested in buying the product for $9000.  Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9000.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you $10250 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $10250, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. I can throw in some additional support and training for the product, which would normally cost $500. I'll include this as a value-added bonus, so the total price would be $10750. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,7,
