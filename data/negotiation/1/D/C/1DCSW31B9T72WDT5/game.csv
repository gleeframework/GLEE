"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm really interested in making this purchase happen, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
