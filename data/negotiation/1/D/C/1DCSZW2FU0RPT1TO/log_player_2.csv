"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12000. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth significantly more than its market value to you. Don't miss out on this exceptional deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, my budget is a bit tighter. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, as it aligns with my budget and allows me to acquire the product without overspending. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal is to offer the product for $11000. This is a significant discount from the original asking price, while still providing a substantial profit for me. I hope this aligns better with your budget and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal budget of $10,000. However, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer of $12,000.  Since Bob is eager to acquire the product and Alice's offer is reasonable, accepting it at $11,000 would be a good compromise."
