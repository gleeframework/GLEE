"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750000 is still above my target.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $650000. Let's make this happen.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $650000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $700000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $700000 is still above my budget. Let's try $675000 as a final compromise. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident this product is worth it to me at this price.",675000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $675000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $680000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",680000.0,Alice,7,
