Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $19,000 represents a significant markup from my minimum, but it's still within a potentially acceptable range if Bob values the product. 
* **First Refusal Offer:**  By framing the offer as a ""first chance"" opportunity, it might make Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have some reason to believe Bob might value the product at more than $15,000.  If I have no such indication, starting with a smaller markup might be more prudent."
