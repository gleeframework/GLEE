"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. Let's see if we can find common ground!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $14,000. This feels closer to a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit off. How about we settle on $14,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. I'd like to counter with $14,000 again. This feels like a reasonable price for both parties involved.",14000.0,Bob,6,
