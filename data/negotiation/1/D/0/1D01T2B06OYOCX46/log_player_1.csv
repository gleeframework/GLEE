Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $7,500 is still a bit steep for me. I could do $6,500.  Would that work for you?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer but I'm on a tight budget. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $6,750. That's the best I can do.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
