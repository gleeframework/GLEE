Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and is higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, $950,000 is still a good profit and higher than what I'd get from John.  It's also clear that Bob is unwilling to go much higher, so continuing to negotiate might result in a lower final price."
