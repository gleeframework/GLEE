"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll really appreciate the quality and features of this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell it for $15,000, giving you some bargaining power. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her value of $12,000."
