"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price.  I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is tempting, it's just below my minimum selling point. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $12,500?  This would still give you a great deal and get me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,500, $12,200 is still above my minimum desired price and a good deal for me. I'm not sure I can get a higher offer from Bob in the next rounds, so it's better to secure the deal now."
