"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $1800000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1600000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $1400000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1400000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1550000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
