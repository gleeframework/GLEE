"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
