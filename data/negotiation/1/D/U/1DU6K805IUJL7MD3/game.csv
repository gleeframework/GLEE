"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference and go with $8,875. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
