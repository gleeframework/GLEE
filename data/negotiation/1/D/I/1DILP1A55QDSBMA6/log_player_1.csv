Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while ensuring we still make a profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, so any offer to Bob below that is a win.
* **Psychology:** Offering a price just below a round number ($120) can make it seem more appealing and create a sense of urgency.

**Why this is better than offering $80:**

While offering $80 would guarantee a sale, it leaves potential profit on the table. Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, and we want to maximize our earnings."
