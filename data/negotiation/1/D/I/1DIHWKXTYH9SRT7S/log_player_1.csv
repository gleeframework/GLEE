Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 allows for some negotiation downward if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential return on investment"" to appeal to Bob's interest. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing she can sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
