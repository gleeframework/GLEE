Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you something incredibly valuable that I know you'll appreciate. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 950000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Offering it for the full amount might scare Bob off.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $800,000 gives us room to negotiate but starting too high ($999,999) is unlikely to be successful. 
* **John as a Guarantee:**  The safety net of John's offer allows for a bolder initial ask. There's less risk in aiming high with Bob.
* **The ""Special"" Angle:** The message emphasizes the value to entice Bob and justify the price. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between a price attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously while still maximizing potential profit for Alice."
