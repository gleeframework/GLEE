"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,075,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
