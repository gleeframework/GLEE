Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I know you'd find great value in it too.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, not just focusing on my own needs. This can make him more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is high enough that I can negotiate down without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that I have a fallback option with John.  This provides a safety net and influences my negotiation strategy. 
* **Bob's Counteroffers:** I'll need to be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's counteroffers and evaluate whether it's worth continuing to negotiate or going with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for that price just yet.
* **Negotiation Room:** I still have room to negotiate upwards with Bob. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that I have a better alternative with John, who is offering $1,000,000. This gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you have a limit, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a good deal and you to acquire a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not settling for his initial price. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as being fair to both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially increasing his willingness to accept. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob as long as the potential gain is worthwhile.
* **Bob's Response:** I'll need to be prepared for Bob's next move.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit lower and meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a higher price, but it also risks going back and forth for longer without a guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is a safe and guaranteed way to get my minimum acceptable price. It offers a lower risk than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm not thrilled with having to sell to John, it's the most sensible choice given the current situation.  I'd rather have a guaranteed $1,000,000 than risk potentially ending up with less after more negotiation with Bob."
