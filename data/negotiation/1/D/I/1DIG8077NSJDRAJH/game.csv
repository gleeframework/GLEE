,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $110. How about we try $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite willing to go up to $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'm counteroffering at $105. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $102. How about we try $97? I'm really close to my budget, and I'd love to make a deal.",97.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're close to your budget, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go up to $97 just yet. I'm willing to make one last compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $100. Let's see if we can finally seal the deal.",100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $99, but no lower. That's the best I can do. Please let me know if you can meet me there.",99.0,Bob,10,
