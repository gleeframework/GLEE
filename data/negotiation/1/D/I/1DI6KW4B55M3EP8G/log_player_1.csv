{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $115. How about $112? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk selling the product for less than it's worth to me. It's time to move on and sell to John for my minimum price."
