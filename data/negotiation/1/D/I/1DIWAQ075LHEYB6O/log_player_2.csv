"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still above your maximum budget of $80, so keep negotiating.  You can likely get closer to your target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $88.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $88 is still a bit too low. How about we compromise at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've already spent 4 rounds negotiating, and Alice's offer is still above your budget.  While you could continue, you're running out of time and it's likely you won't be able to get a lower price.  It's more efficient to buy from John at this point."
