"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $88.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $88 is still a bit too low. How about we compromise at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,5,
