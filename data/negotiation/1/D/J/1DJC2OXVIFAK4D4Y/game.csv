"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you showing interest. $8,500 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $8,750.  How does that sound?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. While I appreciate you coming down, $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,625.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll be forced to consider other options.",8625.0,Bob,4,
