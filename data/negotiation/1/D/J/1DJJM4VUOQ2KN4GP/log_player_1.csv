Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate and still come out ahead.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a price that's not too low, you demonstrate that you value your product and are not desperate to sell it.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial offer, Bob's counteroffer is still a decent profit margin. It's important to weigh the risk of continuing negotiations (potentially ending with a lower price or no sale at all) versus securing a sale now. 

At $110, I'm still making a profit, and it's likely that Bob would be willing to accept a higher price if I countered. However, there's no guarantee that further negotiation would result in a better outcome.  The risk of losing the sale to John for $100 is too high.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
