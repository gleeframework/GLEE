"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's within your budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($1,200,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for saving:** There's a chance to get a better deal, especially with multiple rounds available. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** The option to buy from John gives you leverage and a fallback position if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential negotiation. 
* **Establishing a negotiation range:** This counteroffer establishes a starting point for negotiations, leaving room for both parties to compromise.
* **Setting the tone:** The message expresses appreciation for Alice's offer while also clearly stating Bob's intention to get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm still confident that my initial offer was fair. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price:** While it's closer to your initial counteroffer, it's still higher than what you are willing to pay.
* **Negotiation potential:** You've already established a negotiation range, and there's still room to get a lower price with more rounds left.
* **John's offer as leverage:** You can use John's offer as a safety net, reminding Alice that you have other options if she doesn't come closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful step:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to compromise.  
* **Maintaining a negotiation range:**  This keeps the negotiation moving without immediately accepting Alice's offer.
* **Positive language:**  The message encourages Alice to continue the negotiation by highlighting your belief in a mutually agreeable outcome."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:**  While she's coming down in price, it's still above your target and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Continuing to narrow the gap:** With only a few rounds left, you need to keep pushing for a lower price.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** The threat of buying from John is still a powerful tool to influence Alice's final decision."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,340,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to reach a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,390,000.

* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only three rounds left, the time for negotiation is getting tight.
* **John's offer as a strong backup:** The threat of buying from John provides significant leverage, especially with time running out.

**Next Step:** You should send another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your desired range.  While you're getting closer, you should aim for a price that's acceptable to you and potentially try to push Alice further. Remember, you can still choose to buy from John if a deal with Alice doesn't work out."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we've both made concessions, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. My final offer is $1,360,000. This is a fair price that respects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1360000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your determination, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,400,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While she's made concessions, her final offer is still above your desired price and higher than you're willing to pay.
* **Limited rounds:**  This is the penultimate round, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.
* **John's offer provides a better alternative:**  Buying from John, while more expensive, guarantees you the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice. 

You've made a good effort to negotiate with Alice, but with time running out, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John, even at a slightly higher price."
