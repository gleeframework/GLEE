"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would still leave us both with a good deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $10,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a reasonable compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, $10,500 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something under $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $10,750 is still a little low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,875.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10875.0,Alice,7,
