""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know this product can be incredibly valuable, and I believe this offer represents a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire it."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  
* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for him to still perceive substantial value and potentially counter-offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial high price anchors the negotiation and leaves space for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he manages to haggle the price down a bit. 

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for further negotiation where we can gradually lower the price closer to $1,500,000 (our guaranteed sale price)."
