"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, Alice, but I have to stick to my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we try $825,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $787,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $825,000. How about we try $812,500? It's a small increase, but it's still a good compromise.",812500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go a little higher, but $812,500 is pushing it.  How about we settle at $800,000 even?  That's a round number we can both feel good about.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go a bit higher, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $815,000? It's still a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with it.",815000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $805,000.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John.",805000.0,Bob,10,
