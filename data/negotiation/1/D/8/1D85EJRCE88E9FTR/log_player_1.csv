{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you're interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's a good middle ground.  It's above my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate down if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $10,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $9,250? That's a good compromise, and still leaves us both with a nice margin."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your initial asking price, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly higher than what John would pay.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it."
