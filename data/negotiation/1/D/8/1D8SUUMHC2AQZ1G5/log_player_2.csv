Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your effort to negotiate and I'm willing to go a little lower.  I'm proposing $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it reflects my minimum price.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
