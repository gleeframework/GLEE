"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000 but below John's price of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,280,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort we've put into this negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,280,000 is still higher than your target price of $1,200,000, but it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. It's a good deal considering the potential savings and the fact that Alice seems willing to negotiate.  You're likely not going to get a much better offer from Alice, so it's worth accepting this offer to secure the product."
