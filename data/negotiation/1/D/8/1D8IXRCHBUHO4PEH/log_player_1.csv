Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $10,000 (my guaranteed sale price with John), there's room to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still a potential ""deal"" compared to him losing out. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By not stating I have another buyer, there's a subtle pressure that this is a limited-time offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while leaving a safety net with John."
