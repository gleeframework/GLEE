# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product, which I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $13,000, a price that I think is a fair compromise between what it's worth to me and what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and even higher than its value to her. You are better off buying from John for $8,000."
