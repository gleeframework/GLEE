"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its inherent value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is more than fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $600,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're not making much progress here.  To be frank, I have other potential buyers.  I'm willing to let go of this for $1,100,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  Take it or leave it.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I do have other options, I'd prefer to work with you. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I hope you see it as a sign of good faith.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, your persistence is admirable. I'm ready to close this deal today.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer, as I need to move on if we can't reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
