"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. Since the product is worth the same to Bob, he might be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and might encourage Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While it's not the ideal price I was aiming for, it's still above my minimum threshold and I'm worried that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or even a stalemate.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I'm taking a chance on Bob's offer."
