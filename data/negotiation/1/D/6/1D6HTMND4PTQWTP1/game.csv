"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table, along with the level of craftsmanship and the potential ROI, makes my initial offer more than justified.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
