Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer and a chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** While Bob values the product at $800,000, you have a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,000,000. This means you're not desperate to sell below John's offer.
* **Strong Stance:** Starting with your firm asking price of $1,000,000 establishes the product's value in Bob's mind.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  There's a small chance Bob might value some intangible aspect of the product enough to meet your full price. Even if he tries to negotiate, you have a strong fallback position with John.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing your profit. It doesn't leave room for negotiation, which might be a consideration if you want to maintain a positive relationship with Bob."
