"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant amount considering my budget limitations. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is appealing, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a willingness to find a compromise here, and I respect that. Let's try this – $1,750,000. This bridges the gap significantly and ensures you're getting a fair deal on a truly valuable asset.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, and I truly believe that's a fair price for both of us. If we can't come to an agreement, I'm going to have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. I'm prepared to make my final offer – $1,550,000. This reflects the product's genuine value while acknowledging your investment. I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll need to consider other options.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
