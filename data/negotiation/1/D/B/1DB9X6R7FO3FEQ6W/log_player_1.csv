``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good deal, but also leaving room to negotiate.  It's a bit above my minimum, giving me some wiggle room, and significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, which could make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is still too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a bit more. I'm going to make one final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with. Let's make this final offer: $10,500. It's a fair price that considers both our needs.  This is my last offer, so let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $10250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $10,250 is still above my minimum and represents a fair compromise.  It's better to secure a deal with Bob now rather than risk losing him entirely or having to settle for John's lower offer."
