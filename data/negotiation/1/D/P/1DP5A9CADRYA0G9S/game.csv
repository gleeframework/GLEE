"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product is $800,000. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800,000, and its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a good compromise and allows you to make a healthy profit. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits us both.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price that balances my need for profit with your desire to pay a reasonable price for the product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
