{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it's still significantly lower than the value to Bob. It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone, inviting him to negotiate. This gives me room to adjust the price if needed, while also securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value to me while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can push for a higher price, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. I'll counteroffer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still a good profit for me, and I'm confident I won't be able to get much higher. There's a risk of him walking away and me having to settle for John's offer of $800,000.  Accepting his offer secures a profitable deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
