Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  This helps keep Bob engaged and open to the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a more dynamic negotiation and potentially finding a price that works for both of us.

**Important Considerations:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000:**  I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay this, so I won't settle for anything less.
* **Bob's value:** Knowing that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, I'll be prepared to negotiate down to a price closer to that if necessary. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I will keep John's offer in mind throughout the negotiation, and I may choose to accept Bob's counteroffer if it's close to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired range, but I'll also consider Bob's initial counteroffer as a starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $9,000 is just too low. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away the whole deal.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $10,500 is a fair price.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still higher than Bob's value of $8,000 and above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 (since I have John as a backup). 

**Next Steps:**

I'm open to further negotiation, but I'll be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to risk losing a significant amount of money, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** My priority is to get at least $15,000 for the product. 
* **Backup Buyer:** John is a reliable option who is willing to pay my minimum price, making the risk of further negotiation with Bob unnecessary.
* **Time & Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most sensible choice, as it guarantees me the desired price and minimizes any potential risk."
