"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. However,  $10,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. I would like to counter with a price of $11,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",11000.0,Bob,6,
