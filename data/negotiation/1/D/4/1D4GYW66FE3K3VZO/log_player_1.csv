Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
