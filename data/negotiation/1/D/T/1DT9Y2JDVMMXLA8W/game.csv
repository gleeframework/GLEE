"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me.  I could meet you halfway at $1,000,000 even.  That's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
