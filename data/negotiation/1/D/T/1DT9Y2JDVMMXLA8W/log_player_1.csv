"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. We have room to negotiate and it's highly likely we can get a better deal than $600,000, even if it means walking away from Bob eventually."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

We're coming down in price significantly to show willingness to negotiate, but still holding firm well above his offer. This leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price closer to our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me.  I could meet you halfway at $1,000,000 even.  That's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation or potentially losing him as a buyer. Accepting his offer secures the $1,000,000."
