"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is open to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to find a middle ground.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a high starting price to maximize potential profit. However, I'm also aware of the 10-round limit and John's offer of $15,000. If the negotiation stalls, I'll be ready to switch to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** I need at least $15,000 for the product.
* **There are still 8 rounds left.** This gives me enough time to negotiate with Bob without resorting to selling to John. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range but still leave some room for negotiation. My goal is to get Bob closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to work something out!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower but Still Profitable Price:** I'm dropping the price to $11,000, which is still above my minimum of $15,000 but demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value and Fairness:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that my offer is still fair for both parties.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:** My message is positive and focuses on finding a solution, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

By counter-offering with $11,000, I'm hoping to bridge the gap between our positions while still securing a decent profit. I'll continue to negotiate strategically, keeping my minimum price in mind, and the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is still on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can continue to negotiate with Bob and see if he's willing to increase his offer further. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still significantly higher than Bob's current proposal.  This will show that I'm willing to be flexible, but also that I'm determined to get a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to find a compromise.  However, $10,000 is still too low.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to go down to $10,500.  This represents a substantial discount from my initial price and is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, dropping the price to $10,500, to show willingness to compromise. However, this price is still above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Emphasize Value and Compromise:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Encourage a Positive Response:** My message is positive and encourages Bob to consider my offer, hoping to move the negotiation forward.

**Strategy:**

I'm strategically trying to nudge Bob closer to my desired price point by showing flexibility while still maintaining a profitable margin. The 5 rounds remaining give me some room to negotiate further, but I'm ready to accept a price close to my minimum if it seems like an agreement is within reach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway at $10,250 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $10,250 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** While I only have 4 rounds remaining,  I'm not desperate to sell at this price. There's still potential for negotiation to get closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer is a Safeguard:** I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a profitable margin.  My goal is to push Bob closer to my minimum price while keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,250.  While I'm closer to finding common ground, it's still a bit below my target. To make this work for both of us, I'm proposing a price of $10,400.  This would give you a great deal on a valuable product, and allow me to meet my minimum.  Let's finalize this and call it a day!"", ""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm raising the price slightly to $10,400. This shows my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit above my minimum.

* **Fairness for Both:** I'm reminding Bob that this price is fair for both of us,  giving him a good deal while ensuring I meet my minimum.

I'm aiming to close the deal in this round. By making a small increase, I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to my desired price.  I'm emphasizing finality to make this offer more appealing and push him towards a decision.  However, I'm prepared to move to John if this offer is rejected."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $10,300 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Time:**  With only two rounds left, time is getting tight. However, I'm not desperate to sell at a price that's far below my minimum.
* **John's Offer is a Secure Option:**  If negotiations with Bob don't succeed, I can still sell to John for $15,000, which guarantees a significant profit.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still within a range that allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin.  I'm aiming to see if Bob is truly committed to reaching an agreement. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer in the final round."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,300 is still a bit too low for me.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a small amount to $10,350. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a ""fair compromise"" that will allow both of us to be happy. 
* **Urgency:** The message subtly implies that this could be my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

With only one round left, I'm making a final attempt to close the deal with Bob.  This is a small increase to push him towards my minimum price, but if he rejects this, I'll likely accept John's offer in the final round."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered your latest offer and am willing to agree on a final price of $10,325 for the product.

```

**Reasoning:**
