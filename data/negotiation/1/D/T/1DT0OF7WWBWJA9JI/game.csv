"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's try to work something out!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your ongoing efforts to find a compromise.  However, $10,000 is still too low.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to go down to $10,500.
