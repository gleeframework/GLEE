Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000** is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $12,000, giving me a profit.
* It's also a price that might be attractive to Bob, especially if he values the product higher than $15,000.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while minimizing risk."
