"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product and believe it could be useful to me. However, my budget is limited and I am not able to pay $20,000. Could you consider lowering the price to $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $14,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, $17,000 is still beyond my current budget. I would like to propose $15,000 as a compromise.",15000.0,Bob,4,
