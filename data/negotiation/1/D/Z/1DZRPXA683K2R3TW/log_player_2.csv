"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is very close to my maximum budget.  I'm not sure if the product is worth that much to me yet, so I'd like to see if I can get a better price.  By rejecting the offer, I can start negotiating and potentially get it for less."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm very interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, but it's still a bit high for my comfort level.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also aware of the option to buy from John, which gives me some leverage in this negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $870000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $870,000, which is only $20,000 above my last counteroffer.  At this point, it's getting closer to my desired price range, and I'm willing to close the deal.  It's also significantly cheaper than buying from John."
