Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While $950,000 is getting closer to a tempting offer, I'm still willing to hold out for a better price from Bob as I'm aiming for a minimum of $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

Bob is not moving towards my desired price point. It's becoming clear that we are unlikely to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. I'd rather cut my losses now and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
