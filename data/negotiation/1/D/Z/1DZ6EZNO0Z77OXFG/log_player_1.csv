Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize the deal being ""great for both of us"" to create a positive frame and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I end with an open-ended question to invite Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially counter-offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider:
    * **Is it close to my minimum acceptable price?**  If yes, I might accept.
    * **Is it too low?**  If yes, I'll counter-offer again, potentially lowering my price slightly.
    * **How valuable is the deal?** If I feel the potential for a good deal is low, I may choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000 for this product. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet this price range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  $900,000 is still below my minimum of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer indicates a willingness to negotiate within a specific range. I can leverage this and counter-offer with a higher price.
* **Selling to John is the safer option:** While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of ending up with a lower sale. However, I'm willing to explore a counter-offer to potentially get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter-offer Bob with a price higher than $900,000 but lower than $1,200,000. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,000,000. 
* I will carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer and assess the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price.
* If negotiations with Bob stall, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000 to secure the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you letting me know your price range. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** My counteroffer is $50,000 higher than Bob's offer, which is a significant step towards my desired price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I emphasize ""finding a price that works better for both of us"" to maintain a collaborative tone.
* **Highlight the value for Bob:**  I mention that $950,000 ""still allows you to make a good deal"" to appeal to Bob's interests and potentially encourage acceptance.
* **Open to further discussion:** I end with a question to keep the conversation going and assess Bob's potential for a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price that's closer to my target. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll likely counter-offer again, potentially lowering my price slightly.
* If negotiations stall, I'll be prepared to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my financial situation, I am unable to go beyond $880,000 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price:** $880,000 is far below my minimum of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiations are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price:** Bob's counteroffer indicates a significant difference in our perceived value of the product. It's unlikely that further negotiations will bridge the gap.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 eliminates the risk of a low sale and ensures I receive my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll inform Bob that I'm unable to accept his offer due to its significantly lower price than my minimum acceptable value.
* I'll proceed to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, securing the deal and ensuring my desired profit."
