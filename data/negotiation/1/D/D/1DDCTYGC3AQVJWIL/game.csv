,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $165, which is a great deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $140? It's a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer you a price of $155, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
