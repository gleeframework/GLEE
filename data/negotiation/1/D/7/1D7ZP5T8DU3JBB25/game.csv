"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a solution.  However, $10250 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $10750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to be satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10750. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $10500. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
