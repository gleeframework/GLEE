"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're confident it will meet your needs. For this round, I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know if this works for you!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. For this round, I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $120. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it strikes a fair balance between our positions.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $115. Can we meet at this price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I propose to sell the product to you for $117. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair solution for both of us.",117.0,Alice,5,
