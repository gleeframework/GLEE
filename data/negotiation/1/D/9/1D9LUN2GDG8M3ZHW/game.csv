"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your desired value and my budget. Let's work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,350,000 is my final offer.  This price still leaves room for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
