Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly tone in the message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've explicitly stated that I'm open to negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"". This avoids making the offer feel rigid and encourages Bob to counter if he's interested. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's close to my minimum, I might accept. If it's too low, I'll counter again, potentially lowering my price slightly.
* If the negotiation drags on or I feel like I'm not getting a fair price, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's reasonably close to my initial asking price of $100.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to quickly close the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation.

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer represents a good compromise that balances maximizing my profit with minimizing the risk of losing the sale.**"
