"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,200,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, and offering $850,000 is a significant step towards his goal. This price is still above Alice's minimum selling point, but it leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price from Alice. There's still a chance she might come down further, as she's already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to strike a balance between getting the best possible price and ensuring a successful negotiation. $875,000 is a compromise, offering a slightly higher price than his previous counteroffer but still below Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates Bob's seriousness in buying the product while also pushing for a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to her initial asking price. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially returning to her previous offer is high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
