"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that could potentially bring your business a significant profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a great price considering the product's true worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,200,000. There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your ideal price from John."
