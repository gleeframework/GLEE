"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from its true value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price that is close to my value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the discount Bob is getting, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm not starting at my absolute maximum price, anticipating that Bob will likely counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's room for compromise and counter-offers, so I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage and shows I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great value for you, and it's closer to a point where we can both be happy with the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not going too low, but I'm also not staying at my initial offer.  This shows flexibility without immediately accepting Bob's low price.
* **Maintaining a reasonable price:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose too much.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm focusing on the positive aspects of the deal for Bob, emphasizing the ""great value"" he's getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **There's still time to negotiate:**  We have 6 rounds remaining, and I can still counter-offer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under extreme pressure to accept Bob's low offer.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,400,000, but I'm still not quite there yet. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):**  I'm coming down to a point that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting my concession:**  I'm emphasizing the fact that I'm compromising to make the deal work, hoping to make Bob feel obligated to reciprocate.
* **Focusing on value:**  I'm reminding Bob about the value he'll get for the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still room for a slight counter-offer, so I'm not locking myself into a deal I'm not comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **We're getting closer:**  While his offer is still too low, it's getting closer to my desired price.  It's likely he's willing to go a little higher.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000, so I'm not in a desperate position to accept Bob's offer.

I'm going to reject his offer and try to get him to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $1,525,000, showing flexibility without going below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm stressing the ""fairness"" of the price, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leaving room:**  I'm still leaving room for a small counter-offer from Bob, as we're nearing the end of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,525,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,475,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're nearing the end:** We only have 2 rounds left, and it's unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  I've been trying to get a higher price from Bob, but I'm not confident he'll come up to my minimum.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed sale, and it meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Instead of risking another round of negotiation with Bob that might not result in a higher offer, it's more efficient to secure the deal with John.

I'm going to sell to John."
