"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a great value for you, and it's closer to a point where we can both be happy with the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen.
