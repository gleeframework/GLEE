Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than what Bob values the product at ($80), but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're not selling below your minimum value of $120.
* **It's a strong opening:**  This offer shows you're confident in the value of your product, but also open to negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a better price than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $90 is still a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and meet at $95?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer is a good next step:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above my minimum:** $95 is still higher than my minimum value of $120, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **It's a fair offer:**  It splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, giving Bob a chance to come closer to my price without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $92 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'm going to drop my price to $93.  This is a very fair offer, and I'm confident you'll find it agreeable.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 93}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good final attempt:

* **It's a small concession:**  It's a minimal drop from my previous offer, showing I'm still confident in the value of the product.
* **It's above my minimum:** $93 is still above my minimum value of $120, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **It's a strong closing offer:** It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also giving Bob a fair price."
