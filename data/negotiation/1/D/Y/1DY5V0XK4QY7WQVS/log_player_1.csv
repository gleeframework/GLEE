Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation but Alice needs to stay above that number.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy it for $15,000 gives Alice leverage.

**The offer:** By starting high ($14,999), Alice leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price very close to her backup offer. The message also emphasizes ""value,"" subtly suggesting Bob might be getting a good deal."
