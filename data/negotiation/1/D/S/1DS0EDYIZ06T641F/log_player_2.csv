"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's initial offer is above your budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit though, how about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down in price, you're still aiming for a price closer to $100. It's worth negotiating a bit further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $107?"",
""product_price"": 107
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  How about $110?  That's a good compromise, and it's still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably, and $110 is a good price for the product. It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a much better price without risking losing the deal altogether."
