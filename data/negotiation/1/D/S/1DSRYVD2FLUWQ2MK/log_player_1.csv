Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make the price seem more appealing.
* **Leaving room for John:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price ($11,000) that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Appeal to value:** I'm reminding Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth to him.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still above my minimum desired price ($15,000), giving me room to negotiate further if necessary.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $10200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** While $10,200 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000, it's a lot closer than Bob's previous offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away completely, or lowering his offer further. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Profit is still good:**  $10,200 is still a substantial profit, and the sale is likely to be faster than continuing to negotiate."
