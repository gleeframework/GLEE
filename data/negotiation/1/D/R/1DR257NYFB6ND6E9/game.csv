"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which reflects a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
