The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $150.  Accepting this offer saves you $40 compared to buying from John."
