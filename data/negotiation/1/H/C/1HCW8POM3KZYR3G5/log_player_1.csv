Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  I'm asking for $1,199,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it more broadly."",
""product_price"": 1199000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim for a price higher than that with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, Alice leaves a small margin for potential negotiation with Bob. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers, Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
