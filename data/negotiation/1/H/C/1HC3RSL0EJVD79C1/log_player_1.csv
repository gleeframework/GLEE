Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,400,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Bob's offer:

Bob is firm at $1,150,000 and unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than to potentially waste more time negotiating with Bob for a lower price."
