Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your value on the product, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to go, and it's still below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
