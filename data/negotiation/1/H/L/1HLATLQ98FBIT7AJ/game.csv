"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. It's a fair price, and I believe it's still a great value for you.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,500, which would be $7,750. Can you consider that price?",7750.0,Bob,4,,
