"Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $80, which is fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $80, but I need to make a bit more than that.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a significant compromise from my original offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal before time runs out.",90.0,Alice,5,
