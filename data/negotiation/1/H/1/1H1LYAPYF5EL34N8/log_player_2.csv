"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He is looking to pay no more than $80, and Alice's offer is above that.  There's no reason to accept it when he has another option available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still get the product for cheaper from John. There's no need to accept Alice's offer when he has a better alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $80, which is fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $80, but I need to make a bit more than that.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a significant compromise from my original offer.  Let's see if we can reach a deal before time runs out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice is lowering her price, it's still above Bob's target of $80. Since he can get the product for his target price from John, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
