"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still offers you significant value while being closer to my desired range. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a final price of $1,100,000.  This price provides you with a great deal and is within a range I'm comfortable with. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
