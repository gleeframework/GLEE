{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $175, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, while also highlighting the product's value to Bob. This can help build a positive rapport and increase the chance of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too low to consider. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's still a decent deal for Bob since he values the product at $100. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and being polite, but firm on my minimum price. I'm also emphasizing the value he's getting at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $150, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I've already come down to my minimum price. To avoid further negotiation and secure a better price, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $150."
