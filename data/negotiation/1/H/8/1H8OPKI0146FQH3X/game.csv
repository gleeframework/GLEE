"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $11,500 for it.  What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little though. How about $12,500?  That's a fair price for this amazing product. ",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I can manage right now. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  I'm really keen on this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
