{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond the guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,000,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions the product as valuable while still being appealing to Bob, given his potential profit margin."
