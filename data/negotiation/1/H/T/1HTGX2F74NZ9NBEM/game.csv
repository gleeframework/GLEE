"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and what I know it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
