"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get an exclusive product at a discount. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I have to consider the value it brings to the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that's fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to invest in the product, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go and still ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
