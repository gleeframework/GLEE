"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less than $12,000, and he wants to save as much money as possible.  Going to the next round allows him to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  $12,000 is a bit high for me, but I'm definitely interested in the product. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He is still aiming to get the product for less than $11,500.  He has several rounds left and can continue to negotiate.  Buying from John at this point is not a good option since it's more expensive than Alice's latest offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,500, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $11250. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He is getting the product for a price that is well within his budget and significantly lower than buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer, and he may end up buying from John at a higher price.  It's a good deal, and it's time to close the deal."
