"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You'll save the most money by going with John."
