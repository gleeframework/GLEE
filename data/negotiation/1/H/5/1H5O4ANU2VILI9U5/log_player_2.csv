"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be extremely beneficial to your business.  I'm confident that it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that is fair to both of us.  My asking price is $1,200,000. This price represents a significant discount from its true value, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a compelling opportunity.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John wants $1,500,000. 
* **You can still save money:** Even at $1,200,000, you are getting the product for significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
