Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm offering a price slightly lower than what I know it's worth to Bob, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This allows for some negotiation space while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and is a reasonable compromise. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal without risking losing him as a buyer and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
