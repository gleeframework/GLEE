"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum desired price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $90 is a good price, as it's above my minimum and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a chance I could get a little more, but the risk of losing the deal entirely isn't worth it."
