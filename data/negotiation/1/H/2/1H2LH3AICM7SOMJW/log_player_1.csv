Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell for less than $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. Offering the product at $10,000 gives Bob a $2,000 incentive to buy (his valuation minus the offer price) while securing a $2,000 profit for Alice (offer price minus her minimum).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a good profit margin and avoiding a situation where Bob rejects the offer, forcing Alice to sell to John at her minimum acceptable price."
