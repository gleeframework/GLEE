"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I believe you'll be very interested in. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm looking for at least $12,000.

Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation. I should counter-offer with a much lower price to see how much she's willing to come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is more to your liking.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off.  I'll counteroffer to try and split the difference again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,500? It's a compromise that should be more in line with what I'm looking for.

Alice is barely budging now. I'll make one last attempt to get closer to $10,000. If she rejects it, it's probably time to walk away and buy from John."
