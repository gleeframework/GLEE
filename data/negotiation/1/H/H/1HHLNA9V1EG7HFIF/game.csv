"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I believe you'll be very interested in. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm looking for at least $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $11,500? It's a compromise that should be more in line with what I'm looking for.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I can't go any higher than $10,000.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
