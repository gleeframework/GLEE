"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant long-term value, which is why I'm proposing $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has significant long-term value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,700,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,550,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
