"Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,400,000 at this time.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on that price, I'll purchase the product immediately. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,600,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1,580,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1580000.0,Alice,5,
