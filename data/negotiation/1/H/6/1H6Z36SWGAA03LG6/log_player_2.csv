"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum price point. You can get the same product from John for the same price. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the optimal strategy, as it doesn't change the price but potentially allows for negotiation with John in the future."
