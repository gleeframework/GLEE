"I understand that $1250000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1280000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
