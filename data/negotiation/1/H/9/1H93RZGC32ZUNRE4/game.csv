"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $775000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to get a good deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your new counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering the product to you for $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",800000.0,Alice,5,
