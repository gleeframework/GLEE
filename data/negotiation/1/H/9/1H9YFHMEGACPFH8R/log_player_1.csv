"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message might make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Opportunity:**  A $1 million price point leaves some room for both of us to compromise.  

**Important Note:** I'm not revealing my minimum price to Bob. This gives me more leverage throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's room for both of us to compromise further.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to stay in control and potentially secure a higher price in the next round.
* **Not selling to John yet:**  I haven't reached my desired price with Bob, but there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $950,000. It's a very valuable product, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let's keep talking, and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is still friendly, encouraging continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Move:**  This counteroffer allows me to potentially close the deal in this round, or continue the negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $920,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is ticking:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While I'd like to push for a higher price, the potential of losing the deal to John outweighs the benefit of trying to squeeze out a few more dollars. 

It's important to weigh the risk of losing the deal against the potential reward of continuing to negotiate. In this case, accepting the offer is the most strategic move."
