"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price from Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and still within his budget. This is a bold move, but it signals Bob's serious intent to negotiate and potentially secure a good deal. It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but it's a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what Bob can get from John. It's likely that further negotiation will not yield a better result.  It's not worth the risk of potentially failing to get a deal with Alice and having to buy from John at the higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this situation."
