"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob and make him feel valued.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit, but I'm not going to give it away at my minimum price right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest, suggesting there's room for negotiation.
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:**  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price, as I believe I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with rationale:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, acknowledging Bob's offer while also highlighting the value of the product.
* **Meeting halfway:** $160 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Can you do $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $140 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **I'm willing to risk a few more rounds:** I'm still confident I can get a better price, and John's offer is a safety net if needed. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob is showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, so there's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! $140 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $145? I'm willing to meet you halfway again. "", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:**  I'm staying engaged with Bob and showing flexibility. 
* **Small compromise:** $145 is a small step closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to be reasonable.
* **Focusing on a mutual solution:**  I'm emphasizing the need to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to go up to $142. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $142 is only $8 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only four rounds left, there's a high chance I won't be able to get a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a secure option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  the risk of ending up with a lower price or running out of rounds is too high. Selling to John provides a reliable and secure outcome."
