"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that my minimum is $12,000. Bob values the product at $10,000, so this offer is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair compromise, as it's closer to his offer and higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is my minimum, but John is also offering the same amount. I could risk another round of negotiation, but there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer. It's also possible that Bob might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with no deal at all. 

Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $12,000.  It's a safe bet, and it guarantees me my minimum profit."
