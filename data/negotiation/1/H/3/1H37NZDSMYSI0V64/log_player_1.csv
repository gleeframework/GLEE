{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal for a product that's worth $15,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still below my minimum. This allows for some negotiation room.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the value of the product to me, suggesting that Bob is getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  I am aware of John's offer of $15,000, but I'm starting with Bob because I have a chance to potentially get closer to my minimum with a good negotiation.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** I'm prepared for Bob to counter-offer. I will need to carefully assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-offer of my own.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** My goal is to maximize my profit. I will need to balance my desire to get as close to $15,000 as possible with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I want to earn. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm raising my price to $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Reiterating Value:** I am reminding Bob of the product's value, making it clear that he is still getting a good price.
* **Open to Agreement:** I end with an open-ended statement, showing my willingness to continue the negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,200 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a final counteroffer.  At this point, I need to decide if the potential loss of $4,800 (from John's offer) is worth continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $10,500. This is my best price.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, let's close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm offering a price of $10,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still reasonably close to my minimum.
* **Strong Language:** I'm using assertive language like ""final concession"" and ""moving on to other buyers"" to emphasize the limited negotiation room remaining. 
* **Decision Pressure:** I'm putting the pressure on Bob to decide.  He needs to determine if this price works for him or if he's willing to risk losing the product.

**Important Note:**  At this point, I'm balancing two factors:

* **Profit:**  I'm still losing $4,500 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk:** If I reject Bob's final offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and might not be able to find another buyer at a comparable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call, but with Bob's last offer at $9,800, I'm too close to my minimum. I've already made several concessions and am at a point where I'm losing a significant amount of money compared to John's offer. 

While I could continue negotiating, the chances of Bob going any higher are slim.  It's better to cut my losses and move on to John, who is willing to pay a price closer to my minimum and ensures a more profitable deal."
