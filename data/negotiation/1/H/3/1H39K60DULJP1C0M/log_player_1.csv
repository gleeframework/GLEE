"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Bob's offer is higher than your minimum price, but still significantly lower than his perceived value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I'd like to propose $86 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While we could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly trying to be reasonable and meet closer to the middle ground. Accepting $86 is a solid profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
