"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
