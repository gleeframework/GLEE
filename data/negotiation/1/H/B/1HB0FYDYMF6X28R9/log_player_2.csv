"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is lower than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and sending another counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This would be a good middle ground, and we could both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $900,000 is still below what I can accept.  To be frank, I have another offer for the full asking price, but I'd prefer to work with you. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but that's my final offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $975,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $800,000.  Alice has made it clear this is her final offer.  In this situation, it's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid risking further negotiations that might not lead to a better price."
