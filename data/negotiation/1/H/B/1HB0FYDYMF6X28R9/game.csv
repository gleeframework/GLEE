"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant value beyond that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000. This would be a good middle ground, and we could both walk away satisfied.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $900,000 is still below what I can accept.  To be frank, I have another offer for the full asking price, but I'd prefer to work with you. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but that's my final offer. ",975000.0,Alice,5,
