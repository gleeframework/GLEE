"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from it. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you'll get from selling it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
