"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant profit margin while still allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's value to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $975,000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
