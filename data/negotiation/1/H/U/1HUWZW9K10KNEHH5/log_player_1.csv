I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This allows room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
