"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
