"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1800000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1600000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1450000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of this product.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. I can see that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer you a price of $1550000. This is a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still a little above my limit.  I'm willing to go to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum.  This would allow us to close the deal and avoid further negotiations.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
