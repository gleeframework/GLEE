"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us a lot of room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum goal of $1,500,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fair price and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum goal, it's still significantly less than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. I'm still above my minimum goal, but I'm showing Bob that I'm flexible and willing to work with him. This should hopefully make him reconsider his offer and come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum goal. With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time. But, I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob. I'm still hoping to get closer to my $1,500,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum goal, but time is running out. I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000, which is still a significant profit for me. With only 3 rounds left, I need to push for a deal with Bob before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum goal, but I'm still not happy with the price. With only two rounds left, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob and try to get him to come closer to my asking price.  I have to try and get a better deal before I lose out on a potentially better offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm making a final push to get closer to my goal. This offer is still above my minimum, but it's the lowest I'm willing to go. With only one round left, I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and accepts my offer."
