Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have a strong position. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Scarcity tactic:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value, the language implies it's significant by using terms like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential.""

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering your fallback option of John."
