"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially save more money by negotiating further. You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and you have a backup option with John at that price. There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low. Let's split the difference.  $1,025,000 is a fair price, considering the value this product provides for you.  Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise.  You can save $75,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John for the full $1,000,000 outweighs the potential for an even lower price."
