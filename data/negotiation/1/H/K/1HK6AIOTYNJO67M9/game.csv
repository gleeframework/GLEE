"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm, but I believe we can find a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still reflects the value of the product for you.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we meet at $10,500?  This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this product to be a valuable investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,5,
