Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional item that has been meticulously designed to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. Given its unique features and benefits, we believe it's worth more than $12000. Considering this, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire it for $15000. I hope you find this offer attractive and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if a better price can be negotiated before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's quality. However, $15,000 is beyond my budget.
