"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Would you be willing to accept this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $10250, which is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay more than $9500. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
