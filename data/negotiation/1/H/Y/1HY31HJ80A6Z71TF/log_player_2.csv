"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its high value to you at $15,000, I propose we strike a deal that respects both our interests. Would you consider purchasing it for $12,000? This offer allows us to share the value while ensuring you receive a product that meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than her own valuation of $8,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price, potentially pushing her closer to her own valuation."
