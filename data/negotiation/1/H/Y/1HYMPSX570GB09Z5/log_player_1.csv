I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $150."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I have more rounds left and John is a guaranteed sale at $150."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $140 is still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum and the negotiation is getting close to the end. With only four rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to reject offers, especially with John being a guaranteed sale at $150."
