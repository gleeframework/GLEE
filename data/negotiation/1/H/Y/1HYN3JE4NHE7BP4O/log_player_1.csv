"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $115 leaves room for me to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, but still ensures I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:** $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Strategic Consideration:** While John is a guaranteed $120, I'm not desperate. There are still 8 rounds to potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The offer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Still Profitable:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $108 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:** $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds and have a good chance of reaching a better deal with Bob.
* **Strategic Consideration:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still hoping to maximize my profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $109.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Signaling this as my final offer adds pressure and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Demonstrates a willingness to compromise and meet halfway.
* **Profitable:**  $109 still exceeds my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profit.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to start pushing towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $106 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer significantly is diminishing.
* **Value Threshold:**  $106 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further negotiation risk.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher offer in the remaining rounds."
