"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the conversation!  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 to start.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,750,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $1,750,000 is still outside what I'm looking to spend. Could we meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're making progress. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I can justify.  How about we split the difference on our last offers and call it $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
