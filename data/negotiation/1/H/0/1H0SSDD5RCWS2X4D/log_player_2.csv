```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your limit. You have the option of buying from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's worth trying to push Alice lower with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value I'm placing on this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still $50,000 over your budget.  Since you have a guaranteed option with John, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice one more time to see if you can get the price down to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite at my budget limit but willing to go up to $950,000. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth further."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $25,000 above your budget.  You have two rounds left, but with John's offer being a guaranteed $1,000,000, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down to your desired price, and you could end up paying more than you want.  It's best to take the safe option and buy from John."
