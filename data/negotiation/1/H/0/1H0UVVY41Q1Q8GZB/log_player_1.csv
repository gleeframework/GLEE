Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's fair to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal price point but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than $80, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $110. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? It's still a good price for me, and I think it's closer to a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for $100, $95 is still a decent profit and a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $80, and I don't think I'll get a better offer from Bob at this point."
