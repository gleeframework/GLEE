"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12000 is too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to $14000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $14,000 is still above his target price of $12,000.
*  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.  
*  While he could buy from John for $12,000, there's still a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since she's already lowered her price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 13000}
