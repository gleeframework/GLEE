,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling the product. However, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. However, $14,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering we're both looking to make a deal.  I hope we can find common ground.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $14,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $14,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm ready to pay $13,750 for the product, which is a small step towards meeting your last offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, which is just $50 above your last offer. Let's see if we can make it work.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still hoping we can reach a deal. I can offer $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits us both. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already offered you $14,250, and you've countered with $14,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,250. I'm starting to think it's time for us to part ways. I'm willing to make one final offer: $14,250 for the product, and that's my final price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options.",14250.0,Alice,9,
