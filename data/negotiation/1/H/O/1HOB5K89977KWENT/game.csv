,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. While $6,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $9,000? This gives us both a good deal. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $7,500 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a bit higher to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,000?  That seems fair for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
