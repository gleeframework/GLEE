Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** My message highlights that the product is valuable to Bob. This could make him more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking ""What do you think?"". This allows Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Price:**  $90 is a good price for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and still leaves a decent profit margin.
* **Avoid Potential Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer, there's a risk that he'll reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to sell to John at $80. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation could take time, and I might end up getting a lower price or even losing the deal altogether.  

Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic option in this situation."
