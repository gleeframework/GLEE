"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for him. He will try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target, he can still try to push for a lower price. He's still willing to negotiate and sees room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal price, but he's still not comfortable with $10,000. He has several rounds left and believes he can still negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached a point where he's unlikely to get much lower than $10,250 from Alice, given her repeated insistence on that price point.  With only a few rounds left, it's more advantageous for him to secure the product from John at a significantly lower price of $8,000.  While he may be able to negotiate a slight decrease from Alice in the next round, the risk of not getting the product at all and having to start the entire negotiation process again with someone else is too high.  He's better off taking the guaranteed deal with John."
