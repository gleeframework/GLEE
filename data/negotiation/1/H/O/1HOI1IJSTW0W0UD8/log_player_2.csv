"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $20000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  Thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18000, which reflects the value and uniqueness of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his budget and what he can get from John.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. It's fair considering the product's value to me and the price I can get elsewhere. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I have other offers on the table.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget than before, it's still above his desired price.  He's already stated that he's willing to pay $12,000, and there's no need to rush into a decision.  There are still rounds left, and he can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm only able to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price given the product's value to me and the price I can get elsewhere. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
