"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $100. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If negotiations fail, you have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.**  While it's closer to your target, you can likely still get a better price.
* **You're making progress.** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. 
* **There's no urgency to accept.** You have several rounds left to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for being flexible. I really appreciate it.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $90, as I think that's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $90, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $95 and $90. How about we try $92.50? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target price.** You're only paying $2.50 more than your initial counteroffer. 
* **You're making progress.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has moved closer to your desired price.
* **There's a risk of going too far.**  If you reject this offer, you might not get a better price, and you're getting closer to having to buy from John at a higher cost.
* **Time is a factor.** You've already spent several rounds and have limited time before needing to buy from John.  Accepting this offer gets you the product at a decent price without risking too much time."
