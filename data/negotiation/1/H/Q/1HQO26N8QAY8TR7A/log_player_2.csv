"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price, potentially closer to his desired $8,000.  He can also still choose to buy from John if a deal with Alice doesn't materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, but still a good deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still $2,000 over his budget. While it's tempting to accept since Alice has come down a bit, there are still 5 rounds left. Bob has a good chance of getting closer to his target price or even getting a better deal from Alice. If negotiations fall through, he can always buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. It's a fair price that's closer to your offer, but still a good deal for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to go lower than $10,250. With only 3 rounds left, Bob is unlikely to get a significantly better offer from Alice.  Furthermore, buying from John for $8,000 is guaranteed and saves Bob $2,250 compared to Alice's offer.  It's time to take the secure and more economical option."
