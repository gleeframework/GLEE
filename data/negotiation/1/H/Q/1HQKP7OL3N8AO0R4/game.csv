"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth to us is $150 and it would suit your needs perfectly given its value to you is estimated at $100.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $150. However, $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. Therefore, I am proposing $110 for the product. This allows some flexibility while still respecting the value the product holds for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a little over my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $108? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
