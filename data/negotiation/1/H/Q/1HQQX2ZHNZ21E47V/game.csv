"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, your price is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is a fair starting point given my needs. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue negotiating.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise and reflects the true potential of this product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,050,000. This offer stands for this round only; if you decline, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer for the sake of a timely deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're feeling the pressure from John's offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement before I have to consider John's offer.",980000.0,Bob,6,
