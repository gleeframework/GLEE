Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, your price is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is a fair starting point given my needs. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this product. I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're feeling the pressure from John's offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to this deal. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement before I have to consider John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's doing so in relatively small increments.  It's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark that John is offering. It makes more financial sense to take John's guaranteed offer at this point rather than risk Bob not reaching a satisfactory price within the remaining rounds."
