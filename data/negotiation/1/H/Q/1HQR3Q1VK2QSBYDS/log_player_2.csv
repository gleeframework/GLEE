"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, exceeding $1200000 to me. I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for you as well. I'm prepared to sell it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects the product's intrinsic worth, while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1200000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. Even though she claims the product is worth more to her, you're not obligated to pay her perceived value. You can safely reject her offer and buy the same product from John for a much lower price."
