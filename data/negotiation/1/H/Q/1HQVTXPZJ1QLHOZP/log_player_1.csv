Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you consider that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to make a deal, $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,300,000?  I think this would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, $1,300,000 is a good compromise and closer to my minimum.  It's better to make the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer."
