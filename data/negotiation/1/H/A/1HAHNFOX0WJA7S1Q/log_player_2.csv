"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though you're trying to save as much money as possible, Alice's offer of $12,000 is still $3,000 less than John's offer.
* **The product is worth $15,000 to you:** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so accepting Alice's offer still gets you a product you want at a lower price."
