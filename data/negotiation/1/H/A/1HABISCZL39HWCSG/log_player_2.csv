"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us more room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Target in Mind:**  Our goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to our $10,000 walk-away point. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter back, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Value:** While Alice moved closer to our initial counteroffer, $8,200 is still above her value ($8,000) and much closer to John's offer ($10,000).
* **Negotiating Power:**  We still have rounds left to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might not budge much further, but the potential savings from negotiating further outweigh the risk of losing the deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $7,600? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:**  We are moving closer to Alice's price point, but in smaller increments. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** $7,600 is a price that is potentially beneficial for both parties. It's below Alice's initial offer but still above her value, giving her an incentive to accept.
* **Time Consideration:** As we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation,  proposing a reasonable price increases the chances of closing the deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $7,600. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice has now met her own value for the product. This is a strong indication she's unlikely to go any lower. 
* **Final Offer:**  Her statement ""This is my final offer"" suggests she's serious about walking away if we reject.
* **Significant Savings:** Accepting this offer still provides us with a $2,000 savings compared to John's price.

While we might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's $10,000 price outweighs the potential for minor additional savings."
