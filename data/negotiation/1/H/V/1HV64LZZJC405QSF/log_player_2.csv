# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
