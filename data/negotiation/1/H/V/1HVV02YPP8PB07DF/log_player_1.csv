"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my ideal value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and increase the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make him feel the price is justified. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to $15,000 as possible while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If the negotiations stall, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $10,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my target price and the product's value to him. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe there is still room to negotiate a more favorable price. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground. I'll be prepared to adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still gives you a significant value, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to make the price seem more attractive. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to continue the discussion.

**Strategy:**

By offering a middle ground, I'm aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, there is still room for improvement.
* **Avoid Settling Too Early:** I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my target value, especially since I have several rounds remaining.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to leverage the fact that he values the product at $15,000.

**Strategy:**

I will counter with a price closer to $12,000, hoping to find a compromise. I will also be mindful of the remaining rounds and be prepared to make a decision if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,000? That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, highlighting the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I'm continuing to use a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

By offering a middle ground and emphasizing the benefits of the deal, I'm hoping to convince Bob to accept my offer. If he rejects, I'll have to consider whether to make further concessions or take the offer from John."

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I believe I can still get a slightly higher price. 
* **Negotiations Progressing:**  The fact that Bob continues to counter means he's still interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I have a few more rounds left, which gives me leverage to push for a better deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price just above Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and we're almost there!  How about we split the difference one more time and settle at $11,875?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise, aiming for a price that is just a small step above Bob's last offer.
* **Highlighting Agreement:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a fair deal for both of us, creating a sense of mutual satisfaction.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing the limited number of rounds remaining, hinting that this might be our last chance to agree.
