"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, we're extending this opportunity to you at an introductory price of $95. We hope you find this offer compelling and look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $95 is still a bit too high."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $70?"",

This counter-offer attempts to anchor the price closer to my budget. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
