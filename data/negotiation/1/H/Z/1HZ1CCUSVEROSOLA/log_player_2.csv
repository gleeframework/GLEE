"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to understand Alice's lower bound and leaves space to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met us halfway, the price is still above her value of $8,000. This indicates there might be more room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the option to buy from John for $10,000, which gives us leverage. 

We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to a price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,000? That feels like a fair price to me."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing Alice's Bottom Line:** We're proposing a price that's exactly Alice's value for the product. This will reveal if she's willing to sell at that price or if we need to negotiate further.
* **Direct & Clear:** We're stating our desired price directly to avoid any ambiguity.
* **Compromise:** While we started lower, this counteroffer demonstrates willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's asking price."
