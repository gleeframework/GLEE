"Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $75 is below your maximum price of $80 and saves you $5. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the next round of negotiations."
