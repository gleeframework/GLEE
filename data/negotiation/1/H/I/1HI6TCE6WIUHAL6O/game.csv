"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000.

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $13000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14500. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13500, Bob, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit.

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I've already made several concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $13250, which would be $13625. I'm hoping this is a price you can live with.",13625.0,Alice,9,
