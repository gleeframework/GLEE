**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $11,000 and has indicated a willingness to walk away. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round, there's a real risk of him walking away and me ending up with John's offer of $10,000. Accepting $11,000 now secures a profit and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
