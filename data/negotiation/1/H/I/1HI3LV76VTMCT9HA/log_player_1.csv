This offer starts at a price point that's fair for both of us, giving you a good profit while still giving Bob room to negotiate.  It also sets a friendly tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9500 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within our respective comfort zones. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price to see if he's willing to budge."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again and am able to offer $9600 for the product. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's likely he won't budge much further. It's better to secure this deal than risk going back and forth with him further, potentially lowering the price or ending up selling to John for less."
