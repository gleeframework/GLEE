Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It's better to accept Bob's offer.  While a higher price would be ideal,  $850,000 is still a good deal and secures the sale.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome, and the risk of rejection or a lengthy process means potentially losing the sale to John for a lower price."
