Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  You have the security of John as a backup buyer at $800,000 if Bob rejects the offer. 

By aiming high initially, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal closer to Bob's maximum valuation."
