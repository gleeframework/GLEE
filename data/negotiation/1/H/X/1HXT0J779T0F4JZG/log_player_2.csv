``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no incentive to accept it immediately.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price. You have nothing to lose by trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the features you mentioned, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $125 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget considerations. I would like to make a counteroffer of $140 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a fair deal. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $140, which is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $150. Accepting this offer saves me $10 and gets me the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal, and it's likely Alice won't go lower."
