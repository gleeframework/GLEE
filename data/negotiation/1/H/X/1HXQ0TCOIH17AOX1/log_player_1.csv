"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, close to Bob's estimated value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This way, I maximize my potential profit while still leaving space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. I'm confident I can secure a deal closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still leaving some room for further negotiation. I believe this is a fair price, considering my minimum value and Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm within a few rounds of reaching the end of the negotiation, and I'm determined to get a higher price.  I'll see if I can get a bit closer to $12,000 with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $12,000. This is essentially meeting him in the middle, and hopefully, he will accept. I believe we are getting close to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's only $500 less than what I could get from John, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
