Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $11000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to keep going back and forth.  John is a guaranteed sale at $10,000, and I'd rather close the deal than continue negotiating with Bob."
