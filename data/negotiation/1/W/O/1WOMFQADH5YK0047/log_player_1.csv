Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's $15,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confidence:** The message is framed confidently, highlighting the product's value to Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing for certain that Bob values the product at $15,000. If she had more information, she might adjust her approach."
