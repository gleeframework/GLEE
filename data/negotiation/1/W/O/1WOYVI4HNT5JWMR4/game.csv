"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This reflects the value I see in the product and represents a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a significant concession from my original offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However,  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, which is a strong compromise from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make a living on this deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I'm eager to finalize this deal, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,900. This is a small step closer to your last offer and demonstrates my sincerity in making this purchase.  Let's try to bridge this small gap and finalize the transaction.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a fair price, and I'd like to meet you at $9,900, but I need to see some more movement from you. I'm willing to meet you at $9,950, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",9950.0,Alice,9,
