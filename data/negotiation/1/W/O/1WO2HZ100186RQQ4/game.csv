"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've done some research, and I found that similar products are selling for around that price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go as low as $107.50. How about we split the difference and go with $111.25? This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can still make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",111.25,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $109, which is still a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here. ",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $105 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer at $104.50. If you can meet me at this price, I'd be happy to buy the product from you.",104.5,Bob,6,
