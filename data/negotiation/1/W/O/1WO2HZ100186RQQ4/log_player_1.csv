"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've done some research, and I found that similar products are selling for around that price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $107.50 is better than his initial offer of $100, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $120. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go as low as $107.50. How about we split the difference and go with $111.25? This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can still make a decent profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 111.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is a bit closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to sell it for that low yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $109, which is still a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here. "", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $105 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer at $104.50. If you can meet me at this price, I'd be happy to buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $104.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already gone down significantly from my original asking price, and I don't want to keep going lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
