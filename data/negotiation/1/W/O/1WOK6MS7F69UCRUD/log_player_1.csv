Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate, while still getting a price closer to my minimum value."
