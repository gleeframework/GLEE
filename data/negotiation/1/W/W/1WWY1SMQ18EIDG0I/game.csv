"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable offering $1,200,000, which is a substantial amount and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
