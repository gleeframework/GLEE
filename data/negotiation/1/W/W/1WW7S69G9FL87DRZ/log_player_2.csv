Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his maximum budget of $120.  He can try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still above his budget. He can try to negotiate further or buy from John for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $165 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about wanting this product, and I'm willing to pay $140.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $165 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $152.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  He's already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's likely that Alice will not go any lower. It's better to secure the product from John for the price he's willing to pay."
