"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $165 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really serious about wanting this product, and I'm willing to pay $140.  This is my final offer.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $165 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $152.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",152.5,Alice,5,
