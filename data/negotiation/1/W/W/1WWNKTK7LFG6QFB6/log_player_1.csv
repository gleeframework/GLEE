Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a special price of $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $10,000 leaves no money on the table and immediately establishes the product's value.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** While the opening offer is firm, the message's tone suggests a possibility of discussion if Bob shows strong interest but hesitates at the initial price. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However,  since you have a backup buyer, you're not losing money by aiming high."
