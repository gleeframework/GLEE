Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you thinking of me, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
