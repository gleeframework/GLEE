"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while maintaining my target value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum value of $1,000,000 and we are already halfway through the negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of further rejection and potentially having to sell to John for less is not worth it at this point."
