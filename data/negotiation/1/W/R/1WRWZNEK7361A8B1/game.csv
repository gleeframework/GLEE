"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. My counteroffer is $1600000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I think this is a more reasonable compromise. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much on the table. My counteroffer is $1500000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
