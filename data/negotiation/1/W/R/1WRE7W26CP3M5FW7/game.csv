,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to consider $17,000? That feels like a fairer compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Can you meet me there?",14000.0,Bob,4,
