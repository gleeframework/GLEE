"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer of $1200000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's offer. Since you want to save as much money as possible, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility open that Alice might lower her price in the future."
