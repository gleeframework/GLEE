"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $12,000. I believe it's a bit higher than what you mentioned, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit lower than what I can accept right now.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? It's a fair price that still gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for us both.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value I'll get from the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
