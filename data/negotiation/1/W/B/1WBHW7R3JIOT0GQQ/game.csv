"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is very generous, but I'm really hoping to find a price point that works for both of us. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time.  I'm open to negotiating further, but this is the highest I can go at the moment.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your current offer, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. Let's meet halfway - how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
