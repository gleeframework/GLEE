Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your honesty, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?

$18,000 is still too high. Let's try to get closer to our budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

While $16,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I want to go. I can get the same product from John for $8,000. It's time to move on."
