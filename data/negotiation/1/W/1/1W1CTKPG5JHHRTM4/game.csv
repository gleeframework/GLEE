"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $925,000 is still a touch high. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a firm offer from my end.",900000.0,Bob,6,
