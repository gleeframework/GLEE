"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, given its potential. This is my maximum offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. I'm confident that's a price we can both live with.",925000.0,Alice,5,
