"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $850000 right now.  Let's work together and find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
