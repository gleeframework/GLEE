"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $16,000.  This price still offers you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $15,500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
