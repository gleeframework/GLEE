"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above his target of $15,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down to his target of $10,000. This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a good deal for both parties. It's a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still within Bob's target range of $15,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a reasonable price without risking the deal falling through or having to pay more to John."
