"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to John, and I can sell it to him at any time. Bob's offer is only slightly more than what I could get from John, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I will counteroffer to see if I can secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still fair given the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,750 is a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer, it's still below my target.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John if negotiations fail. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,750 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $10,900?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,900 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,800 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a good profit for me and Bob seems to be happy with the price. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
