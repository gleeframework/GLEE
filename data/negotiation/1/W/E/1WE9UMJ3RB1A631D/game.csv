"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still fair given the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,750 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $10,900?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,900 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  Let's meet in the middle.",10800.0,Bob,6,
