{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a good price, but I have 10 rounds to negotiate.  There's a strong chance I can get it for less.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a significant drop, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range considering my budget and the fact that I have multiple rounds to negotiate.  Alice may reject this offer, but it will give me a baseline for future negotiations."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial target of $450,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 475000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $475,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still want a price lower than her current offer.  It's a compromise that still leaves room for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to my target price, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll counteroffer one more time before considering buying from John.  I'm confident I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $500,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about reaching a deal. It's also a compromise, meeting her halfway from her last offer.  This offer creates a situation where Alice will likely either accept or counteroffer with something very close to my target price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price, but I'm still close to my target price. I have 3 rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal. I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get a price closer to $500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 525000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $525,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still want a price lower than her current offer.  This is the final counteroffer I'll make before considering buying from John. If Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than my initial target price, and we are in the final round. Although I'm close to getting a good deal with Alice,  it's not worth risking getting a higher price in the last round.  I'm going to buy from John at $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it ensures I get the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
