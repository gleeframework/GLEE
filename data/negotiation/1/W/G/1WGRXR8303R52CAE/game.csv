"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm interested in exploring other options. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,050,000. This reflects the unique advantages this product offers and leaves us both with a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential returns on investment.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you've made some compelling points, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,975,000. I'm confident this product can generate significant returns for you.  However,  I've also had strong interest from other parties.  Holding off on those opportunities comes at a cost, and I believe this revised offer reflects a fair balance between value and my own position.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,975,000 is the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,925,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential returns on investment. I'm getting close to considering other options, including John's offer of $1,000,000.",1925000.0,Bob,6,
