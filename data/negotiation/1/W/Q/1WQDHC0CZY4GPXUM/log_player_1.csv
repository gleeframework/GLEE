Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see how interested Bob is and gauge his potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,200,000. This is a more realistic price point that still leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring I get more than the minimum I'm willing to accept."
