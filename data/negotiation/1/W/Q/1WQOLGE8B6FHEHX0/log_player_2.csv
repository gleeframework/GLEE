"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from her, closer to her $8,000 value."
