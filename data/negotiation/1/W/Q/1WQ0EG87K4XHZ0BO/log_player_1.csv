Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price of $20,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a profit above your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is structured to gauge Bob's interest and invite a counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
