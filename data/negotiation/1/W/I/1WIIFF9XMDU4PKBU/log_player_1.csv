Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $11,000 gives Bob a $1,000 incentive to buy from you rather than seek alternatives. This price also secures a significant profit for you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,000, there might be a slight possibility to negotiate a bit higher, depending on Bob's response."
