"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $1,500,000 and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000, which is a savings of $300,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means paying more.** If you reject, you'll end up paying John $1,500,000, losing the potential savings."
