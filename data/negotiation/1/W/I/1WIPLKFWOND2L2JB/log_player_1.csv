I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob. If he rejects it, I'll have to consider if his counteroffer is worth it or if I should just sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I'll try to get a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good profit for me, but it might be more appealing to Bob than my original $20,000 asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is below my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
