"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open communication:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and start a dialogue. 

This strategy is a good starting point. It balances my need for a high price with the need to engage Bob in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, and I'm interested in buying it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price:** $900,000 is less than my floor of $1,000,000.
* **I have time and options:** I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price.

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 for the product. This still reflects its true value, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still holding firm on a price higher than his initial offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's true value to justify my price.

I'm aiming for a middle ground that is closer to my desired price while remaining open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $950,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already in Round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left to negotiate.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, with no risk of further negotiations.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of continuing with Bob is too high. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John and avoid the possibility of losing out completely."
