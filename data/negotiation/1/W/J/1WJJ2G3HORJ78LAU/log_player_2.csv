"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price, closer to our $800,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** We're starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to try and shift the negotiation in our favor. This establishes a lower anchor point, even if it's unlikely to be immediately accepted.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By offering $600,000, we leave space to gradually increase our offer during subsequent rounds while still aiming to stay well below our $800,000 limit.
* **Expressing interest:**  We don't want to appear disinterested, so we clearly state that we are interested in the product but need a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is coming down, but $850,000 is still above our absolute limit of $800,000. 
* We have time for further negotiation, and it's worth seeing if we can get Alice closer to our target. 
*  John's offer acts as a strong backup, so we're not desperate to accept a price above our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:**  We acknowledge Alice's movement on price to show we're negotiating in good faith.
* **Justified counter:** We explain that $850,000 is still too high for our budget, keeping our position consistent.
* **Compromise and midpoint:** By proposing $725,000, we're suggesting a compromise that is exactly halfway between her last offer ($850,000) and our previous offer ($600,000).  This framing can make our offer seem more reasonable.
* **Still below our limit:** Importantly, our offer keeps us comfortably below our $800,000 maximum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000, which is a significant compromise. This price reflects the value the product brings to you, and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's try to find common ground at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At our limit:** Alice's offer of $800,000 matches our absolute maximum price. We cannot get a better deal from her.
* **Equals John's offer:**  We can get the same price from John without further negotiation. 
* **Time saved:** Accepting now saves time and potential risk of Alice increasing her price again in further rounds. 

While we could try to negotiate further, it's highly unlikely Alice will go below $800,000. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome."
