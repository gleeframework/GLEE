"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000, which is a significant compromise. This price reflects the value the product brings to you, and allows us both to make a good deal. Let's try to find common ground at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
