"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential benefits from owning it. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $650,000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $750,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more in the range of $700,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $700,000. I can offer you a price of $725,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
