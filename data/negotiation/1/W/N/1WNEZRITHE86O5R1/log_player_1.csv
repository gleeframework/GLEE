"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic but Realistic:**  $175 is a good starting point, allowing for potential concessions while still getting a price closer to my minimum value of $150.
* **Friendly Approach:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While I could sell to John for $150, I still have room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, potentially earning more. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to make a counteroffer, hopefully moving the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession by coming down from $175 to $140, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to keep the cost under $120. Would $110 be within your consideration? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $110 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price and potentially more rounds, eating into my time and risking a lower final deal.

It's better to sell to John now and secure a price that meets my minimum requirements."
