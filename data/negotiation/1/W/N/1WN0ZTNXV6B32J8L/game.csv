"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a good profit margin.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to secure the product while still staying within a reasonable price point.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's closer to your budget and still allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's finalize this deal!",940000.0,Alice,5,
