Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room to negotiate down while still staying well above my minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob truly is and how he values the product. 
* **John as Backup:** I have the security of John's offer, allowing me to negotiate confidently with Bob and walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it and end the negotiation, there's room to try and secure a better deal. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my starting point to see if there's any flexibility on his end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by moving significantly down from my initial offer.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price still keeps me well above my baseline of $1,200,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help me gauge how much Bob is willing to budge. If he's completely inflexible, I can always accept his previous offer or move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the unique features of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly rooted at my absolute minimum price.  He's shown no willingness to move significantly from that point. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
