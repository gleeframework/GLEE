Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (the minimum she'll accept)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000 (the maximum he's willing to pay)
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $1,500,000 

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice has a guaranteed sale at her reservation price with John. Therefore, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing she has a fallback option.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, Alice should aim slightly below this to entice him while still maximizing her profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000.  This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Creates Urgency:**  The message implies scarcity and a limited-time opportunity, prompting Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation (Slightly):** While the offer is already attractive, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing Alice's potential gain.
* **Strong Fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and proceeds to sell to John at her desired price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no significant costs associated with delaying the sale."
