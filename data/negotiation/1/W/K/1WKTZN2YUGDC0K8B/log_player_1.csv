Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoid a Too-High Price:**  If I start too high, Bob might reject the offer outright. This price still ensures a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price ($120)."
