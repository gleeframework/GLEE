"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a better deal from Alice in further rounds, and it's best to secure the product at the desired price."
