,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's a great deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $87.50? That's the lowest I can go.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $89. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $89 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. That's the lowest I can go.",87.5,Bob,6,
