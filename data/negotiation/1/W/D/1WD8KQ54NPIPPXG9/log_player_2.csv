"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is asking $200.  It's too high, so rejecting and counteroffering is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  It's still a fair price for both of us, since the product is worth $150 to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$180 is still too high for me. I will counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going up slightly from my previous offer, but still below Alice's asking price.  This shows I'm serious about buying and willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not worth it to me. I can still get the product from John for $150, so I'll reject Alice's offer and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

This is my final offer. It's the price I'm willing to pay, and it's the same as what John is selling it for. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John."
