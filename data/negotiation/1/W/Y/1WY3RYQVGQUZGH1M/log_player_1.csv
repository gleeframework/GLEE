Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This offer starts high, aiming to get as close to Bob's value as possible. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm confident this offer is a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum than John's offer, I still believe I can get closer to Bob's value of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to $11,500 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $11,250. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to secure a deal without risking losing Bob completely."
