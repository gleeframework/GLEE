"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $600,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth to you and the value you'll get from it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $750,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still pushing my budget constraints.  To be completely honest, I've also been exploring other options.  If you're able to come down to $800,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I might need to consider those other options seriously.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about exploring other options. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,7,
