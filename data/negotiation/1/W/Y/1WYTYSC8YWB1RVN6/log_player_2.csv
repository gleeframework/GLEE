"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value. It's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice has room to negotiate:**  Alice wants at least $8,000 and her starting offer is $10,000. This suggests she might be willing to go lower.
* **You have a backup plan:** You know John will sell you the product for $12,000.  This gives you leverage.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for a counter-offer that could save you even more money."
