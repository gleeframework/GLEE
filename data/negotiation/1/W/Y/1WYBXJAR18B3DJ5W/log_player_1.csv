Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I think I can do better than that. How about we try $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now significantly undervaluing the product. We need to hold firm to a price closer to our minimum while signaling that we're willing to negotiate. Selling to John is still a good backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000. This offer takes into account both the product's worth and your interest. Let's make this deal happen."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $1,350,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While not ideal, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is reasonably close to John's guaranteed offer. It's risky to push further, especially since Bob has declared it his final offer. Accepting now avoids potentially losing both offers and getting a lower price."
