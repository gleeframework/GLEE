"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $120 to you, you are not willing to pay anything more than that. Alice's offer is for $120, which is your maximum price.  However, you can get the product from John for the same price, so it's better to reject Alice's offer."
