Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a backup offer that guarantees you your minimum desired price. This allows you to aim high with Bob, knowing you won't be worse off if he declines. 

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Target:** The offer price of $1,350,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value the product holds for Bob ($1,500,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to haggle. 
* **Backup Security:** If Bob rejects this offer, you're still securing your minimum price of $1,000,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are confident in John's willingness to buy at $1,000,000."
