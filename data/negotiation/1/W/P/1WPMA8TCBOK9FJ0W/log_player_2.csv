"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,500. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000, there's room for negotiation. You know you have John as a backup option at $12,000. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her $8,000 value."
