"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,800 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident that we can find a deal that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to pay $10,600,  Let's see if we can finalize this.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,600 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
