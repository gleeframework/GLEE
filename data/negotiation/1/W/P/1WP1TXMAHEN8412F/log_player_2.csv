"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and he can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price point.  He can try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his $9,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,200. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $11,200 is still too high for Bob, and he has already rejected a lower offer from her.  He's already used 5 rounds of negotiation.  While he could continue, he's unlikely to get much lower than $11,000.  John's offer is the best option to get the product for his maximum price point."
