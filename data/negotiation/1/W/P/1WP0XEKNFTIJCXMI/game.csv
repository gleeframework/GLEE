"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? That's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,3,
