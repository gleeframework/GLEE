"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $925,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I think the product's value is worth more to me than that. Let's try to find a sweet spot. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
