Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1200000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. Can we meet at $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $1,200,000 offer, and I've already lowered my price.  While I could keep negotiating, it's clear he's not willing to budge much.  It's not worth risking another few rounds to potentially get a slightly better offer. I'll take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
