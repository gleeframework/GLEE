,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1200000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. My counteroffer is $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1050000. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $975000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer is $1075000. This is my last attempt to meet you in the middle. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1075000. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I've made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1075000. However, I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer is $1025000. This is my last serious offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $980000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from another supplier. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,10,
