"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount of money. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if a lower price can be achieved.  There's potential to save a considerable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a strong negotiating position. While this price might be too low for Alice to accept immediately, it's a good starting point for further negotiations.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down considerably from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $750,000 is a significant improvement from her previous price of $850,000.  It's now within my acceptable range, and it's a better price than what I'd get from John.  Accepting this offer allows me to save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While there might be a chance to negotiate even lower, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer or walking away from the deal entirely is too high."
