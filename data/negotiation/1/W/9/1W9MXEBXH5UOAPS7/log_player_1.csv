"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone might make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, which could make Bob feel like it's a reasonable starting point.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls or I don't feel confident about reaching a good price, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  While I want to close the deal, accepting $5,000 would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **There are still 8 rounds left.**  This gives me time to negotiate further with Bob. I want to see if we can find a compromise closer to my minimum. 

**Next Steps:**

* **I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round.** I'll aim for a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still potentially attractive to Bob.
* **If the negotiations continue to stall, or Bob's offers remain too low, I will consider selling to John in a future round.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $12,000 to $9,000. This shows willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price within my acceptable range. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, highlighting the potential benefit he'll receive even at $9,000.
* **Open to Discussion:**  My message conveys a desire to reach an agreement, inviting Bob to continue the conversation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully assess whether Bob is willing to move closer to my price point or if his offers remain significantly lower. 
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects my offer again, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer, potentially lowering my price slightly, but not too much.
* **Consider Selling to John:** If Bob's offers stay too low or the negotiations become unproductive, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While $7,000 is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's still not a good deal for me considering my minimum is $15,000.
* **There are still 6 rounds left.**  This gives me enough time to continue negotiating with Bob. I believe we can still reach a more favorable price for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **I will make a counteroffer in the next round.** I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price point, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider.
* **If negotiations continue to stall, I will seriously consider selling to John.**  I don't want to waste too much time with Bob if he's unwilling to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm refusing to go lower than $8,500, which is still above my minimum acceptable price. However, it's a significant compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway his decision and make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Finality:** I imply that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully assess Bob's response to see if he's willing to accept my offer or if he wants to counter.
* **Prepare for Selling to John:** If Bob rejects my offer again, I'll start considering selling to John in the next round. My time is getting limited, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal with John.
* **Potentially Lower Price:** If Bob is close to accepting, but still wants to negotiate, I might consider a small price reduction in the next round. However, I'll only do this if I'm confident that I'll be able to close the deal."
