"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product for a price of $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000, Alice.  How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
