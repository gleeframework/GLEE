Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Being polite and showing interest in Bob as a buyer:**  ""Hi Bob, I think it would be perfect for you.""
* **Setting a price higher than your minimum:** $130 is above the $120 minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Showing flexibility:** ""I'm open to negotiation."" This encourages Bob to counter-offer and helps keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice,  $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $120. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's final offer is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to sell to him now than risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for the same price."
