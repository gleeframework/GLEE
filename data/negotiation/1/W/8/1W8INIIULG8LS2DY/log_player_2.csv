"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice for $120 when you can get it from John for $100. You should reject Alice's offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

You are trying to buy the product for as low a price as possible.  Offering $90 is a good starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still reflects the product's value to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

You've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate.  By increasing your offer slightly to $95, you demonstrate you're serious about buying from her, while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is slowly coming down in price, but it's still not worth it to accept $105 when you can buy it from John for $100.  You should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

You're getting closer to Alice's desired price point, but you still need to save a little more.  By offering $98, you show Alice you're serious about a deal while still leaving room for a final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's tempting to accept Alice's offer of $99, but you're so close to your goal of getting the product for $98.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making one final counteroffer might be the best way to get the deal you want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

You've already offered $98 before, and Alice rejected it. However, this was after several rounds of back and forth, and you've shown your willingness to compromise. It's worth a final try to see if Alice will accept your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $99.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's a tough call, but accepting Alice's offer of $99.5 is the best option. While you're only getting $0.50 off what you could get from John, this is the best deal you're likely to get from Alice. With only one round remaining, there's no guarantee you could negotiate a lower price."
