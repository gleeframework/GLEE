"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While Alice may not accept the first counteroffer, continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price.  Buying from John at $800,000 would be a last resort if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but at $700,000 it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to negotiate. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $675,000 which is only $25,000 more than Bob's counteroffer.  It's a good deal for Bob considering he can save $125,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance that further negotiation with Alice won't result in a significantly lower price, so accepting her offer is the best move for Bob."
