"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $12,000 to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer, or you can purchase from John for a guaranteed better price."
