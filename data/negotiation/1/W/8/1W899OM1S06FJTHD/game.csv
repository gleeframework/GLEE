"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is still quite a ways off. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
