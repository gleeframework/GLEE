Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable value. This allows room for potential bargaining and leaves some potential profit if Bob accepts it immediately. It's important to gauge Bob's reaction to this initial offer and adjust accordingly in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob. Even if you don't get a higher price, you have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is still above your minimum acceptable price, but it shows willingness to negotiate. It's a compromise from your initial offer, but it still allows for potential profit. This should give Bob a reasonable offer to consider, while also demonstrating that you're not willing to sell for significantly less than your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's becoming increasingly likely that you won't be able to negotiate a price you're happy with.  John is offering your minimum acceptable price, so it's the most sensible option to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
