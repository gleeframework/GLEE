Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you'll find great value in it. I'm asking for $17,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000, giving you a baseline for negotiation.
* **Anchoring High:**  Starting with an offer of $17,000 sets a high anchor. While this is above Bob's valuation, it leaves room for negotiation and makes any counteroffer from Bob likely to be closer to your desired price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who will pay your minimum price. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes you have some leeway to negotiate. If you believe Bob is a particularly tough negotiator or unwilling to go above his valuation, you might adjust your initial offer slightly lower.
* **Relationship Importance:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a less aggressive opening offer."
