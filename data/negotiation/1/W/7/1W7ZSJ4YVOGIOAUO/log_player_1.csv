Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you given the value you've placed on the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my seriousness in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below what I need. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, $950,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
