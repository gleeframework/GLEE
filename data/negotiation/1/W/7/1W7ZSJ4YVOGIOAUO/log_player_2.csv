Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, $950,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000. She knows the product's value to you and is using that to her advantage. You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It's time to cut your losses and secure the deal with John."
