"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you given the value you've placed on the product. Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my seriousness in acquiring this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the increase in your offer. However, $950,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
