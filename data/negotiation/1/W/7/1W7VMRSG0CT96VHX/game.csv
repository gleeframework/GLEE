"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'd be willing to pay $150 for it.  What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $175. Would you be interested in that?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $160?  It's closer to your price and my budget, and I think it's a fair compromise.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $160. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. How about we meet at $170? It's a bit higher than your offer, but it's still a good compromise.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to be fair here, and I understand you need to make a profit.  How about $165? That's a small step up from my previous offer and still within my budget.  Let's close this deal!",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $165, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll sell it to you for $170, and I'll also include a free accessory that's worth $20. That way, you'll get a great deal and I'll still make a profit. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,7,
