"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a lower price can be negotiated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to push for a lower price in the next round to maximize his savings. Buying from John at this point would mean losing any potential savings from negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $10,000, which is the value I placed on the product.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
