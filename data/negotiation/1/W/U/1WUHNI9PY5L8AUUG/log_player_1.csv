"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is more than my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm being optimistic and hoping Bob will accept quickly, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $95. This is still a good deal for Bob as it's well below the value he places on the product. It also shows flexibility on my part, while maintaining my goal of getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway.  $92 seems like a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $92 is a good price, and it's better than the $80 I'd get from John. It's also likely that if I reject his offer, we'll continue going back and forth with small price changes, and I might not get a better deal.  It's time to close this deal!"
