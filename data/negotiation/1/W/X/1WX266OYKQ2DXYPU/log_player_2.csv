"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, Bob. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000. Even though Bob values the product at $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him $100,000."
