Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to settle for anything less than that amount."
