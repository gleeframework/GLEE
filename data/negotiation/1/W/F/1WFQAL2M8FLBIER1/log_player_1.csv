{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $17,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to ensure I get a decent price."
