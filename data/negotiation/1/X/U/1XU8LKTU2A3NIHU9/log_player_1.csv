{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  A friendly and persuasive message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.  

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Get the negotiation started:**  A concrete offer encourages Bob to respond.
* **Secure a good price:** $10,000 is a significant profit for you while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  You can lower the price slightly if needed, but not below your minimum of $12,000 (John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  While I could sell to John immediately for $12,000, there's still potential to get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This is a compromise price, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Bob's offer while reaffirming the product's value. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to:
    * **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I keep control of the negotiation.
    * **Move closer to my target:** $9,500 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer.
    * **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  This counteroffer shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a slightly lower price to try and push Bob closer to my desired value. There's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for significantly less than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I can come down to $9,400.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,400:** This is a small concession, signaling flexibility while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** The message reiterates the value proposition of the product and reinforces the desire to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain a negotiating edge:** I'm not giving in too quickly, but I'm showing willingness to compromise.
* **Maximize potential profit:** $9,400 is still closer to my target than John's offer.
* **Increase urgency:**  The message subtly encourages Bob to accept the offer before he loses the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $9,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's clear that further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs.  Therefore, the best course of action is to sell the product to John for $12,000. 

This decision ensures that I get the best possible price for the product and avoid further negotiation with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower price."
