,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I can come down to $9,400.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",9400.0,Alice,5,
