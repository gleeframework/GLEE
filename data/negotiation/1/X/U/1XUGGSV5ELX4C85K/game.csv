"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm not comfortable with $10,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is just too far below my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
