"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down. I appreciate the movement towards a compromise. To be honest, my budget caps out at $800,000 for this product. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
