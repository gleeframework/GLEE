"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's ample room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This strategy aims to:
    * Gauge Alice's flexibility.
    * Potentially secure a highly favorable deal early on. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, it leaves ample room for negotiation within your $800,000 limit.
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option of going with John's offer, so there's less risk in starting low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Limit:** Alice's counteroffer is still $100,000 over your maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to your range.
* **Potential for Compromise:** There's room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down. I appreciate the movement towards a compromise. To be honest, my budget caps out at $800,000 for this product. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** Being upfront about your maximum budget can sometimes expedite negotiations. It signals to Alice that you're serious and have a firm limit.
* **Final Offer:** Presenting this as your best offer adds weight and encourages Alice to accept, knowing you have John as a backup option.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might walk away, but it's a calculated one.  You've significantly narrowed the gap, and she might be willing to accept your maximum to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice has backtracked and increased her offer after you presented your maximum budget. This suggests she might not be willing to negotiate within your acceptable range.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only five rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate with Alice carries a risk. She might continue to hold out for a price above your limit. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:** Buying from John guarantees you stay within your budget and saves you a substantial $300,000 compared to Alice's current offer. 

It's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure a good deal with John."
