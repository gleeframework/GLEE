"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1100000.  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit above the price I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $900000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1000000?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  I'm open to discussing further if you have another proposal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
