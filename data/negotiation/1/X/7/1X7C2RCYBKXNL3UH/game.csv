"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1,300,000? This still gives you a significant savings and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. How about $1,300,000 minus $20,000? I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
