Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product would be valuable to me, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum. It's highly unlikely he'll go up to $14,000. I'll try to meet him in the middle.
