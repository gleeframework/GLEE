Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate, aiming to get closer to your target price of $800,000."

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate, but I need to be careful to avoid getting stuck in a price range that is too high."
