**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $1,020,000 is still above my maximum. It's likely that further negotiation would involve small incremental changes. It's more efficient and financially advantageous to buy from John at $800,000."
