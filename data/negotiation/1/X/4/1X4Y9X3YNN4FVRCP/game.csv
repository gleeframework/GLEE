"While I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $850,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's try $900,000. This would be a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",1020000.0,Alice,5,,
