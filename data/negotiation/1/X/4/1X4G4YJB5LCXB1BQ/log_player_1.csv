Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $145. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while still being competitive given that Bob values the product at $150.  I'm confident I can get a good deal, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is not willing to budge on his price, and I've already made a counteroffer.  It's clear that we won't be able to agree on a price. Since John is offering my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John."
