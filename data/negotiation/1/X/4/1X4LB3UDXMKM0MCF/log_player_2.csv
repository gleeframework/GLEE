"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. This is a great deal, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is $135.** This is below your maximum price of $150.
* **Buying from John costs $150.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
