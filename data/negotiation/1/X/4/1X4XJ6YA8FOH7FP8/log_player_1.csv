Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **My Minimum:** I won't accept less than $10,000, as I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Potential Gain:** A price of $11,500 gives me a significant gain over John's offer while still being attractive to Bob.

By offering a price slightly closer to my minimum than to Bob's maximum, I'm hoping to strike a balance that incentivizes Bob to accept while ensuring I maximize my profit."
