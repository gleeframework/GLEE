"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it's really valuable, but I'm open to offers. How does $150 sound to start?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I can sell the product to John for the same price without further negotiation. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed sale with John and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
