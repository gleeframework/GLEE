Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

While I could push Alice further, she's signaled this is her final offer. Accepting at $825,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's $1,200,000 price.  Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and risks losing the deal entirely."
