"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to my minimum price, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $810000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",810000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's not worth going any lower. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I can offer it to you for $820000, but I need to stress that this is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've already said that $820000 is as low as I'm willing to go, and you've come back with an offer that's still $25000 below that. I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $815000, but that's it. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",815000.0,Alice,9,
