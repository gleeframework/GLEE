"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $120 to Bob.  Alice's initial offer of $150 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This signals to Alice that he is serious about negotiating and sets a lower starting point for the negotiation. Offering $100 leaves room for both parties to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is closer to Bob's maximum price of $120, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and get a lower price, as there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate.  He's likely to get a better price if he continues to make counteroffers that are close to his maximum price.  A counteroffer of $115 is only $5 away from his maximum price of $120, leaving room for compromise. This also signals to Alice that he is getting closer to his limit and might be willing to accept an offer close to $115."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still too high.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price since he has several rounds left.  It's still possible to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum price point, but it's worth pushing for that final $5 discount. Offering $120 signals that he's serious about closing the deal and is willing to pay his maximum. Alice might be willing to accept this offer to avoid losing the sale, especially as there are only a few rounds left."
