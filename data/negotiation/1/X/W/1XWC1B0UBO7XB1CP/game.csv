"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,275,000. Could we perhaps aim for $1,250,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
