"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. I'm hoping to get close to my ideal price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can get a price closer to my ideal price of $12,000. There are still several rounds left, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
