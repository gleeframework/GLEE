Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a price that is 20% higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully earn a good profit.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer, especially considering Bob's interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's below my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still stay above my minimum.  $1,650,000 is a fair compromise, and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer.  Since I'm not looking to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,500,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired price and secures the sale."
