I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This price is higher than John's offer, giving me the potential for a larger profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting with a higher price and hoping he's willing to pay it. If he rejects, I'll still be able to sell it to John for $1,500,000."
