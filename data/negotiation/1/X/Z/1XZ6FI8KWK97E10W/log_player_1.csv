I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still allows for a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to John's price, it's still above my minimum value. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I sell the product without risking further negotiation or potentially ending up with John's lower price."
