Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high value and demand without explicitly stating your minimum. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a fantastic deal at $1,500,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to negotiate down to a price still above $1,000,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You sell to John at your guaranteed price, meeting your minimum."
