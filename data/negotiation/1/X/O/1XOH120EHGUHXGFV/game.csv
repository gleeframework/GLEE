"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,050,000? It's a compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $925,000? That's a significant move on my part.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move towards a deal, but $925,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close, but that jump is still too much for me.  I'd be willing to go to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,6,
