Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Power:** Alice has a strong position because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's Motivation:** Bob stands to gain $300,000 in value if he can buy the product ($1,500,000 value - $1,200,000 cost).
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,000 (Bob's minimum) and $1,500,000 (Alice's minimum).

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for negotiation to entice Bob while still maximizing her profit. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Strong Starting Point:** It's close to Alice's guaranteed price, maximizing her potential profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $50,000 difference allows for some back-and-forth, making Bob feel more involved.
* **Value Justification:** The message highlights the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly reminding Bob of the $300,000 potential gain.

**Important Note:**  Alice should be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price that's acceptable to her. She has a strong fallback option with John."
