"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",100.0,Alice,5,
