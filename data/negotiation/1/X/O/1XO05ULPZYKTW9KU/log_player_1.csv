"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to me and potentially more to Bob.  This initial offer is an aggressive tactic to see if Bob is willing to negotiate significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob.  I have 8 rounds left before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob is willing to pay $900,000, which is closer to my value than the initial $1,200,000. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still trying to get a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding out for a price above $1 million. I'm confident that Bob values the product more than $950,000 and will be willing to meet me in the middle. I have 5 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting close to my minimum price, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $1,000,000.  There's still potential for Bob to increase his offer, so I'm going to push for another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

This is my final counteroffer before I have to decide between selling to Bob or John. I'm confident that Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I'm hoping to get a bit closer to that with my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm only one round away from having to sell to John. Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold, but it's still not enough to make it worth the risk of another round of negotiation.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a much safer option."
