Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $141.25. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $141.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $141.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $140. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $150 rather than risk Alice increasing her price or the negotiation going nowhere."
