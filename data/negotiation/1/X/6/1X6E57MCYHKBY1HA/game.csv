Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. I think it's a fair price considering the product's quality and uniqueness.,175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $175 is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $155. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $130? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise given the product's value.",142.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $141.25. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",141.25,Alice,7,
