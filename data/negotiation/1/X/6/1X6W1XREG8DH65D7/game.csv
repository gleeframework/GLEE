"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and found that similar products are selling for upwards of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,500? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,750. It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm confident it's still a great value for you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great value for you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Alice,7,
