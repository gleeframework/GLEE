"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for that price.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $11,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a little more before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm ready to close the deal right now if you're willing to meet me at $11,200. This saves me a bit more and allows us to wrap things up. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm not willing to go below $11,500.  $11,200 is too close to my minimum and I don't want to lose out on a better offer.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more, or I might have to consider selling to John."
