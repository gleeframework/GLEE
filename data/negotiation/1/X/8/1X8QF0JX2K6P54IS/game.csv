"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I understand your perspective, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves some room for profit for you. Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
