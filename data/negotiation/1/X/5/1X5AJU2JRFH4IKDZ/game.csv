"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will bring you significant return. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let me know what you think.  If you aren't interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
