{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% reduction from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows my seriousness in getting a good deal. If she rejects, we can continue negotiating, and I'll adjust my offers based on her responses."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer but still lower than John's price. There's still room to negotiate a better price. I'll reject the offer and continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and gauge Alice's flexibility."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to her original asking price, but it's still worth trying to get a better deal. I'll reject and counter-offer again, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000, which is the midpoint between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good price. If Alice rejects, we'll be closer to the midpoint and I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are now getting closer to her original asking price and above the price I'm willing to pay.  The negotiations have reached a point where I'm not likely to get a significantly better deal from Alice. It's better to stop the negotiation and buy from John at the fixed price of $1,200,000."
