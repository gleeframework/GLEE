{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. It also positions me to potentially earn more than John's offer, but I'm willing to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my minimum value. I believe I can negotiate a better price and am willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows for a successful partnership."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I am still working within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000 for your product. This price reflects its value while staying as close as possible to my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is now very close to my minimum value.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm worried that if I reject him, he might walk away, or I might not be able to get a better price in subsequent rounds.  At this point, selling to Bob for $960,000 is the best option available to me."
