"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows for a successful partnership.",975000.0,Alice,3,
