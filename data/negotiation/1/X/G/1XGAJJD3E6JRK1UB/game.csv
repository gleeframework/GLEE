"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Knowing your discerning taste and this product's potential value to you, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about $1,320,000?",1320000.0,Bob,6,
