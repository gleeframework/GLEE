{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20,000. It's a steal considering its value! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum. This allows for some negotiation room, while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'd love to get more than $15,000 for the product, it seems like Bob is firm on his price. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale, I'll go ahead and sell it to John for $15,000."
