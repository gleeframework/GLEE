"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $135 is better than her initial value of $150, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door for you to buy it at your desired price point."
