"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a good price, but it also leaves Bob a good margin to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I am serious about getting a good price and hopefully get him to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $11,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves a comfortable margin for me. It's also halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer, making it a more attractive compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a good price, I believe I can push for a slightly higher offer.  Bob's offer shows he's serious about buying, but I still have room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my last offer. This will keep the negotiation moving and show Bob I'm willing to meet halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering the price to $10,500. This is a small decrease from my last offer, showing Bob I'm willing to compromise, but it still leaves a healthy profit margin for me. This offer also strategically positions me between Bob's last offer and my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting close to my minimum threshold. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and continuing to haggle risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit while minimizing the risk of ending up with nothing."
