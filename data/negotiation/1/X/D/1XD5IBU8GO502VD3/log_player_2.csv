"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I understand its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find this proposition compelling.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating the product's maximum worth to you ($1,000,000) and starting the negotiation at that exact price. This leaves no room for you to save money.  You can do just as well buying from John without going through a negotiation."
