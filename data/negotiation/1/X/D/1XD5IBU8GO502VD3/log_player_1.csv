Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I understand its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find this proposition compelling.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob and emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation. This approach aims to build trust and encourage him to consider a deal.
* **Product Price:** I'm initially setting the price at $1,000,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob is interested. 

By starting with this approach, I can potentially secure a higher price from Bob while still having the safety net of selling to John if necessary."
