Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to capitalize on his potential willingness to pay a premium. I've also included a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair deal considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept his current offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is still below what I believe the product is truly worth. I will counter with a slightly higher price in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your eagerness to buy, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go to $825,000. This is a compromise on my end, and a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a good product, but we're running out of time. I'm willing to offer you $800,000 even though I can get it for that price elsewhere.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 matches my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd ideally like to sell for a higher price, I'm confident this is a fair deal given the time constraints and the fact that I can sell to John for the same amount."
