"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair deal considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your eagerness to buy, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go to $825,000. This is a compromise on my end, and a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a good product, but we're running out of time. I'm willing to offer you $800,000 even though I can get it for that price elsewhere.  Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
