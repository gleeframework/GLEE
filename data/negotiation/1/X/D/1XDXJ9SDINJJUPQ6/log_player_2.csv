"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's significantly lower but still potentially profitable for her. This is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of pushing for a lower price. He's increased his offer slightly, but still well below Alice's last offer. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but he still has room to negotiate and get a better price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since Bob has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final push. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and this offer is just at her threshold.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will be forced to choose between accepting Alice's next counteroffer or buying from John.  However, by offering $8,000, Bob is demonstrating his commitment to negotiating a fair price, hoping Alice will accept and avoid losing the sale."
