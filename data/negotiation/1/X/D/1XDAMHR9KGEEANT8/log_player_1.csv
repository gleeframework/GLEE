"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer because $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a more favorable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to show flexibility, but I'm still above my minimum price of $12,000. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not ideal.  I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm willing to lower my price further to $11,000 to show that I'm serious about closing the deal. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value.  This is my last counteroffer before I seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal selling point. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to close a deal closer to my desired price. I have 4 rounds left before I must decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $11,500, showing that I'm flexible but also determined to get a fair price. This is a crucial round as I only have 3 remaining before I have to decide between Bob and John."
