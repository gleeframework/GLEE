Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I know you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim slightly below your minimum ($150) to entice Bob while exceeding his valuation ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:**  Knowing John will buy it for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost any potential earnings."
