"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you say?

You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $100, but I need to make a bit more on this sale. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's unlikely to go as low as $100. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk further negotiation rounds and potentially miss out."
