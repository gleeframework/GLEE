"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me is $12,000, but I'm trying to save some money. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,250? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another offer, $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
