Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than $8,000, so you're not giving it away.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a $2,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for some back-and-forth.
* **It's a friendly tone:**  Starting with a positive and friendly message can make Bob more receptive to your offer. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price if Bob rejects your offer.  You can also  use the information from Bob's counter-offers to improve your negotiating strategy.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me is $12,000, but I'm trying to save some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $10,000 and you believe the product is worth more. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. There's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, especially since he acknowledged the product's value to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,250? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It's a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a good margin:**  $9,250 is still above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring a profit.
* **Highlight value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value, encouraging him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another offer, $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. It's close to your initial counteroffer of $9,250 and is still well above your minimum of $8,000.  It's a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a successful sale."
