Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000...""** This message is friendly and straightforward,  setting the stage for a productive negotiation.

**Why this strategy?**

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming to encourage him to consider the offer while still leaving room for negotiation. This approach also avoids a quick rejection and allows for a potential counteroffer, increasing the chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially bridging the gap between our desired prices. It also demonstrates that I'm committed to a fair deal but not willing to undervalue my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for a product like this. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $9,500:** This price is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. It demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring I receive a decent price for the product.
* **""I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal...""** This message is friendly and assertive, highlighting the value of the product while expressing a willingness to negotiate.
* **""Let's meet in the middle...""** This phrase encourages a collaborative approach and suggests that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward and increase the chances of a successful sale while ensuring I don't sacrifice too much of my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low. I'm determined to maximize my profit, and I believe there's still room for a better deal.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the remaining gap.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $9,000 is still just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $9,250:**  This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates continued flexibility while still remaining within a reasonable range for me. 
* **""I'm willing to meet you halfway again...""**:  This reinforces a collaborative approach and shows that I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **""This would be a fair price for both of us...""**:  This statement emphasizes that I believe this offer is equitable, further encouraging Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale without jeopardizing my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to pay $9,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite enough for me to consider accepting it. I've already made several concessions, and I'm confident that John will offer me my desired price of $12,000.  Negotiating further with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a less favorable outcome. 

Selling to John ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at my desired price, maximizing my profit."
