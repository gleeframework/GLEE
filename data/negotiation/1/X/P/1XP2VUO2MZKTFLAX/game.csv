"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for a product like this. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $9,000 is still just a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to pay $9,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
