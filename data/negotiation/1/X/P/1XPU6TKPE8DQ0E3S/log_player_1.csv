Bob's offer:

While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $700,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch above my budget. I could do $850,000.  That's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his current offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
