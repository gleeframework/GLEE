"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential ROI for you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $800,000 falls short of what I'm looking for. To move things forward, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of this product.
