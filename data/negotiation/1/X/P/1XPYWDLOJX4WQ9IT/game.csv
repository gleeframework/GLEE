"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the product price at $1,250,000? This offers a slight increase from my initial offer while still providing a significant discount from the product's value to you. I believe this could be a fair solution for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this time.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
