Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and while my asking price is $1,450,000, I'm willing to make this a smooth transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first at a price slightly below your guaranteed amount gives you a chance to earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to your alternative buyer. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The message leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential earnings."
