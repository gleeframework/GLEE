"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my top offer, considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value and my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to make this work, and I appreciate your efforts. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's try to finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I understand the value of the product, and I'm willing to go as high as $9,000 to close this deal. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. ",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. This is my final offer before I move on to other buyers.  Let's close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,7,
