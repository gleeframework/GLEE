Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my top offer, considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $8,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value and my budget. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I understand the value of the product, and I'm willing to go as high as $9,000 to close this deal. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
