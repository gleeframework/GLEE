"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer takes into consideration its market value while acknowledging the unique benefits it offers.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $1,450,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with the market value and takes into account the unique benefits of the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I see your point about the market value, but this product offers advantages that others don't.  To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,375,000. This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
