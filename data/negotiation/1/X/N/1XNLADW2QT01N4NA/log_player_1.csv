This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is advantageous to me, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not giving away the product for its minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $800,000? That's still a great deal for you, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $800,000 is your minimum, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  Would you be willing to go up to $790,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $790,000. How about we try $780,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $780,000 is getting close to my minimum and it seems like further negotiation might be fruitless.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing him altogether and having to settle for John's offer."
