"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $800,000? That's still a great deal for you, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $800,000 is your minimum, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  Would you be willing to go up to $790,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",790000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $790,000. How about we try $780,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",780000.0,Bob,6,
