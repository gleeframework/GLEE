"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to move forward with the deal at that price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
