"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice's offer is $100. This leaves some room for negotiation to get a better price.
* I want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $95 is still within my budget of $120 and closer to my initial counteroffer of $90. 
* Accepting this offer allows me to save $25 compared to buying from John and secures the product. 
* While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially increasing the price. It's a good compromise at this point."
