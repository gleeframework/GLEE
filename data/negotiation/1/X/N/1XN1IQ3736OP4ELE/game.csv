I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and go with $107.50?,107.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $112.50. It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
