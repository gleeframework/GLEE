I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point - it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering Bob with $110. This is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
