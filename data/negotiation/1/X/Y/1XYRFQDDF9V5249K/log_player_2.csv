"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John, so anything less than that is a good deal. Alice's offer of $120 is a decent starting point, but you can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a good deal for me, as it's less than what I'd pay John. It's also a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, giving Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is still a better deal than buying from John for $150. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer again, and I might end up paying more.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the product for a good price."
