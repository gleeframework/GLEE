"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to pay $15,000 for the product. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your budget constraints, however, I know the true value of this product and  $10,000 is  too low. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that $13,000 is a bit high for me. I am willing to increase my offer to $11,000. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I have another buyer willing to pay $12,000.  To make this worthwhile for me, I need to get at least that much. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts, Alice. I am still committed to finding a solution within my budget. Given the situation, I am willing to offer $11,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",11000.0,Bob,6,
