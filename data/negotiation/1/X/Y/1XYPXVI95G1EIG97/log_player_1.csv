Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but not so high that it would immediately scare Bob away. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I'm willing to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but still maintains a profit margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than I initially hoped for, it's a reasonable price and I'm not sure how much higher I can push Bob.  I'm also getting a bit tired of the negotiation and would like to finalize the sale."
