"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's not worth accepting. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my budget than $15,000, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll counter with a lower offer, hoping to find a price we can both agree on."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget. While I could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely she'll go lower than $12,000.  I'm better off buying from John at $10,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget."
