"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we are getting closer. $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
