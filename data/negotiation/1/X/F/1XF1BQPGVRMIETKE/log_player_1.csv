Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but not an outrageous one. This allows room for negotiation without immediately appearing unreasonable. 
* **Confidence:** My message conveys confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to see it as a valuable opportunity.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I haven't set a firm ""bottom line"" in my message, which implies flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **John as Safety Net:** Having John's offer provides a safety net and ensures I'm not pressured into accepting a low price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my negotiation strategy. If he counters, I'll need to gauge his interest level and decide whether to accept his offer, counter with a lower price, or end the negotiation and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept:**  While I initially wanted more, Bob's offer of $800,000 matches the value I place on the product for selling to John. 
* **No further negotiation is necessary:**  There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale.
* **Time is valuable:**  There's no guarantee John won't change his mind, and any delay risks losing both buyers.

**By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a quick sale and a guaranteed return of $800,000, which meets my minimum goal.**"
