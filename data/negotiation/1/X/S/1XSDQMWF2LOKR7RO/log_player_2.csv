Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high at $9,250. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take $9,400.  That's a fair price for both of us.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still holding firm, but $9,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,300.  This would be a good deal for both of us and avoid a long back-and-forth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9300}
```
