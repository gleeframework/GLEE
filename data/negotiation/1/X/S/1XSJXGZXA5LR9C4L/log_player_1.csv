``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the ""fantastic deal"" and ""value"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I leave the door open for further discussion, inviting Bob to respond with either acceptance or a counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* I'll keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's potential for a more favorable counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, but I want to explore the possibility of a better deal with Bob first.

**Next step:** I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm acknowledging his budget concerns and offering a compromise price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, as it's still too low.

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant compromise:** I'm reducing my price by $30,000, showing that I'm serious about reaching a deal but not sacrificing too much.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations are stalled:** The gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price is very small, but Bob seems unwilling to budge further.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Conceding further could lead to a lower price that's too far below my minimum. 
* **John's offer is much better:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of a protracted negotiation.

**Conclusion:** The potential gains from further negotiations with Bob are outweighed by the risk and the opportunity cost of missing John's much better offer."
