"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,700. This is the lowest price I can offer and still ensure I make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to prioritize my own interests as well.",10700.0,Alice,5,
