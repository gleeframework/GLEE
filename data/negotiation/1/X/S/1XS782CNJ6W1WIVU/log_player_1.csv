{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I want to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Initial Offer:** Offering $1,400,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'll be mindful of John's offer as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Counter-Offer:**  I have leverage because I can always sell to John for $1,500,000. This allows me to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000,  keeping in mind John's offer as my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this counter-offer, I'll consider reducing the price slightly more, but I'll still be mindful of John's offer as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,280,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Enough:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Risk of Selling Too Low:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a significant amount of money. 
* **John as Backup:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a better option, even if it means missing out on a potential deal with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000 or slightly higher.  I'll still be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,280,000 is still too far below what I need to sell this product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,315,000? This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1315000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm communicating that this is my final offer. This creates urgency and may encourage Bob to accept.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a compromise, but it's still closer to my previous offer than Bob's.
* **Warning:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options by mentioning other buyers.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll immediately sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,315,000, given John's offer and my own minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $1,315,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,290,000, but no higher. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still below my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is that I might end up accepting a price that's too low and losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement and is significantly higher than Bob's offer.

**Conclusion:**

It's better to be certain of a good deal with John than to risk losing more money by continuing negotiations with Bob."
