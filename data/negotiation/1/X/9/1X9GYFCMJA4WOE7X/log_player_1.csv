Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product today for $150. It's a great deal on something I know you'll love."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Psychology:** Starting with a higher price like $150 leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Value Perception:** The message emphasizes the product's value, hoping to justify the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $50 profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to negotiate down, potentially settling closer to $100.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your minimum price, still making a profit."
