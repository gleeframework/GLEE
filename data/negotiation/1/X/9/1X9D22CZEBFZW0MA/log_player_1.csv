Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a strong opening price that gives me room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe the product is worth more and want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my original offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range.  Accepting this offer will secure a sale for a price significantly higher than selling to John.  I'm taking this deal to avoid risking further negotiation and potential loss of a sale altogether."
