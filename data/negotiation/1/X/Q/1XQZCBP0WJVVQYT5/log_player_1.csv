Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly above her minimum. 
* **Backup Offer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
