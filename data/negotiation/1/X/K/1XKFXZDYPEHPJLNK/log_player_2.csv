Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000.
