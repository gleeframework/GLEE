"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This would give you a healthy profit while also allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. I'm thinking of $975,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $975,000 is still too far off for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $875,000.  This would leave us both with a comfortable profit.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still a bit above your latest offer. I'll go with $925,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my own minimum requirements.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I think I can do $950,000. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,9,
