"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $900,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  You have room to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This would give you a healthy profit while also allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for me. I'm thinking of $975,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price point, $975,000 is still too high. You have a few more rounds to negotiate and can potentially push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and attempt to secure a more favorable deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $975,000 is still too far off for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $875,000.  This would leave us both with a comfortable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still a bit above your latest offer. I'll go with $925,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my own minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, $925,000 is still above your preferred range. You still have a few rounds to negotiate and can potentially secure a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I think I can do $950,000. It's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the 9th round, and Alice's offer is still at $950,000, which is higher than our target. We only have one round left to negotiate, and there is a high chance that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. Buying from John for $1,200,000 ensures we get the product, although at a higher price, rather than risking getting nothing from Alice in the last round."
