Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) than your minimum ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle above your minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000 provides a safety net. You don't *need* to go below that.

**Why this price?**

$9,500 captures a significant portion of the value difference between what Bob is willing to pay and what you're willing to accept. It's a strong starting point that leaves both parties with the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
