"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
