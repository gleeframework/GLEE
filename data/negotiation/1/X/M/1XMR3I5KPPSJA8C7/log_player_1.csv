Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above Bob's perceived value. I'm confident I can get a better deal than John's $1,500,000 offer, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the deal,  it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, showing my willingness to negotiate, but it still leaves room for profit and is closer to my desired value than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to come to the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low.  While his offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better price, or perhaps convince Bob to come up to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $1,550,000. This is my absolute bottom line. It's slightly above my minimum value, but I'm willing to take a small loss to avoid selling to John at the moment. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll go with John's offer as it's the best I can get right now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've made significant concessions, and it seems unlikely that he will meet my price. While I'm disappointed to not get closer to my desired price, selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option right now. It's better than selling to Bob at a lower price and ensures I meet my minimum value."
