"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I understand this is a big difference, but I'm hoping we can find a way to work together.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
