"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. While my initial ask was based on a comprehensive valuation, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000. It's my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've considered your offer carefully, and I need to be upfront.  My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,650,000. I have another buyer ready at that price, but I believe this product would be a great fit for you, and I want to give you the first opportunity. This is my final offer â€“ I need a yes or no.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you giving me this opportunity. While $1,650,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. My absolute maximum I can offer is $1,400,000. This is a significant commitment for me, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
