Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise between my minimum value and Bob's estimated value.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer, but still offering a price lower than my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go any lower than $10,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum, I will choose to sell to him to avoid further negotiation."
