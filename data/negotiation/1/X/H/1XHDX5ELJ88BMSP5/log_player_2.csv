"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her initial value, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  This price still gives you a good value and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above your desired price of $8,000 but it's much closer to your budget than her previous offer of $9,500. Accepting this offer allows you to purchase the product without risking a negotiation breakdown that could potentially lead to having to buy the product from John for the full $8,000."
