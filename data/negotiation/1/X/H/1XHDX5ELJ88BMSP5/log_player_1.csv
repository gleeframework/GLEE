{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting ripped off.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to make concessions if needed. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond.

I'm going to keep an eye on John in case the negotiations with Bob don't go well!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  This price still gives you a good value and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
