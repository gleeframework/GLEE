Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure $985,000 is a fair price for this product, Bob. I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,007,500. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value. What do you think?

Alice is clearly very attached to that $1,000,000 valuation.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower.  Taking her offer at $1,007,500 saves you a significant amount compared to John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
