It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  You can always go to John if you don't reach an agreement."

I'm starting with a lower offer of $700,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate."

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $710,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price. Hopefully, this will lead to a final agreement."
