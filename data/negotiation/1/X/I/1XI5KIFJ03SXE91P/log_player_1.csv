"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm also setting a clear expectation that this product is valuable and I'm confident in its worth. 

By offering this price, I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest level and see if he's willing to engage in serious negotiation. If he rejects, I can analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to accept it right away. Bob's initial low offer indicates he's not fully aware of the product's value. By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I'm not desperate to sell immediately. 

I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that's more in line with my initial expectations, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still staying well above Bob's initial offer. By decreasing the price by a significant amount, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to engage further and potentially come closer to my desired price. This counteroffer allows for a more balanced negotiation, where both parties have room to move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm aware that I have limited rounds left, but I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm determined to get a better deal. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my target. 

I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a smaller adjustment this time, lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a margin for negotiation.  

With only 5 rounds left, it's crucial to move towards a deal, but I'm not ready to accept Bob's current offer.  This counteroffer bridges the gap and gives Bob a realistic price point to consider while still leaving space for further negotiation."
