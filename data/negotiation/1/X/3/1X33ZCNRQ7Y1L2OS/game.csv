"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a valuable product Alice, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we agree on $960,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $960,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from where I see the value.  To make this work, I'd need you to come up to at least $1,025,000.  This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
