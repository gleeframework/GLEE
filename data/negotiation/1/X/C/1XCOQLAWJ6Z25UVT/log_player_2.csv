"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price for a product of this caliber, and I'm willing to be flexible. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

The product is worth more to Alice than it is to me, so there's room for negotiation. I'll reject Alice's initial offer and see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?

I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can negotiate further."

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is still a good deal for me.  While I'd prefer to pay less, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and me having to buy from John for $800,000 isn't worth it.  I'll accept her offer."
