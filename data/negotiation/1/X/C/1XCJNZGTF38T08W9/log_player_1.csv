Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, even if his perceived value is only $80. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start higher, an excessively high price might discourage Bob from even considering the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring the sale."
