"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $130 is still above your ideal price point.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $110.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

$120 is still a good deal for you compared to buying from John, and it's closer to your ideal price. It's a reasonable compromise, and you're likely to save more money by accepting than by continuing to negotiate."
