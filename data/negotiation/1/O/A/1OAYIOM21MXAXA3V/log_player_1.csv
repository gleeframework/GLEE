Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but leaving some room for negotiation.  This gives Bob a good incentive to accept, while still allowing me to get close to the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $130. This is still below Bob's perceived value of $150, but it shows him I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will lead to a quick agreement."
