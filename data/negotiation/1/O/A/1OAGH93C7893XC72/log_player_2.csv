We're getting close, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a little lower.  Alice is signaling that she might not go much lower, but we don't have to jump to John just yet."

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $115, and we only have one round left. Buying from John for $120 is the best option at this point."
