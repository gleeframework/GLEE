Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, given my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I need to continue negotiating to bring the price down further. I'm not willing to pay $900,000, but I'm still interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $850,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer of $850,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $875,000 for the product. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I believe I can push for a lower price, as Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. I want to see if I can get her down to $800,000 or very close to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to push myself to $825,000. This is a significant step closer to your previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product.  Is this a number we can work with?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to push the boundaries, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $850,000 for the product. I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at the $850,000 mark, given our previous discussions. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $850,000, which would be $837,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. We are running out of rounds and there is a risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and then making a higher counteroffer. Therefore, it's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000. I'm confident this is the best option to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget."
