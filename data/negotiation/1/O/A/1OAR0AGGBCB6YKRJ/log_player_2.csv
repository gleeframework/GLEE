Considering its true worth to you, we're offering it at $95. This is a great opportunity to secure a valuable item at a reasonable price. We hope you'll find this offer compelling. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  You can get the product for a slightly higher price ($100) from John, but it's still within your budget."
