# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the unique advantages this product offers.  Could you consider $2,000,000? I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment on your end.
