"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly revealing my own valuation.
* **Open to Discussion:** I want to convey a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on the product's worth. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor High:**  Set a high expectation early on.
2. **Gather Information:** Observe Bob's reaction to understand his position better.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:**  Leave space for negotiation and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting immediately might signal that I'm willing to go even lower, which could leave potential profit on the table. I'll aim to nudge him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the unique advantages this product offers.  Could you consider $2,000,000? I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment on your end."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:** I'm lowering my price significantly to show flexibility and encourage Bob. However, I'm still aiming high above both his offer and my minimum.  
* **Focus on Value:**  The message reiterates the product's unique benefits to justify the price, subtly shifting focus away from ""market value.""
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer seeks a middle ground that's more appealing to Bob while leaving room for further negotiation on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,750,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 represents a significant profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reaching a Limit:**  It's likely that Bob won't go much higher than this, especially since he's already moved closer to my initial offers.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures a good deal without risking the chance of Bob walking away."
