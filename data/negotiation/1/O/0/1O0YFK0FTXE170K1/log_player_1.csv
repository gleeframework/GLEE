Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique nature and your specific interest, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob. Starting at $2,200,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique nature"" and Bob's ""specific interest"" subtly implies high value and justifies the ambitious price tag.
* **Confidence:** The language is positive and confident, emphasizing the product's worth and Bob's potential gain. This can encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his reactions and counter-offers. Remember, your absolute floor is $1,500,000."
