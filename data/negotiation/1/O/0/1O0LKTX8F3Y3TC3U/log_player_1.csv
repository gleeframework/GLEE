Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price that is more than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe this will incentivize Bob to accept the offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further or sell the product to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to risk a bit more time and effort to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $100, which is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully more appealing to Bob.  This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept.  I'm not sure how much more room for negotiation there is, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
