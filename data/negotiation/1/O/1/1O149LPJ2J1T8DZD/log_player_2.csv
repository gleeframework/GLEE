**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,150,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
