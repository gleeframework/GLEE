"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $150 is far above his limit of $80. He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can we meet at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $110 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still above Bob's limit. He should keep negotiating with Alice. He can either make a counteroffer closer to his limit or see if Alice will come down further.  There are still rounds left, and Bob doesn't want to rush into a decision that leaves him paying more than he wants to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I still think $110 is a bit high, I'm willing to meet you at $95. This is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is at least $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $105 is getting closer to his limit, he can still try to negotiate a better price.  He has several rounds left and a backup option in John, so there's no need to rush into accepting a deal that's still above his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $95.  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it's all I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $115. It's still a good deal for you, and it's a price I can live with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $115 is still too high for Bob.  He's already made it clear he can't go above $95.  With only three rounds left and Alice seemingly unwilling to budge much further, Bob should cut his losses and buy the product from John for $80.  This is the best option for him to ensure he gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
