"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I also need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can we meet at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I still think $110 is a bit high, I'm willing to meet you at $95. This is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me is at least $120.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $95.  It's a fair price considering the value to you, and it's all I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $115. It's still a good deal for you, and it's a price I can live with. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,7,
