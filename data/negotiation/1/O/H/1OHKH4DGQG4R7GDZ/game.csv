"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going below $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which is $102.50, but I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $105",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're making a serious effort to get to a price you're comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $102, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",102.0,Alice,7,
