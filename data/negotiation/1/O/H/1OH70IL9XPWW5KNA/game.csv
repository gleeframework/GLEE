"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750. What do you say?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,750 is still too low. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer you the product for $14,500. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $14,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,6,
