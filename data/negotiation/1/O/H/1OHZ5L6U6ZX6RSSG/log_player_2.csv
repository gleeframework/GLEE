"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still above your limit of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  It's also a good idea to see how much Alice is willing to drop in price before you consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and still within my budget.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my desired price. If I don't see a significant drop in the next round, I'll likely consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get a better deal than Alice's last offer. If Alice is serious about selling, she should be willing to come down a bit more. I'm getting closer to my limit, so if she rejects again, I'll seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to go much lower than $1,100,000. However, $1,125,000 is still too high for me. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise before I consider buying from John.  I'm getting close to my limit, but there's still room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a small increase in my offer to $1,110,000.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I want to see if Alice will meet me halfway.  If she rejects again, I'll seriously consider buying from John.  This is a good compromise offer, demonstrating a willingness to reach a deal while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is only a small decrease from her previous offer.  We've gone back and forth several times and it seems we're hitting a stalemate. I've already reached my limit, and I'm not confident Alice will come down further. To avoid risking a complete breakdown in negotiations, I'm going to accept the guaranteed price from John."
