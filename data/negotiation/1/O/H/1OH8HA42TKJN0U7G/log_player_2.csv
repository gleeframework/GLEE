"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, he can likely negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for less than $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $12,000 for the product. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $14,000, but it's still within Bob's budget. By offering a lower price, Bob is trying to get a better deal while still maintaining a good chance of Alice accepting the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a breakdown in the negotiations.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising her price makes accepting her offer the most logical choice in this scenario."
