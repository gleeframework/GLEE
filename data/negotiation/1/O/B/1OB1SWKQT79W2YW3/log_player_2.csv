"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) allows room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and respectful:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable. 
* **Expressing interest:**  Stating that I'm ""interested"" encourages Alice to continue the conversation."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your position. Let's aim for a fair price. How about $125 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice moved closer to my price, which is a good sign. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet her halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. Let's meet in the middle - how about $117?"",
""product_price"": 117
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** By suggesting $117, I'm meeting Alice almost exactly halfway between her last offer ($125) and my previous counteroffer ($110). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Direct and concise:** I'm keeping my message brief and focused on the price negotiation.
* **Continuing positive tone:** I want to maintain a good rapport with Alice to encourage a successful deal."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in smaller increments now, suggesting we're getting closer to a price she's willing to accept. However, I believe there's still a chance to get the price down a little more before I accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice. How about we settle at $120 even?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($2 instead of $5), signaling that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Round number psychology:** Offering a whole number like $120 feels more concrete and appealing, which might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Limited time remaining:**  With fewer rounds left, I need to start moving towards a decision point soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I'll make it $121 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal difference:**  Alice came down by another dollar. At this point, the difference between her offer ($121) and my desired price is quite small.
* **Time constraint:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk missing out on a reasonable deal. 
* **Saving achieved:** I've already negotiated a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. Accepting $121 represents a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
