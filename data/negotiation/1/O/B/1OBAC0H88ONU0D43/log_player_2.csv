"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $90 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation and establishes that we're serious buyers. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still getting close to John's price.  Let's try to push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're splitting the difference from the previous round. This keeps the negotiation moving while signaling that we're aiming for a price closer to our ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $72? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is only willing to go down another $3, and it's not worth the risk of her backing out completely. Accepting at $72 secures us a decent discount compared to John's price."
