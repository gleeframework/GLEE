"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product. Given its features and benefits, I think a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she is stuck on her high price, you can always walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $18,000 is still a long way from your budget. You should counter-offer again and see if you can get closer to a price you're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

We're getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's important to see if Alice is willing to budge further.  This counter-offer keeps the negotiation going while making it clear you're serious about buying but need a significantly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be reasonable too.  $7,000 is too low.  How about $14,000, my final offer. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and $14,000 is still significantly more than you can get the product for from John. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
