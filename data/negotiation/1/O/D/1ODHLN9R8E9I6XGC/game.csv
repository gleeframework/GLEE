"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's valued at over $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price for a product you've indicated is worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, considering the value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a great price and me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we try $10,500?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. Let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to go down to $10,750, which is a significant concession from my last offer.  This would be a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $10,750 is getting close, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $10,600. This would be a fair price for both of us and get us closer to closing this deal.",10600.0,Bob,6,
