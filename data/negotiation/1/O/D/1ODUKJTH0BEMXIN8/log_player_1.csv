Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  A price of $2,000,000 tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. If he accepts, you significantly increase your profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can lower the price, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle and still earning more than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses a confident tone, emphasizing the product's value and fairness of the price, which can influence Bob's perception."
