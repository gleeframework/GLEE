Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $120, our goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate (if he's inclined) and potentially meet a price that's still significantly higher than his perceived value of $80.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below John's guaranteed offer makes it appear like a good deal without sacrificing too much profit."
