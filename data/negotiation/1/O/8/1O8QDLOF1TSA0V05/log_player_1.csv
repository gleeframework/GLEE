{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a strong opening position, allowing for potential negotiation and a good return for me. It also gives me a good starting point to assess Bob's interest level."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from my initial offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $20,000. I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,500 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. There are two rounds left, and I'd like to see if I can push for a slightly higher price. It's a risk, but I'm hoping to get as close to my desired value as possible."

```

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough situation. While $16,000 is above my minimum, it's still below what I hoped for.  I only have one round left, and with Bob's continued resistance, I don't see a realistic chance of getting a better price. To avoid losing any further time and potential for a lower offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
