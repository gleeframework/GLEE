"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full minimum ($120) to avoid immediate rejection. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive and friendly message can make Bob more open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to Maximize Profit:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I can likely get a better price by counteroffering.
* **John is a Backup:**  Having John as an alternative keeps me from settling too quickly for a low price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $110. Would you be open to meeting in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer within Range:** I'm aiming for a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** By suggesting ""meeting in the middle"" I leave room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $107.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **More Negotiation Room:**  I can still counter-offer and try to get closer to my target price. 
* **John is a Safe Option:**  If the negotiation fails, selling to John ensures I get my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $107.50 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we meet at $112.50? That's a reasonable compromise for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer within Range:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a fair solution.
* **Positive Tone:** Keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging can help Bob stay open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $107.50 and $112.50, which would be $110. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** We're running out of rounds, and the gap is narrowing, so I need to be careful about accepting a price that's too low.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  If the negotiation fails, selling to John ensures I get my minimum."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate you working with me. $110 is getting very close, but it's still a little below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Would you be willing to go up just a bit more, to $111.50?  This would be a small compromise on both our sides and get us closer to closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 111.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the offer by a small amount, showing I'm willing to compromise but not settling for too low a price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm framing my offer as a small compromise to encourage Bob to see it as reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone can help keep Bob open to negotiation.
* **Closing the Deal:**  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I need to push for a final deal that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $111.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $111.50, which would be $110.75. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Losing Out:**  We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer, while getting closer, is still below my minimum price.  There's a high risk that we won't reach a deal within the remaining rounds. 
* **John is a Safe Option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose out on the deal.
* **Minimizing Potential Loss:**  Trying to negotiate further could result in a price even lower than $110.75, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
