"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. With its exceptional features and quality, it's truly a valuable asset for anyone looking to enhance their experience. I understand its worth to you is around $80, but considering its value to me, I propose we strike a deal at $120.

Let's make this transaction happen!
