""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize profit, you need a price closer to Bob's valuation while leaving him room for a perceived ""good deal.""

Offering the product at $950,000:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  It's significantly less than his perceived value, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Profitable for You:** It's substantially more than your minimum acceptable price, securing a significant profit.

**The 24-hour limit:** This creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly rather than risk losing the opportunity."
