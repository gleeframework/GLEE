Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your absolute minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will tell you a lot about how eager he is to buy and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
