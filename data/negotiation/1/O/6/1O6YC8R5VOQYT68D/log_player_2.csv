"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you, given that the product is worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  Bob can get the product for $800,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best financial decision."
