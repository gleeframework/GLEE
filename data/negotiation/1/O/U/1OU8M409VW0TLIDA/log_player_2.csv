**Reasoning:**

While Alice didn't meet my ideal price, this is a good offer for several reasons:

* **Significant Savings:**  $1,015,000 is well below my maximum budget and a savings of $485,000 from John's price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has consistently come down in price, indicating a willingness to make a deal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Alice is signaling she might walk away if I push too hard, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from her at a reasonable price."
