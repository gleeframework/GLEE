"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love!  I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested but I can only do $85 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise closer to my desired price point.  I still have 8 rounds to work with, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for both of us, so let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be, but I can do $90.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm not yet in a desperate position to sell at this price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate and a guaranteed sale for $150 with John. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
