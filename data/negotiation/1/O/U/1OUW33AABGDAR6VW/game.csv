"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm prepared to offer $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer $12500?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $12000.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
