"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your budget.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is closer to your maximum budget, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is within your budget, and while it's not your ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product within your budget."
