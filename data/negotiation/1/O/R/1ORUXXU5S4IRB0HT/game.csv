"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product presents a great opportunity, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,000,000. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from the initial offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
