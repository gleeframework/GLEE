"Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,000?  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,
