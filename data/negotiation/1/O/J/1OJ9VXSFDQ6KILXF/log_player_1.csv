Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  I believe $1,800,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is now getting too low for me.  Although John is only offering my minimum price, it's time to cut my losses and move on."
