"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $2,000,000 represents its true value, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $1,700,000 is a bit too low, but to show I'm serious about making this work, I can do $1,825,000. This is my final offer.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,750,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
