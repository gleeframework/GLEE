"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still higher than the price John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for $1,200,000, saving $200,000."
