"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in your product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price but keep it above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product for $13,250.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000.  This is the absolute most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. Since I only have 10 rounds to close the deal, I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $13,000.  This is a better deal than selling to John for $15,000 because I can still get the deal done within the allotted rounds."
