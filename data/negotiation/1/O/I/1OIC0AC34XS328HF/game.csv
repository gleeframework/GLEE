"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about $120? That's the absolute highest I can go.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is your absolute highest, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $120, so I'll sell the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,7,
