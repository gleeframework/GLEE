# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be happy to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to you. Let me know if this works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and still within your budget. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a lower price in the next round, so accepting is the best option."
