Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not ready to settle for $1,200,000 yet, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob.  I believe I can get a better price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the current market conditions and the value I place on your product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm not sure how much more I can push him. It's better to secure a deal at this price than risk a lower offer or going to John, who will only pay $1,000,000."
