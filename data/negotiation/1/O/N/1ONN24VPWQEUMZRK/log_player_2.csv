Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob has more leverage by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price."

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice has met Bob's counteroffer, and any further negotiation risks losing the deal.  The price of $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  There's no guarantee that Alice would lower her price further, and buying from John would be a worse deal."
