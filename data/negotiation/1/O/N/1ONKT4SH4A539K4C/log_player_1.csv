"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount for me, but still leaves some room for negotiation for Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get a higher price if I continue negotiating.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800.  This is only slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.  However, it's still above my minimum price of $8,000.  I want to see if I can get Bob to meet me closer to my desired price before I start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping to get a little closer to $10,000,  $9,600 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm happy with this outcome!"
