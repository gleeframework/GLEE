Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** While brief, mentioning that you know the product is valuable to Bob attempts to frame the price as justified. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 gives you a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
