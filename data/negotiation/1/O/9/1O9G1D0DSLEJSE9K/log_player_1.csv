"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, encouraging him to participate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value of $100.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is tempting, I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $95? That leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on a win-win situation.
* **Motivation:**  The message subtly implies that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, I'm confident that I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in Round 5, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. However, I'm keeping a close eye on the number of rounds remaining and the possibility of selling to John if negotiations continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value our back and forth, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $92.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm reducing my offer slightly more, but I'm still trying to get a price that's close to my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing this offer as a ""fair"" price that benefits both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm putting a bit more pressure on Bob to reach a deal.  

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $92. I'd be willing to pay $87 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $87 is only $3 away from my minimum, but I'm running out of time.
* **Risk of Losing Time:** If I continue negotiating, I risk going through more rounds and potentially getting a lower offer.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer of $100 is guaranteed and significantly higher than Bob's offer. 

With only 4 rounds left, it's better to take the sure thing and sell to John."
