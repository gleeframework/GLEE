"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it from you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $1,400,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1,550,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it from you.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
