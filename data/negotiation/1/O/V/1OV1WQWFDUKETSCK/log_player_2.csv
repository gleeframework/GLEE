"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value ($1,300,000 vs. $1,200,000).** This means Alice is willing to make a profit, but not a huge one.
* **John's price is your maximum ($1,500,000).**  You can always fall back on John.
* **By rejecting, you put pressure on Alice.**  She might counter-offer with a lower price to avoid losing the deal entirely.

**Strategy:** Rejecting Alice's offer creates a negotiation opportunity. You might be able to get a lower price from Alice."
