Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to let it go for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $100, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $150, so he's likely to see $125 as a good deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It gets straight to the point and doesn't leave room for confusion. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is above your minimum and a good deal for Bob, you can likely get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  It's a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** You're not giving in too quickly.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** You're showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's a fair price:**  $120 is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you have a couple of things to consider:

* **$118 is only $2 away from your previous counteroffer:**  It's not a huge difference, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **John is only offering $100:**  Even if you reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, you might end up with a lower price than Bob's current offer. 

Therefore, it's a good strategy to accept Bob's offer of $118. It's a solid price, and you're likely to get more money than you would by selling to John."
