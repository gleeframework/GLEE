Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A lower starting price encourages Bob to engage in negotiation rather than immediately rejecting.

By starting with a moderate offer, you open the door for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you are willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undercuts your desired profit.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** By pointing out that $10,500 is still a great deal for him, it encourages him to consider your offer.
* **Splitting the difference:** This often feels like a fair compromise and can be a good tactic to break an impasse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $9,500 is only $500 below your minimum price, making it a reasonable deal considering the potential for further negotiation.
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  Bob seems firm on his budget, and further negotiation may lead to a stalemate.  It's better to secure the sale at this price than risk losing him and ending up selling to John for less. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though this sale is slightly below your ideal profit, building a good relationship with Bob could lead to future transactions where you can potentially get a better price."
