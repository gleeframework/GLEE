"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, however,  the value of this product is substantial and $950,000 falls significantly short of what I believe it's worth.  How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I'd need to see some flexibility from you. Can we discuss further?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to continue this negotiation.  While I see you're trying to reach a number that works for you, the value of this product is firmly above $1 million.  I could consider $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's a very fair price considering the potential this product holds.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
