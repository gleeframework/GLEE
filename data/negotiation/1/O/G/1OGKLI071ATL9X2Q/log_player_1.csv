{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. My asking price is $1,190,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,190,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to start a dialogue, encouraging Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer, allowing Alice to gauge his interest and adjust if needed."
