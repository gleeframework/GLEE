"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000.  This is a considerable compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this valuable product in your hands.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from what I consider acceptable. Let's settle this right now: $975,000 and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $975,000 is still beyond my budget. If you're willing to come down to $800,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
