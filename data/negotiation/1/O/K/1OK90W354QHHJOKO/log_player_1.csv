Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
