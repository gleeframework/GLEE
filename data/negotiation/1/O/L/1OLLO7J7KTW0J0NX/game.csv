"I understand you have a strong interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1150000. This is my final counteroffer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
