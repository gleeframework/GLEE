Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering your offer of $9,250, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $8,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget, even if it means missing out on potentially getting a better deal with Alice."
