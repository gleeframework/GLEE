"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Could you do $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $13,500. Can we meet at $14,000 is too high, but $13,500 feels more reasonable?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000? This product is really worth it, and I think that's more than fair.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $15,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle of that and $14,000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
