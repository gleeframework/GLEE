Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to earn as much as possible, so I'm starting high. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. This allows me to take a risk without losing money. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, giving us the opportunity to negotiate a price that is beneficial to both parties.

**Important Note:** This is just my initial offer. I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
