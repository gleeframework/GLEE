Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also frames the offer as a good deal for Bob, which might increase the chances of him accepting."
