"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $12,000.  There's room for negotiation. 
* **You have time:** You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to negotiate. 
* **John's price is your fallback:**  If the negotiation doesn't work out, you have a backup option at $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your cost and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's a slight reduction from her previous offer, it's still well above what the product is worth to her.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We've only had 3 rounds, and there's still time to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is still a backup:** You can still buy from John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm still interested, but $12,500 is still too high. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still a good deal for you compared to the $15000 you mentioned earlier. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's a slight reduction from her previous offer, it's still closer to her desired price than a reasonable compromise.
* **We're approaching the midpoint:** The offer is getting closer to your ideal price, and there's still potential to get a better deal with a few more rounds.
* **John's price is still a viable alternative:** You can still buy from John for $15,000, so you have the flexibility to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""We're getting closer, but $13,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go below $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still significantly higher than your ideal price. You're getting closer, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds remaining, you need to be cautious about making a decision that could leave you with a suboptimal price.
* **John's offer is still a better alternative:** You can always buy from John for $15,000, which is closer to your desired price than Alice's offer.

**Counter-Offer Strategy:**  Since we're nearing the end, it's worth trying to bridge the gap with a significant counteroffer.  However, be prepared to potentially walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a price in mind, but I'm firm on $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll need to consider other options.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bold Move:** We're close to the end, and it's time to push for a better deal.  This counteroffer is close to what Alice might be willing to accept, while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Finality:** By stating it's your final offer, you put pressure on Alice to make a decision.  
* **Backup Plan:** You've already mentioned buying from John, reminding Alice of your alternatives. 

This approach is a gamble, but it could pay off by pushing Alice closer to your desired price. If she rejects, you can still choose to buy from John."
