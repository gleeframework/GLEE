Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do it for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more than that to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.
