"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $10,000?  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more than that to you. Let's meet in the middle.
