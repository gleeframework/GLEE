"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to subtly justify the high asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind the standing offer from John ($800,000). While the goal is to maximize profit, be prepared to walk away if negotiations with Bob stagnate significantly below a reasonable level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both our target price and the product's value to him ($1,200,000). We have room to negotiate and aim for a better outcome. 

We'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to bridge the gap and keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective, but I believe $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects a compromise that acknowledges both our positions."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer signals a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's ""true potential,"" anchoring the value in his mind.
* **Positive Tone:**  We maintain a collaborative and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and settle at $987,500? This reflects a significant compromise from both of us and could be a win-win.  Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to anchor the price lower with each offer. While $987,500 is getting closer to an acceptable range, we are still early in the negotiation (only round 4 out of 10). There's room to push back a bit further and aim for a higher price, especially since the product is worth significantly more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,010,000. This represents a significant concession on my part while ensuring a fair deal for both sides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  This counteroffer makes a smaller concession ($15,000) than Bob's previous move, signaling that we are getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message highlights the concept of a ""fair deal"" to nudge Bob towards a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Maintaining Dialogue:** The tone remains positive and encouraging, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation."
