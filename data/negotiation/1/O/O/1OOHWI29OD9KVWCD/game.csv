"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price is more reasonable and still reflects the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $975,000? I think that's a fair offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
