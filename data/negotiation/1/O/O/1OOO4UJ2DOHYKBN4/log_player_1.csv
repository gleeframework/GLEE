Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about we set the product price at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns closely with the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $12,000,  Bob's offer of $10,000 is reasonable and meets my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer is the best option for maximizing my profit in this situation."
