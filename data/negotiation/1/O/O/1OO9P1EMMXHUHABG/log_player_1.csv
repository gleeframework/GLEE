Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'll counter with a lower price, but still within my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget, I'm still looking to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. I'd like to counter with an offer of $960,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is getting closer to my minimum.  At this point, with the time constraint and the risk of having to sell to John for less, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer."
