"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? This price still gives you a good deal, considering the product is worth $8,000 to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $8,250 is a compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product if we can meet at this price.",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think!",8000.0,Alice,5,
