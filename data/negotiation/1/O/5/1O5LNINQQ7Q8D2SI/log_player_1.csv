"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will receive. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** By setting a price above Bob's value, I encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation Continues:** Rejecting allows the negotiation to continue. I can use this opportunity to counter with a higher offer, hopefully finding a middle ground. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John is a safe option, I'm not yet willing to give up on negotiating with Bob. There's still potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $90?  It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($80). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** $90 is still above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to see the value of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think we can do even better. How about $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is getting closer to my desired price point, but I'm not yet ready to concede. There's still room to negotiate further.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is a safe option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. There's still potential to get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle at $90. It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiteration of Compromise:** I'm repeating my previous offer of $90, which is a good compromise and shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:** I'm highlighting the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency by saying ""Let's make this happen!"". This could encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $90, but I'm willing to compromise at $87. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation is Stalling:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's not yet acceptable. The negotiation seems to be stalled, and continuing might not lead to a better result.
* **John's Offer:** Since we are nearing the end of the rounds (only 4 rounds left), John's offer becomes more appealing. It's a sure thing, and it guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not able to go lower than $90. This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** I'm sticking with my last offer of $90.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about my minimum price.
* **Warning of Alternatives:** I'm subtly warning Bob that I might sell to John if he doesn't agree. This adds pressure to close the deal.
* **No More Concessions:**  There's only a small gap between our offers now. I'm not willing to concede further."
