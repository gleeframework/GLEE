Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our desired profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the security of John as a backup buyer, so we're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely."
