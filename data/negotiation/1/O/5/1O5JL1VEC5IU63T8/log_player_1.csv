"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,200,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is far too low. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This offer takes into account the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now negotiating more realistically, but his offer is still significantly below my minimum. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push him closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the product's worth. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and considers your budget constraints while ensuring a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still a substantial difference from my $1,500,000 minimum and John's guaranteed offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see significant movement from Bob to justify not selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and recognize the value of this product. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,450,000. This price reflects the very bottom line for me and ensures a fair deal for both of us. "",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm presenting this as my ""final offer"" to encourage Bob to seriously consider it.  It's a strong compromise, significantly lower than my initial ask, yet still above both his offer and my guaranteed sale to John. This approach aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're getting close.  To seal the deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part and reflects a price I'm confident is fair for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my $1,500,000 minimum.  His counteroffer of $1,400,000 is close, but I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price.  It's time to cut off negotiations with Bob and solidify the deal with John to avoid further risk or wasted time."
