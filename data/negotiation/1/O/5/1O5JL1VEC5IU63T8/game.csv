,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,200,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This offer takes into account the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the product's worth. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and considers your budget constraints while ensuring a fair deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
