Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 sets a strong floor.  Aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale price allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to either meet in the middle or hold firm knowing you have John as a backup. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the price without explicitly stating its worth to you.  This approach seeks to influence Bob's perception of the product's value."
