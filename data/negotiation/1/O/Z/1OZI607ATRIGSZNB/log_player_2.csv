Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate after your previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $12,625, but I'm not going any higher. This is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's final offer is still above his target price of $12,000. While he could make one final counteroffer, it's risky.  He has a guaranteed deal with John at his desired price, so it's the best option to secure the product."
