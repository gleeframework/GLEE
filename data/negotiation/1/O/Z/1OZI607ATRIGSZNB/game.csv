,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $12,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraint, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. This is the lowest price I can consider at this point. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $13,000.  This would be a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is still a bit too high.  How about $12,750?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to meet you at $12,900, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",12900.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're feeling the pressure, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  Let's make this final offer: $12,500.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. This is my final offer, let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,8,
