Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good deal, I can potentially get more from him, and I'm not yet ready to settle for the minimum I'd get from John.  I want to see if I can push him higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal. I have a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can push him closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 still feels a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,075,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I have a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a slightly better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 one last time. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $1,085,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 8, meaning we only have 2 rounds left to reach an agreement. Bob is offering $1,085,000, which is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. However, with only 2 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. I could end up with nothing. 

Given the limited time, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed deal, and while it's not my ideal price, it's better than risking a stalemate with Bob."
