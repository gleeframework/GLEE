Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the message emphasizes the product's worth and the ""exclusive opportunity.""
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances securing a good deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
