**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice is offering a discount, the price is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can purchase the product from John for $15,000, which is still within his budget. This strategy saves Bob $2,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
