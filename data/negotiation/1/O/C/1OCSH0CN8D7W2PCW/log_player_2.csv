"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product brings to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

It's not worth haggling with Alice further. She's unlikely to go below $13,000 and you can get the product for $12,000 from John."
