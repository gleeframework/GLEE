"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while also showing him that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $12,000. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my floor price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is above my minimum price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a fair deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
