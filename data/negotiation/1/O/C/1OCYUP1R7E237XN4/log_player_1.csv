Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value. Highlighting the ""value"" without specifics allows Bob to justify the price based on his own assessment.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message encourages a response and potential counter-offer from Bob, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.

**Important Note:** While aiming high is a good strategy, be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's reaction and any information you gather during your interaction."
