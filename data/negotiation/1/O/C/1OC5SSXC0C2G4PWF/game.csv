"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  While I value the product, I'm only comfortable paying $13,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13,500 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $14,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to secure the product for $13,750.  It's a fair price that's a reasonable compromise.  What do you think?",13750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $13,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm willing to come down just a little further to $13,900.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",13900.0,Alice,5,
