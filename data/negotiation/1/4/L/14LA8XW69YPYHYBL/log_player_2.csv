"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to get the product for under $800,000. 
* Alice's offer is above your target, so rejecting is the logical first step. 
* You'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a bold counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes my strong desire to get a good deal. 
*  While $750,000 is still above my ideal price, it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price lower than $800,000.
*  Rejecting this offer gives me a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal. 
*  It's still early in the negotiation, and I have rounds left to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm proposing my final price, which is my target price of $800,000. 
*  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance she will accept this offer. 
* If she rejects it, I'll have to decide whether to accept her next offer or buy from John at the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $820,000 is slightly better than my target price, but not significantly better.
* I've already made my final offer, and there's a risk of Alice rejecting it again. 
*  Given that I have the option to buy from John at my target price, it's wiser to take that option now and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
