"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it could bring to my business.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, however,  $1,500,000 undervalues its true potential. I'd be willing to part with it for $1,700,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is a price I believe we can both agree is fair.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while also being reasonable for you.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  How about we settle this right now for $1,625,000?  This slight adjustment ensures we both walk away feeling good about the deal.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,625,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
