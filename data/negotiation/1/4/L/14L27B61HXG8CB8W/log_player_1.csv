"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, framing it around the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" plants the seed in Bob's mind that this is more than just a $1,000,000 asset to him. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to make a deal at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is a significant profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's message indicates strong interest, suggesting there's room to push for a higher price before accepting or walking away to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, however,  $1,500,000 undervalues its true potential. I'd be willing to part with it for $1,700,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is a price I believe we can both agree is fair."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We're coming down from the initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** The $1,700,000 price point keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum, aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Reframing Value:**  Instead of solely focusing on the price reduction, the message emphasizes the product's value proposition to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while also being reasonable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and using a splitting-the-difference tactic, which often signals they are getting closer to their upper limit. We are still in a strong position with John as a backup, so we can afford to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  How about we settle this right now for $1,625,000?  This slight adjustment ensures we both walk away feeling good about the deal."",
""product_price"": 1625000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This counteroffer meets Bob exactly halfway between the previous two offers, signaling strong movement toward a deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrases like ""settle this right now""  inject a bit of urgency without being overly aggressive.  
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting that this deal is a win-win for both parties helps solidify Bob's willingness to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,625,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's becoming less likely that squeezing for another $25,000 or $50,000 is worth the risk of him walking away.
* **Solid Profit:** $1,575,000 is a very strong profit margin, exceeding our minimum by over 50%. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows us to utilize the funds sooner rather than later."
