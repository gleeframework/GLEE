"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This is to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic thinking:**  By starting high, I hope to secure a higher final price if Bob is truly interested.  I'm also setting the stage for potential counteroffers that will bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Risk assessment:** While this strategy risks losing Bob entirely, it's also the most likely way to maximize my potential earnings. I can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm confident the product is worth more. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's low offer signals that there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get him to increase his offer.
* **Time is on my side:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate without risking a loss if I ultimately choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** I'm reducing my price from the initial $1,500,000 to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price that is significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Signaling compromise:**  By lowering my price, I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate. This should encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while ensuring I don't undervalue the product. I still have a cushion to work with if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. It's a good compromise that secures a decent profit.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could try for a slightly higher price,  further negotiation risks losing Bob altogether. I don't want to risk selling to John for $1,000,000 when a deal with Bob is within reach.
* **Time factor:** With six rounds remaining, I have a good chance of finding a better buyer in the future. However, accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
