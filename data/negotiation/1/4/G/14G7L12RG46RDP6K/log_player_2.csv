"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, potentially even exceeding $1000000.  While I can't divulge specific details without a signed NDA, I can assure you this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a substantial discount from its true worth, but I believe in the potential of our partnership.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims the product is worth more, you have no way to verify that.  It's better to reject her offer and purchase the product from John for your maximum acceptable price."
