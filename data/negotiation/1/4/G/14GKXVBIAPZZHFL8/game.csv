"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  I'm willing to close the deal right now at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $12,800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12800.0,Alice,5,
