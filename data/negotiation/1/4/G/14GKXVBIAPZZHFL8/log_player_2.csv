"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000. While it's closer than her initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she rejected Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $12,500?  I'm willing to close the deal right now at that price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $12,800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,800 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob has already rejected Alice's previous offers and is unlikely to get a better deal from her.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John at $12,000.  This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and saves money."
