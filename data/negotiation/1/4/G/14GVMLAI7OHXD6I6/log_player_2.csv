"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $10,000, and John is offering the product at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product immediately from John without any risk of a higher price or a longer negotiation."
