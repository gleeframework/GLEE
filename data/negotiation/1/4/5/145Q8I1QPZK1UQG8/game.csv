I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. Is that something you'd be interested in?,9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I was thinking more along the lines of a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking of $8500. Would that work for you?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $8500 is the best price for this product. I'd be willing to meet you at $7500. Can you consider that?,7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $8200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think I've been too generous with my offers so far. I'd be willing to meet you at $7000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal",7000.0,Bob,6,
