"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product. I could consider a price of $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure you get this valuable product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
