"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point given Bob values the product at $120. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using positive language (""great deal"", ""appreciate its value"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm ending with a question to prompt Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and it doesn't leave me much profit.
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate with Bob. There's a good chance I can get him to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John now would be a missed opportunity. I can likely get a better price through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value proposition by emphasizing that it's still a great deal for him. 
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language (""great deal"") to maintain a friendly and collaborative tone. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to make sure I can afford it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm only making a $5 profit, which isn't much considering the value of the product to me. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John for $80 would mean essentially giving away the product at a loss. I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $87.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think?"", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Fairness and finality:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and suggesting it's a good opportunity to finalize the deal. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm using an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $87 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. I really like the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Limited time:** We're at round 6, and only have 4 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John for $80 would mean a very small profit. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a $2 profit, which is better than nothing. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, it's important to recognize the realities of the negotiation and secure a deal before time runs out."
