"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $90, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  This gives us both a fair price, and we can close the deal.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $87.50 is still a bit high. How about we try $82.50?",82.5,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $85? It's a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's close the deal.",85.0,Alice,7,
