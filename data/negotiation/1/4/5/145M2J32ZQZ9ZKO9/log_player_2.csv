"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm starting the offer at $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's wise to reject and start counter-negotiating to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting my counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This shows my willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear lower boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $12,500 is still higher than my preferred price point and closer to John's offer. I'll continue to negotiate to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is my final offer, as it's what I'm comfortable paying.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm now pushing for my maximum budget, making it clear that this is my final offer.  By referencing John's price, I'm subtly reminding Alice that she has a competitor. This approach is designed to push Alice towards acceptance."
