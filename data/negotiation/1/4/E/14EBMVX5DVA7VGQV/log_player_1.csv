Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Goal:** Maximize profit. I want to earn as much as possible.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **My Floor:** My absolute minimum is $1,000,000 (John's offer). 
* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting high, but not unreasonably so.  $1,200,000 is a significant profit for me, but still within the realm of possibility for Bob, considering his value.
* **Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below my minimum.  I'll consider Bob's counteroffers and aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Goal:** Maximize profit.  
* **Bob's Offer:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute floor.
* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap. I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Goal:**  Maximize profit, but I also want to avoid losing the deal.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my floor, but it's closer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that John is waiting to buy at $1,000,000, but I'm trying to get a bit more if possible.
* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that significantly undercuts my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Goal:**  Maximize profit. 
* **Bob's Offer:** $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is waiting to buy at $1,000,000, which is my absolute floor.
* **Risk/Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk is that he will continue to reject my offers. There's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement, and the longer it takes, the less time I have to get a better deal. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because his offer is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirement. There's no point in risking a lower price with Bob when I have a secure buyer ready to pay my minimum."
