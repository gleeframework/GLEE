Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a rare opportunity to own a piece of something truly special.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Motivational Message:**  I'm using a positive and persuasive message to try to pique Bob's interest and make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John gives me the confidence to push for a higher price with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and any counteroffers he might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since I have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, I show a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product again to remind Bob of its worth and justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on the benefits of the deal for Bob, making it seem like a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $960000. This price allows me to secure the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would love to get closer to $975,000, Bob's counteroffer of $960,000 is very close. This is a significant improvement over John's offer of $800,000.  Given the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or Bob walking away altogether, accepting his offer is the most strategic move at this point."
