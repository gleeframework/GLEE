"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me is $800,000, I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This still allows you to gain a significant profit while ensuring I get the best deal possible.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our potential partnership, I can't accept $850,000. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still offers you a good deal while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's true value. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. However, given my valuation and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose a price of $900,000, which is closer to your initial offer but still within my budget. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and lead to a mutually beneficial transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,
