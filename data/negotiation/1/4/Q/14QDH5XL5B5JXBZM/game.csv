"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my target price. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product while ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair price for both of us.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,110,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal with a mutually beneficial price.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
