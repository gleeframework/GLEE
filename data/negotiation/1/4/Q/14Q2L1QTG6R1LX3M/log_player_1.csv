"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Building rapport:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to establish a positive tone.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is not unreasonable, leaving room for negotiation and potentially finding a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try and squeeze a little more out of the negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a slightly better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $150 is a little too low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $162.50? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 162.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to see the value in the product. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate it. Let's try $155 instead. It's still within my budget and a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $155 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely.  Since we're in round 4, it's better to secure a sale now than risk losing the deal altogether.  I'm also getting closer to John's offer of $150, so I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
