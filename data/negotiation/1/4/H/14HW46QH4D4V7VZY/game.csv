"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, I'm still not quite there. $850000 is very close, but I need to stay above $900000. How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. This is my final offer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
