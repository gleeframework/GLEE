"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm confident this is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $10,000. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to accept. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further. I have 6 rounds left and I'm not in a rush to settle for a price below my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500 again. Can you meet me halfway at $9,062.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,062.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $9,062.50 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better deal. I still have four rounds left and selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price point, but $9,062.50 is still a bit low for me. To meet in the middle, how about $9,150? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500 again. Can you meet me halfway at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at Round 8, and Bob is still stuck at $9,000.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not confident that Bob will budge any further.  With only two rounds left, the risk of a stalemate is high. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
