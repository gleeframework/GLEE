"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $11,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, so I'd like to make an offer of $11,000. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
