"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$120 is too high.** You're aiming for a price under $150, and this is a good starting point to negotiate down. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.**  By rejecting, you show Alice you're serious about getting a better deal and open the door for counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $110? This gives us both a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$110 is within your budget.**  You're aiming to spend under $150, and this price works.
* **Alice is showing flexibility.**  She's moved closer to your price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's a good deal for you.** While you might be able to get it a little lower, it's not worth risking the deal for a few dollars."
