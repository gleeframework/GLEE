"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $175, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob ($100), but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Building rapport:** I'm starting with a friendly message to try and build rapport with Bob and make him feel valued. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This price gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but hopefully, it will entice Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price from Bob in further rounds.
* **Time is limited:** I only have 10 rounds to close the deal, and it's better to secure a sale now than risk losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
