"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with the maximum price I'm willing to accept, as I know John is willing to pay that. This sets a clear baseline and allows me to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll reject it and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum desired price. This shows flexibility while still holding firm on getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping for a more substantial increase in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $900,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is his maximum, and I've already rejected offers that are closer to my minimum.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that we'll run out of rounds and I'll be forced to sell at a price lower than I want. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum."
