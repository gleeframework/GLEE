"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth significantly more to me than Bob. I'm hoping to leverage my position and potentially get close to my target price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my target price, I'm still determined to try and squeeze out more value. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm not willing to settle for $1,300,000 yet. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe $1,600,000 is a fair price considering my value for the product and Bob's willingness to pay. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is clearly trying to drive down the price. I'm not willing to go that low yet. While the deal with John is tempting, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm dropping my price to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and the price John is offering.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll go with John's offer, as I'm not willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much, and I've already reached my bottom line.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed deal with John. I'm confident I'll still be able to get a good price, and I'm not willing to risk losing any more time or money in this negotiation."
