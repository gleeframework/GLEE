"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000 for it.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount of $500 from my initial price, bringing it down to $10,000. This is my best price for now.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer you $7,500. I think that's a fair price and would be a good deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $9,000, which is $1,000 below my initial offer. This is as low as I can go.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down to $9,000.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  I'd be willing to pay $8,250.",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not sure I can split the difference quite that far. I can offer you a price of $9,250, which is a compromise between our last two offers. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  That's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",8750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,750. I can offer you a price of $9,000, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",9000.0,Alice,9,
