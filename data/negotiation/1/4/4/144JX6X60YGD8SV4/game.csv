"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While I believe the product is valuable, $16,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $14,000?  That's a significant discount from my original offer and reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm still feeling a bit stuck at $14,000. Would you be open to meeting halfway at $13,000? That would help me feel more comfortable closing the deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
