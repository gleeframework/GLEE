Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
