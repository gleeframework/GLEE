Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $140 is higher than Bob's valuation of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $140 is above your minimum of $150, ensuring you're not selling at a loss.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, but it also shows you're confident in the product's value.

This offer leaves the door open for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his counteroffer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to $140 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is just a little too low for me.  How about $135?  That's a good compromise, and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  Showing you're willing to negotiate, but not giving in completely.
* **It's lower than your previous offer:**  Demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  Ensuring you're not selling at a loss.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving and may encourage Bob to accept your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $130 again. I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stubbornly insisted on $130, and it's clear that further negotiation won't likely lead to a higher price.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees you your desired profit margin and avoids the risk of continuing a potentially fruitless negotiation."
