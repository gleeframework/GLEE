"Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate the value you see in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers immense value, and I believe a price of $13,200 is fair for both of us. What do you say?",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,200 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,800, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12800.0,Bob,4,
