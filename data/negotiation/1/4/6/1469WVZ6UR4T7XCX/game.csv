"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150.  That's my absolute limit, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $150 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for this product. I'm willing to give you a small discount and offer it to you for $152. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",152.0,Alice,5,
