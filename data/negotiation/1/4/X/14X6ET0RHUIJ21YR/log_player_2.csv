"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's fair to propose a price of $11000 for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows he's serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $10800 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is closer to Bob's desired price point and within his budget.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice might not budge much more.  Accepting the offer now ensures a purchase at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a dead end or having to buy from John at a higher price."
