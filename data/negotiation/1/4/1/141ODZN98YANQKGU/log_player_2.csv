"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90.
* You can get it from John for $100. 

Since you can get the product for the same price from John, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy it from John."
