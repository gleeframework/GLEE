"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $11,500? That gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a fair profit.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
