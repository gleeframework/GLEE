"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to get a better deal, so rejecting the offer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I sell the product for $107? This is my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107 is within your budget and represents a good compromise. You've successfully negotiated a lower price than her initial offer.  While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and ending the negotiations. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher price."
