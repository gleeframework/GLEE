"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob, but there's still room to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price point you've suggested. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,050,000 is a better price than $1,100,000, he can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  Alice is already willing to compromise, so there's potential to get closer to his desired price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $950,000 offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000 for the product. This is a compromise that gets closer to your target price while still recognizing the value I've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and further negotiation might not yield much more savings.  At this point, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
