{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($100) and slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing enthusiasm to pique Bob's interest and potentially make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, and I'm ready to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll need to decide whether to: 

* **Accept a Counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum price of $100, I might accept to secure a sale.
* **Make a Counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my price, I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Sell to John:** If the negotiations with Bob become too drawn-out or if his counteroffers are consistently too low, I'll sell to John to secure the $100 guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum price of $100. Accepting it would be a loss for me. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price, potentially bridging the gap. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $100 gives me the confidence to negotiate with Bob without settling for a significantly lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a price that's acceptable to both of us. I'll need to consider:

* **How much am I willing to compromise?** I'll need to determine how much lower than my ideal price I'm willing to go to secure a sale. 
* **Bob's potential to counter:** I'll need to anticipate whether Bob will counter my offer again, and be prepared to negotiate further if necessary.
* **The risk of losing the sale:** If I'm not careful, I might lose the sale to Bob or to John if the negotiation takes too long."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a compromise. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint compromise:** I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my minimum of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows a willingness to negotiate and could potentially be attractive to Bob.
* **Focus on the deal:**  I'm framing it as a ""good deal"" for Bob to highlight the value he'll be getting at that price.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  I'm not immediately going down to $100, but I'm open to further discussion to reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! We have a deal.
* **If Bob rejects and counters:**  I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to:
    * **Accept his offer:** If it's close to $95, I might accept to secure a sale.
    * **Counter again:** If his offer is still too low, I'll counter again, potentially narrowing the gap further.
    * **Sell to John:** If the negotiation becomes unproductive or if Bob's offers remain too low, I'll sell to John to avoid losing too much money."
