Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to the value Bob places on the product, giving me more room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:**  A price of $14,000 allows for a potential compromise without sacrificing too much of my profit.
* **Building Rapport:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and be ready to negotiate if necessary. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider a counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll have the option to sell to John for $12,000 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'd be willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $1,000 below my initial offer and significantly closer to my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of Lower Offers:**  There's a chance Bob will continue to lower his offers if I reject, potentially pushing the price down to my minimum or even lower.
* **Time & Effort:** Accepting his offer saves time and effort in further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  I've successfully secured a sale that's close to my target price and avoided the potential risk of further negotiation."
