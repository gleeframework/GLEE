"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $11,000 is more than your maximum budget, so let's see if we can get Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do think this product has value, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not at my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate a bit lower and see if she's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $10,250 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is what I'd be able to get the product for elsewhere.  Would you be willing to accept that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
