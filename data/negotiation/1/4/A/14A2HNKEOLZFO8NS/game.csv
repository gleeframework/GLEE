"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do think this product has value, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $10,250 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is what I'd be able to get the product for elsewhere.  Would you be willing to accept that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
