"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since you can buy the product for $12,000 from John, there's no point in accepting Alice's offer at the same price. Rejecting might lead to a better counter-offer from Alice."
