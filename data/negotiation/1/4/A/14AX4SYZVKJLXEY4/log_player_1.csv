Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $130.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.

Bob is not budging from his $130 offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $150."
