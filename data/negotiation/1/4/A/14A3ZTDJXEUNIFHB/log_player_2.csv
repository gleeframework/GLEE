"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $12,000 to you. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing to sell it to you for $10,000. This price reflects the value I place on your satisfaction while ensuring a fair return for my investment. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if there's anything else I can assist you with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is full of sales tactics, trying to inflate the perceived value of the product.  You know:

* **Your maximum value:** $12,000
* **Alice's value:** $8,000 
* **John's price:** $12,000

There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's first offer might lead to a better counter-offer closer to her $8,000 value. You're safe knowing you can always buy from John at $12,000 if needed."
