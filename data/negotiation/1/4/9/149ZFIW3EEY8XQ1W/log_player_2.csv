"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 more rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $75, a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to negotiate. This counteroffer should open the door to further discussion and potentially lead to a price we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  There are several rounds left, and it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $80, showing a willingness to compromise.  This is a small increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price that Alice might be willing to accept.  The pressure is mounting, as we're nearing the middle of the negotiation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement soon."
