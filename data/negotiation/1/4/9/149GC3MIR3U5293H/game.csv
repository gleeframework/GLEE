"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not getting any younger, and I really need this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of $90 and $105, which is $97.50. Can you consider that price?",97.5,Bob,6,
