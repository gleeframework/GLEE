"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while still making it a good deal for you.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that balances the product's value with my budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
