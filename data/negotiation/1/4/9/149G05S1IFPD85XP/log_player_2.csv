# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its worth to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a serious offer reflecting a willingness to find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement.  However, we're still quite a ways apart on price. To be frank, I need to see the numbers move closer to my original ask for this deal to make sense for me.  I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price point that's not advantageous for you.  Even though she's willing to negotiate, her ""final offer"" is still $100,000 more than your fallback option with John. It's unlikely she'll move significantly closer to your desired price, so cutting your losses and going with John is the most financially sound decision."
