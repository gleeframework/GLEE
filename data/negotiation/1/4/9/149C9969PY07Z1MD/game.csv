"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $950,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still give you a great deal on a product you know is valuable, and it would be a fair price for me. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I understand that we are not yet aligned on the price, but I would like to remain open to finding a solution that works for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while keeping it within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
