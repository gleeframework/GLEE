Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  I'll try a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but I still think there's room to meet closer to my initial offer. I'll counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, but I'm willing to meet you at $129. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point, and $129 is a reasonable deal. It's better to accept this offer than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John $150."
