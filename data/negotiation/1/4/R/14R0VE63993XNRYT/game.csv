"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to make a more substantial investment elsewhere. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to say that $900,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be totally transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. I can do $1,000,000, and I think that's more than fair.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I have to say that $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
