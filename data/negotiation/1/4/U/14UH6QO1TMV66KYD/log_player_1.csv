Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I consider other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could yield a quicker and still highly profitable sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it's presented as a ""deal"" compared to your other offer. This creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you subtly remind Bob that he could lose out if he doesn't act, even though you have a guaranteed sale with John."
