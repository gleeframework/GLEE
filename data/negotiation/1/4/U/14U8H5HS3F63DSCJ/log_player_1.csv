Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining or gives the impression of higher value.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high ($150 for example) will likely make Bob immediately reject the offer. 
* **Polite and Open-Ended:** The message is framed in a way that invites Bob to consider the offer and potentially counter-propose if he finds the price a little steep. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
