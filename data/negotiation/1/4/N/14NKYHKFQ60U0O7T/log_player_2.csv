# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I can still try to negotiate further. There's a chance I can get it lower than $1,275,000, potentially even closer to John's price."

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm getting closer to my target price with John. I'm not sure if I can push Alice lower without risking losing the deal. It's better to go with John's offer and guarantee the product at my desired price."
