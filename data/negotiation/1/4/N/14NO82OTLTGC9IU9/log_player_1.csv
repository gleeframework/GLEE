I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still too low for me. I need to hold out for a higher price, hopefully closer to my minimum of $1,200,000."

How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
