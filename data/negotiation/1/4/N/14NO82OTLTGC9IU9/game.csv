"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with the price. I'd like to offer $980,000. Can you consider that?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $980,000 still isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
