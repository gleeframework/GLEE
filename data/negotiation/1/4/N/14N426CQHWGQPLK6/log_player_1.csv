{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a significant investment. Could you tell me more about the product and its potential benefits to my business? I'm interested, but I need to understand its value better before committing. To show my interest, I'm willing to consider an offer of $500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $500,000 is far too low, and I believe the product has significantly more value to him than that. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $500,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident this product will generate substantial returns for your business.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product has value, but I need to be sure it aligns with my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $650000?  This price reflects the potential I see in this product while allowing me to make a responsible investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $650,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I believe the product has more value to him than that, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  It's truly unique and has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This price allows you to invest in a potentially lucrative opportunity while ensuring I receive a reasonable return. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $750000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant. To make this deal work, I need to be confident that the product's value justifies the investment. Would you be willing to consider a final offer of $700000? This price reflects the potential I see in this product while allowing me to make a responsible investment.  I'm open to hearing any final thoughts or details you might have about the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. Bob's offer of $700,000 is getting closer, but we're running out of rounds, and I'm not confident he'll go higher.  John's offer guarantees me a safe and secure sale, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
