"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
