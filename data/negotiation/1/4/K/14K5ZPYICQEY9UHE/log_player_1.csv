"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's lower than Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is still a good compromise, as it's closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum and a decent compromise.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
