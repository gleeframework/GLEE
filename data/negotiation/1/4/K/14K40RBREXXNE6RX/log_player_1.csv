Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a $1,000 profit, making it appealing.  It also allows me some profit, but keeps the door open for negotiation.  I am also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if Bob does not accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to make a deal, I can't accept something so far below my minimum. I will counter with a higher offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still offering you a great deal.  Let's try to work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10000. That's the maximum I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, I'm willing to accept this to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's important to note that even though I could get $12,000 from John, the negotiation with Bob has already taken time and effort. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
