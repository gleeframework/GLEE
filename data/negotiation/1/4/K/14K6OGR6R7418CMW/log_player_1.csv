Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, that's a great product. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm ready to offer $12000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a slightly higher price, aiming for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13000?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my counteroffer of $13,500.  I'm willing to accept this offer to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
