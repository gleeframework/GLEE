{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer sets a price that is higher than your minimum but also leaves room for negotiation. It allows for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while also maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $115 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is within my acceptable range and is a good compromise. It's better than selling to John for $100, so I'll accept it."
