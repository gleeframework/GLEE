Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** $14,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000), allowing for some flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and ""fair"" to encourage Bob's consideration. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup:** Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating in hopes of securing a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $14,000 to $13,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, making my counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion by asking Bob for his thoughts.  

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices while staying within my minimum acceptable value."
