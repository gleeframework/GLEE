"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
