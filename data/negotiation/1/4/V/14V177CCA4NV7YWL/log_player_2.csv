"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept anything higher.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he's already established that he's willing to walk away to get a better price."
