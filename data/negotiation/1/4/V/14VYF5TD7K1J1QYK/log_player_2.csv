**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price:**  Alice has dropped her price to $1,150,000, which is only $50,000 above Bob's counteroffer.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high:** If Bob rejects again, there's a chance Alice will be less willing to negotiate further, or even increase the price.
* **Buying from John is still more expensive:**  Even if Bob rejects Alice's offer and successfully negotiates a lower price, he still runs the risk of ending up paying more than Alice's current offer.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most sensible option to secure the product while still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
