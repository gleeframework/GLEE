"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
