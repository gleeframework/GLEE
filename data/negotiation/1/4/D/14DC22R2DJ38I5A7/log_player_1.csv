Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $13,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Limit:** You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay, only that the product is worth $10,000 to him. 
* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so there's no need to go below that price.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if vague like ""its value"") can make it seem more reasonable.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You get $1,500 more than your minimum and $1,500 more than Bob valued the product.
* **Bob negotiates:**  You have room to come down while still staying above your $12,000 minimum.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John at your desired price.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase the product."
