"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1200000, and I'm willing to make a significant investment. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
