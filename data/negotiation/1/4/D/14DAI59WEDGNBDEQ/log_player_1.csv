Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy it for $15,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out. 

This strategy balances risk and potential reward."
