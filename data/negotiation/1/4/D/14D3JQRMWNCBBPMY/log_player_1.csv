Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to Bob's value ($15,000) as possible without risking a rejection.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I believe I have some negotiating room left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
``` 

I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's still above my minimum, but closer to his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than selling to John, and we're getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000.  It's time to close the deal!"
