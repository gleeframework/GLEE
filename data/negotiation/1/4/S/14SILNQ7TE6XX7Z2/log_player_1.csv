Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my spending limit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
