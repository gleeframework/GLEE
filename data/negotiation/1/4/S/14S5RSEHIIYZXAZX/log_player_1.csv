Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the deal for Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not starting at my minimum, I allow for a back-and-forth negotiation process without risking a quick rejection.
* **Keeping John in mind:** My offer is significantly higher than John's offer, ensuring I won't be tempted to sell to him prematurely. 

This strategy allows for a dynamic negotiation process while still ensuring I can maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit high for my budget though. Would you consider $6,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).**  Accepting $6,000 would be a huge loss for me.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.** However, there's still potential to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.** While there's no guarantee of success, it's a better strategy than accepting Bob's offer or immediately selling to John. 

I'm choosing to continue the negotiation with Bob, aiming for a more profitable outcome than selling to John, but still holding onto my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** While I rejected Bob's initial counteroffer, I'm not completely shutting down the negotiation. I'm offering a compromise that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protect my interests.
* **Highlighting the value again:**  I remind Bob that this is still a good deal for him, aiming to make him more receptive to my counteroffer.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum, so there's room for further negotiation if necessary. However, it's getting closer to my desired price.

This counteroffer strikes a balance between being firm on my minimum acceptable price and keeping the negotiation open for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still a big loss for me.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.**  It's much closer to my minimum, and potentially more profitable.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.**  Although it's possible we won't reach an agreement, I'm not willing to accept a price that's so far below my minimum.

I'm choosing to continue the negotiation with Bob, aiming for a more profitable outcome than selling to John, but still holding onto my minimum acceptable price. I need to find a balance between maximizing my profit and avoiding a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7,500 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $8,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not giving up on the negotiation.  $8,500 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize the compromise:**  I explicitly state that this is a ""significant reduction"" and the ""closest I can go,"" highlighting my willingness to negotiate.
* **Create urgency:** I ask ""What do you think?"" to encourage Bob to make a decision and potentially avoid a stalemate. 

This counteroffer is designed to push Bob closer to my desired price while still being realistic about his budget constraints. It's a calculated move to try to close the deal while keeping the option to sell to John if necessary."
