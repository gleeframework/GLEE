Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7,500 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $8,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price for your budget."
