"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit high for my budget though. Would you consider $6,000 for the product?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $7,500 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $8,500. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
