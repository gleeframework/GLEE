"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the immense potential this product holds."", 
""product_price"": 1900000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still very far below the product's value to me and my minimum acceptable price. While his offer is increasing, it's happening slowly. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more significant movement from his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still substantial. To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your movement, we need to find a more realistic price point.  I'm willing to raise my offer to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm prepared to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his final offer, and it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I find acceptable. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
