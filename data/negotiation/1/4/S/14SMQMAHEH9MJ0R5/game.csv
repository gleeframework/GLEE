"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and takes into account the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is non-negotiable below a certain point. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000  as my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. Can we meet in the middle again?",980000.0,Bob,6,
