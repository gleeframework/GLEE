Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,500,000 is a significant drop.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,550,000. This still leaves room for negotiation and aligns better with my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly above John's offer.  It's worth pushing Bob a little further to see if we can get closer to $1,600,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I am willing to offer $1,575,000 for the product. This price allows for some flexibility in our negotiations while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,575,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
