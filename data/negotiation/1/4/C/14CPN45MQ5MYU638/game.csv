"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $105. I can do $115, as I mentioned earlier, or we can discuss further. But I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $112.5. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",108.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $109? I'm willing to make a small concession to get the deal done.",109.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice! I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $108? I think this is as low as I can go, but I really want to make this deal work.",108.0,Bob,8,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can go any lower than $108.25. I'm willing to make one last concession to get the deal done. How about we meet exactly at $108.25? It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it.",108.25,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $108.25. I've already stretched my budget as far as I can. I'm going to have to walk away from this deal. Sorry, Alice. I appreciate your time and effort, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,,
