Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$115 is a good starting point.** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and positive.** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I'll also be willing to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob, especially since he expressed interest in the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.**  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **The message is still friendly and encouraging.**  I want to maintain a positive atmosphere to keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

By offering $105, I'm aiming to find a middle ground. This price is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to reconsider and potentially lead to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit too far from my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.** While Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, his offer is still too low for me to accept. 
* **I'm confident I can get a higher price.**  I've already demonstrated flexibility, and I believe there's still potential to reach an agreement closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll also keep in mind the potential of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob continues to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can ensure the product goes to a good home."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:**  $100 is the midpoint between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's latest offer of $95. This demonstrates my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:** The message highlights that $100 is a fair price for both of us.
* **Reinforce positive outcome:** I reiterate that I want the product to go to a good home, implying that Bob is the ideal buyer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. I believe $100 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping that this final offer will be accepted. If Bob still rejects, I will proceed to sell the product to John for $120, as his offer is more profitable for me."
