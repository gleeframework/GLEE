"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are more rounds, so rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price, making it a potential win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's target price.  There are still several rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if a lower price is possible.  Bob can likely get closer to his target price by counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price. He's offering a slightly higher amount than his previous counter-offer, but still lower than Alice's latest offer. This approach shows that he's willing to negotiate while still sticking to his goal of saving money.  It's likely that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice as it's closer to her own acceptable price."
