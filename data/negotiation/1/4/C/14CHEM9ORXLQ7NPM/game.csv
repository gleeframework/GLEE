"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,250.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",13250.0,Bob,4,
