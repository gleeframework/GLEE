Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that I think is reasonable, but not too high. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a bit higher than the minimum value I have in mind, but I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value, but it's still a decent offer. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $800,000, I'll choose option 1 and accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
