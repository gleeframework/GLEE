"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $9,500 is still a bit outside of what I can realistically afford. I'm happy to offer you $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that it's the best deal you'll get.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
