"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget, so rejecting and counter-offering is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significantly lower price point, giving you room to maneuver. It's also a bold move that could get Alice to seriously consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high, but she is showing a willingness to negotiate.  It's worth continuing to counteroffer and see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This counteroffer is a more incremental decrease than the last round. It shows that you are taking Alice's offer seriously while still pushing for a better price. It's also closer to your maximum budget, giving you some room to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 is closer to your budget, we can still try to get a lower price. There's still room to negotiate and you have 5 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer brings us closer to your maximum budget while leaving room for further negotiation. You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is tempting, we can likely get a better price. We have 3 rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while staying within your budget. You're signaling to Alice that you're getting very close to your limit, making it more likely that she will accept your offer.  The remaining rounds should be focused on closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has finally met your price! Accepting her offer is the best choice because:

* **You're within your budget:** $12,750 is within your maximum price point of $12,000.
* **You're close to closing the deal:** This is the last round before you have to buy from John. It's highly likely that Alice won't lower the price any further.

While you could counteroffer again and hope for a better deal, the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice is too high. It's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's acceptable to you."
