"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is just too far below what I need to make this worth it.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This gives us both a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $10,000? This would allow me to sell and you to get a good deal on a product you really want.",10000.0,Alice,5,
