{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $9,800 is a good compromise that's above my minimum and gets me a sale.  There's only a few rounds left, so it's better to secure this deal rather than risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John."
