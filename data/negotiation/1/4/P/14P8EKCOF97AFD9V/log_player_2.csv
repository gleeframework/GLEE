(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While you might not get the lowest price, continuing the negotiation gives you the potential to do better than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a price $50,000 less than Alice's initial offer, which is a significant discount.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, leaving room for further negotiation without being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, I can potentially push Alice down further, getting closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1060000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, so I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,060,000. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, while still leaving room for compromise. It's a small enough increment to be acceptable to Alice, but still pushes her closer to my ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is only $40,000 more than my last counteroffer.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to get me a significantly better deal.  It's more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still significantly better than buying from John."
