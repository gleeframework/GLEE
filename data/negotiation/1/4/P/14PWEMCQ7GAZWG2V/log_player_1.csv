"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking $150 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** $150 gives me a good starting point for negotiation, with room to drop the price if necessary without going below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $120 is above my minimum, I believe there's still potential for a higher price. Bob has shown interest, so I'm willing to continue negotiating. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will likely counter with something slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desire for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $135,  but I'm not sure I can go any lower.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not completely accepting it.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to pay a bit more. 
* **Maintaining Value:** $135 is still significantly above my minimum, so I'm not risking losing out on much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance Bob will walk away or I'll end up having to accept an offer closer to $100.  
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm already on round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time and having to sell to John for $100. 

While I would prefer a higher price, it's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to risk losing the deal altogether."
