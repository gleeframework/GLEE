"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that be feasible?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but I can't go any lower than that.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
