"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $17000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14500 for it. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $15500.  This is a fair price considering the value you've stated and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
