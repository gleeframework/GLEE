Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can find a price closer to the value of the product. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. However, $95 is too low for me.  Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $95. It seems to be a fair price given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, Bob seems anchored at $95. Accepting ensures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal."
