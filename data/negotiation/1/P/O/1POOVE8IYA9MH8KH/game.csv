"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $140? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference at $120?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $130. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that. How about we meet at $132? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it.",132.0,Alice,5,
