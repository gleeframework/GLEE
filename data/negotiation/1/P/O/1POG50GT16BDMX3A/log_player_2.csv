{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within his budget, it's still more than what he could get from John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. He's hoping to meet Alice somewhere in the middle. While this offer might be rejected, it sets the tone for negotiation and establishes Bob's willingness to make concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a better deal, as there are still rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but still aiming for a price lower than $1,100,000. This counteroffer is a compromise, hoping to find a middle ground before needing to consider John's offer."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his target, it's still a bit higher than John's price. There are still more rounds to go, so Bob should keep trying to negotiate with Alice for a lower price. He can always choose to buy from John later if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer, but still trying to negotiate a lower price. He's increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise.  He's hoping Alice will accept this offer as it's only $10,000 less than her last offer and is within his budget. He wants to secure a deal without resorting to John's offer, as he still hopes to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $5,000 less than her previous offer. There are only a few rounds remaining. This suggests Alice is not willing to go much lower.  Bob has already made several concessions and is getting close to his maximum price. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees him the product at the best possible price, securing a deal and avoiding further negotiation risk."
