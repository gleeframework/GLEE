"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to save some money.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,875.  This would allow both of us to get a good deal, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",10875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11,100. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm getting close to my minimum price, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon.",11100.0,Alice,5,
