{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a mutually acceptable price.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us.  Additionally,  John's offer remains a safety net, ensuring I can still achieve my desired profit if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000. While it's still below my ideal, it's a fair compromise considering his perceived value for the product.  I'm willing to accept this offer as it's better than the potential loss if I continue to negotiate and eventually have to sell to John for his lower offer."
