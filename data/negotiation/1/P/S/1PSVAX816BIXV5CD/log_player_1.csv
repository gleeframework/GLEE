Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it would be very valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  At $100, you're still leaving room for negotiation while ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** This allows for flexibility in case Bob counters with a lower price.
* **The message is friendly and inviting:** This sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $100 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go all the way to $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired price and what John is willing to pay.  Since I can get $120 from John, it doesn't make sense to continue negotiating with Bob.  Even if I were to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee that Bob would accept, and I could end up wasting time and potentially missing out on the higher price from John."
