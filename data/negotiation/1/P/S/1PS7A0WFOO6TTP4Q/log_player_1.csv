Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price sensitivity. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you've created room for negotiation. You can gradually lower the price, knowing your bottom line is secure with John. 

**Important Note:**  While aiming high is a good starting strategy, be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's reactions and potential counter-offers."
