Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""great deal for the value,"" I'm subtly implying the product is worth more than my asking price.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can then decide whether to lower the price slightly or move on to John, who guarantees my minimum acceptable price."
