"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a better price than $150, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:**  $135 is a good price for Bob. It's below his initial limit of $150 and within a reasonable range considering Alice's initial price.
* **Rounds:** It's only round 3, and Alice has already made a concession.  There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice refusing to budge.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance he might end up paying the full $150 to John.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a decent deal without risking further negotiation."
