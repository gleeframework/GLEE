Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for [PRICE] for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also hints at potential negotiation, which could be useful later.
* **Product Price:**  I've set the price at $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting at $150, I have room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower price.
* **Negotiation:**  The message encourages negotiation, which could lead to a higher sale price if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Backup:** I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $100 if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not taking a significant risk by setting a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on how Bob reacts and any information I gather about his potential willingness to pay."
