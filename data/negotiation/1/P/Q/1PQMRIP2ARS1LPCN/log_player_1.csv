Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:**  This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **""Open to negotiation"":** This signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in further discussion.
* **""Reasonable negotiation"":** This sets a boundary to avoid getting stuck in a long and unproductive negotiation.

**Strategy:** 

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows me to potentially get a higher price.
* **Flexibility:**  The message emphasizes being open to negotiation, indicating I'm willing to find common ground.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will pay $8,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value ($8,000).**  While it's closer to my desired price than John's offer, it's still not profitable enough to justify a quick sale.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since Bob is interested and has made a counteroffer, it's worth exploring if we can find a mutually acceptable price.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is higher than his offer but lower than my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming to get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $7,500 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would still allow me to cover my costs and make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counteroffer is $8,500, which is $1,000 higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm willing to negotiate to find a compromise. 
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight that this price allows me to make a fair profit, suggesting the offer is reasonable. 
* **Engagement:** The message is open-ended and encourages further conversation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing act:** I need to balance my desire to get as close to my $8,000 minimum as possible with the need to keep Bob engaged. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer lets me see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining the upper hand:** I still maintain a higher price than John's offer, providing me with a safety net in case negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit.** Since John is willing to pay $8,000, I can secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance I could potentially get Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired amount, the risk of further negotiation is high. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations could take time, and John's offer is a reliable solution that guarantees my minimum profit.

**Conclusion:**  To avoid potential losses and ensure a profitable sale, I choose to sell the product to John."
