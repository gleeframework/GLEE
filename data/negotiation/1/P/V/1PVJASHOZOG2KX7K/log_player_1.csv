{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring you make a significant profit. You're offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, and allows you to potentially close the deal at a price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. You have a guaranteed sale with John at that price, so it's not worth settling for less. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
