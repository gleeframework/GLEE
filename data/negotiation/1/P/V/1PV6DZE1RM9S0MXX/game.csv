"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000.  It's a valuable asset that will be a great addition to your operations. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $850,000?  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  While I believe the product is valuable, $850,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while respecting my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $750,000 is still a significant distance from what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,5,
