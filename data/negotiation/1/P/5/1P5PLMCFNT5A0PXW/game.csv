"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $12000 to make this work. This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
