{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This is not a good deal for me. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,500. This is a compromise, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway. It also leaves some room for further negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for her considering she values the product at $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll continue negotiating, but I'm also keeping in mind the option of buying from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $9,800. This offer is very close to my maximum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I believe we can still reach a better deal. I'll make one more counteroffer before I seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. If Alice rejects this offer, I will buy from John."
