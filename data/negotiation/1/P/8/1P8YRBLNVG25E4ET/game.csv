"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,750.

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm offering it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,7,
