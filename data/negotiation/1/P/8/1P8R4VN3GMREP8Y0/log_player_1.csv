Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation. Even if Bob doesn't accept this initial price, it sets a higher reference point for the rest of the discussion. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is more than Bob initially valued the product for, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price and am willing to walk away from the deal. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):** I've come down from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's perspective. 
* **Midpoint:** Suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers can sometimes feel like a fair compromise and encourage agreement. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, but only slightly. It's clear he's anchored to a price point well below my minimum.  At this stage, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
