Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving room for profit:**  A price of $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 discount while still earning you a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Polite and open-ended:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and inviting discussion. 
 
**Alternative Strategy:**

You could consider a slightly lower offer (e.g., $13,000) to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting immediately. However, the chosen strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit."
