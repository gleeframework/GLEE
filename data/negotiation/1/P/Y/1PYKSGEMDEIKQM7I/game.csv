"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,800? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll find it's a fair compromise.",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting closer.  To make this work, I need to stay closer to my budget.  How about $12,000 even and we can get this deal done?",12000.0,Bob,6,
