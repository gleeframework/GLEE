Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. While she has a guaranteed $10,000 from John, selling to Bob for more would be ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's perceived value ($8,000) allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still come down slightly while staying above her minimum. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By mentioning a ""discounted price,"" Alice subtly implies this offer won't last forever, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept. Alice could offer a lower price to increase the chances of a sale, but that risks leaving money on the table if Bob would have paid more."
