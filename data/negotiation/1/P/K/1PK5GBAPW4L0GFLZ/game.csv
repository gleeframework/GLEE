"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $1800000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1400000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've already offered you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'd be willing to go up to $1000000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000, Bob. That's not even close to what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $1400000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to John for $1500000, which is a much better deal for me.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
