Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is the maximum you're willing to pay, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
