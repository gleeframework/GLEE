"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I think the product is worth more than $10,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,750.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $11,250? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but I think that's the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
