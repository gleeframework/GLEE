"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended Question:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I invite Bob to engage in the negotiation and provide a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm willing to explore a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and show that I am not desperate for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $9,250. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway. 
* **Appeal to Speed:** I emphasize the benefit of a quick closing, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While offering a lower price, I still aim for a price that's above my minimum and provides some room for further negotiation."
