"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $1,350,000 is my best offer right now. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my original offer. How about $1,400,000? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is a better price than John's offer of $1,500,000.  Even though Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that further negotiations will take too long.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial option at this point."
