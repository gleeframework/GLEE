{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob's likely to counter, and you'll have room to bargain.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes it tempting for him to accept, as he sees the product as worth more. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. We'll adapt our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $1,350,000 is my best offer right now. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While $1,350,000 is more than our minimum, it's still below our ideal price. We'll use this opportunity to make a counteroffer and see if we can get closer to our target of $1,450,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my original offer. How about $1,400,000? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
