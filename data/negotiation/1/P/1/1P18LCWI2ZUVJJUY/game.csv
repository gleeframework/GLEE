"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable profit. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $120, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,6,
