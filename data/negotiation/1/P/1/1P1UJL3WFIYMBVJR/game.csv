"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I believe could be worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
