Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not so high as to be immediately unreasonable.  This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than my minimum, it's still a bit lower than I'd like to go. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still being closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $135 is only $5 below my initial offer and is a good compromise.  There's a chance we could go back and forth a few more rounds but the risk is that Bob will get frustrated and walk away.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk getting a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
