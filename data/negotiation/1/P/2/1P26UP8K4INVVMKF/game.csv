"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save some money, but I'm still very interested in the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your attempt to negotiate. However, considering the quality and value of the product, I cannot agree to the $90 price point. I would like to counter with an offer of $105. This price reflects the product's true worth while still allowing for a reasonable savings for you.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
