"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",650000.0,Bob,4,
