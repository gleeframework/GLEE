Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (Your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to scare Bob away with a price too close to his maximum. A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives both of you a reasonable share of the potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000.  This is a fair deal that allows us both to benefit."", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Confident, but not aggressive.  You acknowledge the value to Bob without underselling yourself.
* **Price:** $1,125,000. This splits the potential $200,000 profit almost evenly, giving you $125,000 more than your minimum, and leaving Bob with a potential $75,000 gain. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($1,000,000 from John) is crucial.
* **Relationship:**  While maximizing profit is the goal, consider the long-term implications. Leaving Bob with a positive feeling could be beneficial for future dealings."
