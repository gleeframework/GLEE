"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is quite high, and I can't go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,750 is closer to what I have in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more.  Would you consider $8,900? This feels like a fair compromise.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're looking for a bit more, Alice, but I'm getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",8800.0,Bob,6,
