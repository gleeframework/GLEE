"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $900,000. This is my best offer and reflects the value this product will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
