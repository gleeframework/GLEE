"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $10200. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",10200.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10200 yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
