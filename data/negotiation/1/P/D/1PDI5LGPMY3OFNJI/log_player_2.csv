"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1200000 to me, and I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product. I believe this is a competitive offer considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You can do better than $900,000. You have a good counter-offer to start the negotiation."
