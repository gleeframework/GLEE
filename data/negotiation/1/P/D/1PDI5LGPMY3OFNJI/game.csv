"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we've discussed, the product is worth $1200000 to me, and I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product. I believe this is a competitive offer considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $800000.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering a price of $875000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being closer to your budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
