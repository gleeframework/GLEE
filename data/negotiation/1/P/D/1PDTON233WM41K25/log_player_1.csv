"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.

**Note:** I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I'm not giving away too much in the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).**  Selling to John at this point would be more profitable.
* **However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better deal. 

I will counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to close the deal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much.
* **Fair Offer:** $11,000 is still above Bob's initial offer, but lower than my starting price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I remind Bob that this is still a good deal for him. 

**Goal:** I want to see if this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**
* **We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing out on the higher price from John.**

Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible profit and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better deal."
