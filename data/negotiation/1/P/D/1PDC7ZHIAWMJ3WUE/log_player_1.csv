Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the immense benefit it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's negotiating style, you might offer a slightly lower price to increase the chances of a quick sale. 
* It's crucial to appear confident and firm in your offer."
