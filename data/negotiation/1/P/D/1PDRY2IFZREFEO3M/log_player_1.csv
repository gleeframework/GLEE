{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get. This can encourage him to accept. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* I have the backup option of selling to John if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value to me while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum price of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer isn't close enough.
* I'm choosing to reject his offer and continue the negotiation with the goal of getting a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob. My counteroffer will be higher than his offer but likely lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000 for your consideration. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to be satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,075,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and trying to create a collaborative tone. I'm also reminding Bob of the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

**Strategy:**

* By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* However, I'm not going below my minimum value of $1,200,000 (since I have the option to sell to John). 
* My aim is to get as close to that minimum as possible while still securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000 for your product. I believe this price is fair and within our range of mutual agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my initial asking price, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* I'm choosing to reject his offer because I have a guaranteed sale to John for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, potentially raising the price slightly from my previous offer to see if we can find a meeting point. 
* However, if Bob remains insistent on his price, I'll ultimately sell to John, as that guarantees my minimum value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,075,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm reiterating the importance of fairness and mutually beneficial agreement. I'm also using a slightly more assertive tone, suggesting that this offer is my final compromise.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a balance between meeting Bob's budget and staying close to my minimum value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for coming down to $1,065,000. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,060,000. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While we've come closer, it's not a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that I can get my minimum value by selling to John, so that's the best course of action.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees me the full $1,200,000, ensuring I reach my minimum goal.
* **Time Efficiency:** Further negotiations with Bob could take more time and might not lead to a better outcome.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or making even lower offers. 

By selling to John, I secure the best possible outcome for myself while minimizing risk and maximizing efficiency."
