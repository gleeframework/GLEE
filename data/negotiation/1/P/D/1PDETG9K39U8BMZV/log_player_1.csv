Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, you want to start with a price significantly higher to explore Bob's maximum willingness to pay.
* **Justification for Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price without revealing your minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative (""Let me know your thoughts...""), signaling  potential for negotiation if Bob finds the initial price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by testing Bob's price sensitivity while still securing a profitable sale with John if needed."
