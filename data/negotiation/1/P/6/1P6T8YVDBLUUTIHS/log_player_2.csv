# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

Alice's offer is higher than I'd like. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to leave room for negotiation. However, it's still a price that would be profitable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle, but I think I can get a slightly better deal. I'll counteroffer again."

{
""message"": ""I understand, $125 is getting closer. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair compromise."",

I'm aiming for Alice's lowest acceptable price, hoping she'll agree to finalize the deal."
