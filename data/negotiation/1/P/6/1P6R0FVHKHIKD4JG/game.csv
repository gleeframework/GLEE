"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can work something out.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to both of us. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still too far off from my valuation. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a profitable sale. I hope you'll consider this offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,550,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,525,000. This is the absolute highest I can go, and it allows us both to make a good deal. I hope you'll accept my final offer.",1525000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, your offer of $1,525,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to secure a slightly higher amount. Let's split the difference once more.  I'm willing to accept $1,537,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.
