"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above my maximum budget and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to both of us. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still higher than my target price. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can close the gap. There's no need to jump to John yet, as there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,450,000 is still too far off from my valuation. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,550,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a profitable sale. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still above my maximum price. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I'm not ready to buy from John yet.  I'll counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,550,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,525,000. This is the absolute highest I can go, and it allows us both to make a good deal. I hope you'll accept my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1525000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer of $1,525,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to secure a slightly higher amount. Let's split the difference once more.  I'm willing to accept $1,537,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,537,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,537,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,537,500 is still slightly above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, we're down to the wire with only a few rounds left.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John for my target price and avoid the risk of further negotiation delays."
