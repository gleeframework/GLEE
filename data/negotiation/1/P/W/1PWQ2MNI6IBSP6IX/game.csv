"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $650,000 is a bit too high for me at this moment. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $500,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer of $500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $575,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",575000.0,Alice,3,
