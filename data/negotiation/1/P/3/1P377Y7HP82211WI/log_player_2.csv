"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm offering you a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay.  It makes the most sense to buy from John for $100."
