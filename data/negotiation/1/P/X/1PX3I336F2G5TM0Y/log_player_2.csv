Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is within my budget and is a good compromise.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice is firm on this price, and continuing to negotiate could risk her walking away from the deal. At this point, accepting the offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a good price."
