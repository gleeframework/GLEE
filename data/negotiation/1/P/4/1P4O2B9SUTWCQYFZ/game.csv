"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",130.0,Bob,4,
