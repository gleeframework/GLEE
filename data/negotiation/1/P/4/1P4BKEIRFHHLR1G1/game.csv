"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a little out of my range. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go up to $15500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
