You should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and you can do better.  You want to save as much money as possible, so negotiating is the best course of action."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to your target. You should reject this offer and counter with a lower price, aiming for something closer to $15,000. You're almost there, so don't give up on negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $15500, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16250. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250.

Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $15,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that the price will go up again or the negotiation will drag on. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $15,000, as it's a guaranteed deal at your maximum price."
