Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,090,000.
