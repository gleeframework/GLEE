Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable insight into his level of interest and flexibility. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you can then work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the likelihood of a profitable outcome for you."
