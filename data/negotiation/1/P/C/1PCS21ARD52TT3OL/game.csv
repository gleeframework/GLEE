"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's try $80.  That's my absolute final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
