"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,500. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,500 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Could you do $13,000? That would work much better for me.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $13,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best deal I can offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
