"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. That's the highest I can go.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
