"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. It's a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering its value. Let's find a middle ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,
