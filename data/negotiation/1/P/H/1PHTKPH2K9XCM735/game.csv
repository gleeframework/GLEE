"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe that price point is a little high for me. I would be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still not fully reflected in your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify that price point. Could you consider coming down a bit further?  I'd be happy to close the deal at $760,000.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
