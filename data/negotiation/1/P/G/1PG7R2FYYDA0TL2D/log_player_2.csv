Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a more reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach.  How about we settle this right now at $950,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a win-win for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is my final offer. If it works, we can close this out today.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000.  While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer.""  You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, which is a significant saving."
