"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room to negotiate downwards. This also establishes a strong perceived value for the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my minimum is $1,000,000,  I don't want to start there. Bob's counteroffers will reveal how much he's truly willing to pay.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value might encourage Bob to make a more serious offer.

This strategy balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to engage Bob in a meaningful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his offer is low, it confirms he's interested.  I'll counter to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome.  Selling to John is a last resort if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This feels like a more reasonable starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** I politely reject Bob's low offer while explaining why it's unacceptable.
* **Significant Drop, Strategic Positioning:** I reduce my price by $200,000, a substantial move signaling flexibility. However, I remain well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value & Mutual Benefit:** I reiterate the product's value and frame the negotiation as a partnership where both parties win. 
* **Setting a Higher Floor:** This counteroffer establishes a higher baseline for future rounds, pushing the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's try to find a middle ground here. $1,100,000 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This seems like a fair price that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob reaching his perceived value of $800,000 is significant. However, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my minimum. Selling to John is a guaranteed profit but I haven't fully explored the potential with Bob yet. I'll counteroffer to signal I'm open to a deal but not at this price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach.  How about we settle this right now at $950,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** I start by acknowledging his recognition of the product's value and his effort to find a fair deal. This builds rapport and sets a positive tone.
* **Firm but Fair Counter:** Offering $950,000 is a strategic move. It's a significant step down from my previous offer, signaling flexibility, but it's still comfortably above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By suggesting we ""settle this right now,"" I introduce a subtle sense of urgency. This might prompt Bob to act quickly, especially if he's genuinely interested. 
* **Win-Win Framing:** Emphasizing a ""win-win"" outcome reinforces the idea that we're both getting a good deal. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of closing the deal with Bob soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Would you consider $850,000?  I think that's a strong offer, and it would allow us to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for him to move closer to my $1,000,000 minimum. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation for the potential of a higher profit, but I'll need to carefully consider my next move to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is my final offer. If it works, we can close this out today."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** It's time to signal that I'm reaching my limit.  Stating this is my final offer adds weight to the negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm dropping to $925,000, a smaller concession than previous rounds. This shows I'm serious, but not desperate.
* **Call to Action:**  Again, encouraging a quick close keeps the momentum going and might prompt a decision from Bob.
* **Underlying Message:** By holding firm close to my minimum, I'm communicating that the product's value is non-negotiable below a certain point. 

This approach maintains a balance between firmness and flexibility. It also prepares me to walk away from the deal if Bob isn't willing to meet my price, as I still have the guaranteed offer from John."
