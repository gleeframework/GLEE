"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's be realistic, this product is worth $1500000 to me, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your maximum budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1500000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
