"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it has immense potential and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its features. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating that you're serious about negotiating. It's important to be bold but also realistic. You're leaving room for negotiation while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget, although it's a better price than her initial offer. It's important to keep negotiating to see if we can get closer to my budget. I'm willing to take another round to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's be realistic, this product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing Boundaries:**  I'm  pushing closer to my maximum budget, but I'm leaving room for negotiation if Alice is still hesitant. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Alice that the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, implying that this price reflects its worth. 
* **Setting an Ultimatum:** This counteroffer implies a deadline, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to take a serious look at my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your maximum budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1500000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,700,000 is still above my budget, and we've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price. Given that John is willing to sell the product for my maximum budget of $1,500,000, it's more efficient and financially beneficial to secure the product from him."
