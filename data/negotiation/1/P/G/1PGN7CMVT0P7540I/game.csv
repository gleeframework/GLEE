"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, and I believe it holds even greater value for your business. I'm confident it can significantly enhance your operations. To get things started, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which still provides you with a good profit.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product brings.  It's a significant investment for both of us, so let's aim for a price that's fair and benefits both sides.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves room for you to gain substantial value.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe is fair.  We both stand to gain significantly from this deal.  Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,160,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
