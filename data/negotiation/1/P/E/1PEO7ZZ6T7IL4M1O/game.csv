"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While $1,800,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet closer to the middle at $2,100,000? This reflects its unique qualities and the potential return on investment it offers.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. Considering your initial offer was $2,300,000, I think we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. How about we meet at $2,050,000? This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
