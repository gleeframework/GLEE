{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate.  It's important to consider the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, but you can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget at $16000. I'd be willing to pay $14500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,500 is getting closer, I'm still determined to get closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500 for this unique product. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $14800 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $14,800 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum. I'm confident I can get more if I continue negotiating, but the risk of losing the deal to John is getting higher. Accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable choice at this point."
