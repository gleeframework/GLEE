"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a truly valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's within your budget, it's still a significant amount. You can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still quite high. There's still room for negotiation.  We can try to get a lower price, as $1,150,000 is still far more than the product is worth to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This price would give you a substantial profit, and would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I respect that.  However,  we are still quite far apart. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000, as a final concession.  This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to getting this deal done. Let me know if you're ready to move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what we're aiming for, but we're getting closer. It's worth seeing if we can push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer will allow us to continue negotiations and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a good compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
