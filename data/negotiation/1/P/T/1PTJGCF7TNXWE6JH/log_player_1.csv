Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
