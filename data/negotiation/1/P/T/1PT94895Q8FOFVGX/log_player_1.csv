Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still being a price that could be enticing enough for him to accept outright.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes ""value"" to persuade Bob that the price is justified, even if it's slightly more than he initially valued the product. 
* **Direct and clear:**  The message is straightforward and avoids being overly aggressive, aiming for a positive first interaction. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to ensure a sale to Bob, you could start with a higher price closer to $150. However, this strategy balances the potential for higher profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
