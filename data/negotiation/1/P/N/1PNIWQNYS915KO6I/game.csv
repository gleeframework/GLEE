"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $11000. I'll try to meet you in the middle again, so I'll counter with a price of $12250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I'll counter with a price of $12000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
