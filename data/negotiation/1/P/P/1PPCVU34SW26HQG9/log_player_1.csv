{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I want to maximize my profit, but I also want to make the deal.  $100 is a fair starting point, allowing for some room to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $120, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. 
* **Negotiation:**  Starting with a lower offer allows for potential counteroffers and gives Bob some leverage, making him more likely to engage.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully consider any counteroffers Bob makes, keeping John's offer in mind. 
* My goal is to reach a price that is at least $120 or higher, but I'm willing to be flexible to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I can get from another seller. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $90 is closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $120.
* **Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get closer to my target price. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more if he sees I'm not desperate to sell.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target price. I will consider a price between $90 and $120, but it will be closer to the higher end of that range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit low for me. Considering the quality and value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** I recognize that Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his initial offer. 
* **Flexibility:** While $110 is my ideal price, I'm willing to negotiate further to find a solution that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* I will closely evaluate Bob's response. 
* If he rejects this counteroffer, I will consider my options, weighing the risk of potentially losing a deal with Bob against the certainty of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $110, which would be $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $95 is closer to my initial target price of $100, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $120. This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might lead to a lower price or a lengthy process. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would require more time and effort, potentially leading to a situation where I end up with less than John's guaranteed price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I reach my minimum acceptable value and guarantees a quick and straightforward transaction."
