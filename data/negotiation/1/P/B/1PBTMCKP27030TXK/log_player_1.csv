{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $130 is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $130, I can potentially get a better price than John's offer if Bob is willing to bargain. 
* **Friendly tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to start the conversation. 

I'm willing to negotiate further based on Bob's response, but I'm ready to walk away if he doesn't get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that's so far below my minimum. 
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm highlighting the value for Bob, reminding him that $110 is still a good price compared to the value he gets from the product.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, hoping to keep the negotiation open and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $95 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150, even with his claim of meeting me halfway.
* **No pressure to accept:**  I have John lined up as a buyer for $150, so I don't feel pressured to accept Bob's offer.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he might come up a bit more. I believe there's still a chance to get a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go for $102.50.  This way, we both make a compromise and can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my last offer ($110) and Bob's current offer ($95), demonstrating a genuine effort to find a compromise.
* **Presenting it as a win-win:**  I emphasize that this solution allows both of us to make a compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  I continue to keep the communication positive and inviting, hoping to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $95. How about $97.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to my minimum:** While Bob has come up a bit to $97.50, it's still quite far from my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Time to cut my losses:**  We've been negotiating for several rounds, and it seems Bob is unwilling to go significantly higher.  
* **John is a guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.  There's no guarantee that Bob will continue to offer higher prices, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.

While I'd like to get a higher price from Bob, selling to John guarantees my desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
