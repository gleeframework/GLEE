,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both be happy with.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the maximum I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go for $102.50.  This way, we both make a compromise and can reach a deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
