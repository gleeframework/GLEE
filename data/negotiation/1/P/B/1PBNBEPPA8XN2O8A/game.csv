"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $110. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product for $105. This is my final offer below $110, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not going to go any higher. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product for $115. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",115.0,Alice,7,
