This offer is above Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate. It's also lower than my minimum, giving me room to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to stick to my budget of $10,000. Could you consider bringing the price down to match this amount? I believe it would be a fair compromise for both of us.

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer. While I'd prefer to get a better price, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get the best possible outcome."
