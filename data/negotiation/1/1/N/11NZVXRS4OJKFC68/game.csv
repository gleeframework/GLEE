"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. Would you be interested in an offer of $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? This would be a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $105? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $95 or lower. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $100?  I really believe this product is worth it to you, and this price would allow us to finalize the deal.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $98, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",98.0,Bob,8,
