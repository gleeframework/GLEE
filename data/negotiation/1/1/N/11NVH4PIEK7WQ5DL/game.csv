"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit higher than your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $130. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think this is the lowest I can go, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",120.0,Bob,6,
