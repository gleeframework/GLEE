"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $10,000 to me, so I would be paying too much if I accept her offer. I will buy the product from John for $10,000.
