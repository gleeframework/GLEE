Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  $12,000 (You'll sell to John at this price).
* **Bob's Value:** $10,000 (The maximum he'd be willing to pay).
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Technically, there's no ZOPA.  The lowest you'll accept is higher than the highest Bob will pay.

**The Strategy**

Since Bob values the product less than your minimum price, you have two options:

1. **High Offer Hoping for a Surprise:**  You could try a high offer (e.g., $13,000) hoping Bob might value the product more than you realize or is willing to overpay. This is risky, as it's likely to lead to rejection.

2. **Secure the Guaranteed Sale:** Offer the product to Bob at a price slightly lower than your guaranteed sale price to John. This ensures you make a sale and still get close to your minimum.

**The Offer**

I recommend option 2 for a higher chance of success:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm willing to make you a special offer of $11,900. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Time-Sensitive:** Creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity.
* **Slight Discount:**  Entices Bob with a deal while maximizing your profit.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer, sticking to his $10,000 valuation. In that case, you'll still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000."
