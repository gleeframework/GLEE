"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's estimated value.  This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite, or if he wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good amount, it's still below my minimum target of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my minimum goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum target, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm still trying to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that I'm running out of rounds. This counteroffer is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price, considering the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer is just above my minimum target and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob with only 4 rounds left.  It's better to secure this deal and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
