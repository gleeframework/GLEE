"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500?  That's still a fair price for a product worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, but I can't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
