Round 2

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,075,000 is cutting it a little too close. How about $1,112,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,112,500
