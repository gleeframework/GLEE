"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $1,075,000? I think this price is fair for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,075,000 is cutting it a little too close. How about $1,112,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. That's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.  Let's make a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
