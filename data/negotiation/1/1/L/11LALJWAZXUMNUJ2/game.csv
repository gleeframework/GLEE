"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a little steep for me right now.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
