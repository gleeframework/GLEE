You can get a better price than $90. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}

This is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's closer to Alice's value of $80 and still leaves some room for negotiation."
