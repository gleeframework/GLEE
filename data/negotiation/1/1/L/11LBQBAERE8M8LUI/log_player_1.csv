Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave Bob with enough incentive to accept the deal. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit ($150,000).
* **Leaves Value for Bob:** Bob still gets a good deal, saving $50,000 from his perceived value.
* **Confidence:** The language suggests the product's high value and the exclusivity of the offer, subtly adding pressure.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate a bit, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum. You have John as a reliable fallback option."
