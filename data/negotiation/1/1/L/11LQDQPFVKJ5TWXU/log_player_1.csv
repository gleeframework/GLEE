{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is still a significant amount of money. I also know that if I reject his offer, he'll likely go with John, and I'll be stuck with the $1,000,000 offer.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
