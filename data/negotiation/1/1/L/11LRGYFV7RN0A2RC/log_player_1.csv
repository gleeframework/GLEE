{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves room for you to make concessions if needed.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows that you are serious about selling to Bob but also that you value your product. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's not even close to my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."

Bob's offer:

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm not willing to sell below $1,000,000, so I will counteroffer again."
