"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,100,000. This still leaves you a good margin for profit, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
