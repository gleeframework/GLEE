Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a significant markup over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This allows for potential negotiation and still leaves me with a healthy profit.
* I'm taking a risk by setting a high price, as there's a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for a larger profit outweighs the risk of only selling to John for $1,000,000. 
* I'm hoping that Bob values the product higher than $1,500,000 and will be willing to pay. If not, I still have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum price."
