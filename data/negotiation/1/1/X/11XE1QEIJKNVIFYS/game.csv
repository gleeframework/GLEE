"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $25000. What are your thoughts?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is around $12000. Would you be willing to come down to $15000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $20000? This is my final offer for now.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $20000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $17000.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit. How about we discuss $18500? This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to move forward with the sale.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $18500. I'm very close to my budget, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $17000. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $17750? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",17750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $18375? This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",18375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $18375 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to close the deal now if we can agree on $18000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction.",18000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to make one final offer: $18500. If this doesn't work for you, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",18500.0,Alice,9,
