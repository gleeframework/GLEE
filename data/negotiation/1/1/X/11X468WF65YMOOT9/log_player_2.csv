# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your price point, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise. I'm offering $1,600,000.  Let me know if this works for you.
