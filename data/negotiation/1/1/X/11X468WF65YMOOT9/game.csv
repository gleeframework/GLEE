"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your price point, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise. I'm offering $1,600,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,600,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? That's a fair offer and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
