Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $100. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $100 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below your minimum ($120). 
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts, you make a $20 profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price leaves some wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Alternative Secured:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're covered with John's guaranteed purchase at $120."
