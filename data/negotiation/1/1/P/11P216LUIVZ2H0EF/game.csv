"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $70, but I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to cover my costs. ",80.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $80. I'm willing to meet you at $78, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",78.0,Bob,6,
