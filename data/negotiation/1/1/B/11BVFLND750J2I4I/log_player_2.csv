"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you're interested in! I'm asking for $90 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
The product is only worth $80 to you, and Alice's starting offer is $90. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we aim to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Within Budget:** The offer of $70 keeps us well below our $80 maximum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $90 to $85, showing some willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still above your $80 maximum. You have room to counteroffer again before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $75, we're proposing a price directly in between her counteroffer ($85) and our previous offer ($70). This common negotiation tactic can signal fairness.
* **Still Below Budget:**  $75 keeps us below our maximum budget, leaving a small margin in case Alice is willing to negotiate slightly further.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone encourages continued negotiation."
