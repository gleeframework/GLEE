"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget.  We can always buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's offer but is still a profitable price for her. It leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price well below our alternative option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a profitable transaction. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but $850,000 is still above our budget and our fallback option. We'll reject and counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

We are aiming for a price that is roughly in the middle of the previous offer and counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving while demonstrating willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial asking price.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met our ideal price. There's no point in negotiating further or risking losing the deal by pushing for a lower amount."
