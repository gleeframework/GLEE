Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we start the conversation a bit lower,  would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $600,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Could you consider $1,900,000? This reflects a substantial reduction on my part, while acknowledging the value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we are still quite far apart.  To be frank,  $1,900,000 is not a price point I can meet. Would you be open to something closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but are still a ways off from a price we can both agree on. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute maximum price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  Therefore, the best decision is to sell the product to John."
