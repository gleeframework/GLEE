"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $120. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This will hopefully encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price we are both happy with.  I'm also setting the stage for a friendly negotiation by expressing confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $100. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground while still staying above my minimum value. I'm expressing a willingness to compromise, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it provides. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with John's offer.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and successful deal without risking further negotiation."
