"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we compromise at $110? It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $120",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not there yet.  If you're willing to come down to $100, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to consider my other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting close to your limit, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $112.50? It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it",112.5,Alice,7,
