"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here.  How about $9,250?  It's closer to your price, but still allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
