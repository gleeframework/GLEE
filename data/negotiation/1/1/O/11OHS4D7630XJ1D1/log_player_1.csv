Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,475,000? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach our minimum threshold of $1,500,000 in the remaining rounds.  John offers a guaranteed sale at our desired price. It makes the most financial sense to secure the guaranteed sale with John rather than risk Bob not reaching our minimum price."
