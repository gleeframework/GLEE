"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can go as high as $120. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but how about $105? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. How about $98? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",98.0,Bob,4,
