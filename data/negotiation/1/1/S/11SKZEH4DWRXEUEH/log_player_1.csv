Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, but still below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to make a counteroffer, while also showing that you're not willing to give the product away for cheap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $120. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below the desired price range.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but how about $105? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. How about $98? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $98 is still below my initial goal, it's significantly better than selling to John for $80.  At this point, further negotiation might not yield a substantially higher offer, so accepting is the best option to maximize profit."
