"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell we both see the value in this deal.  What if we settle at $800,000?  That's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,6,
