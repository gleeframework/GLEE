"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. This product is valuable, but I have other options to consider. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have other options, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
