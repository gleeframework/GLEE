"I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $900000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a fair price given the value it brings.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1050000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1000000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. It's the best I can do. Let me know your final decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
