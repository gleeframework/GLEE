Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price is still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This product offers you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This allows me to feel comfortable with the deal while still providing you a great value."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

We're still a ways off from my bottom line, and I'm willing to bet Bob can go higher.  Let's see if we can push him a bit further."
