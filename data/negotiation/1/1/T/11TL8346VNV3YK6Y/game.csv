"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value proposition, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, even considering the potential profit you could make. ",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price is still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This allows me to feel comfortable with the deal while still providing you a great value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? This would be my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
