"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value proposition, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, even considering the potential profit you could make.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget, and you can definitely negotiate a better price.  It's worthwhile to see if you can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price is still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness about negotiating and demonstrating that you're not just playing around.
* **Still Above Alice's Value:**  $950,000 is still $150,000 above Alice's perceived value, giving her some room to bargain but also indicating a strong starting point for you. 
* **Within Your Budget:**  This price is well within your budget, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This allows me to feel comfortable with the deal while still providing you a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my ideal range.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can get closer to my preferred price.  I want to make sure I get the best possible deal without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but not giving away too much.
* **Still Within Budget:** This price is still significantly below my maximum budget, leaving room for potential concessions if necessary.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to Alice, reminding her that she's still getting a good deal even at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, so rejecting it would risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Close to My Target:**  $1,000,000 is closer to my ideal price range and a significant savings compared to buying from John.  
* **Reasonable Compromise:** This price represents a reasonable compromise, allowing both of us to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.

While I'd prefer a slightly lower price, the risk of losing this deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential benefit of further negotiation. It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
