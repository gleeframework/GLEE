"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and my initial offer of $10000. How about $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $11500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $12800? This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,7,
