"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $1800000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1400000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm prepared to go up to $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's aim for a swift agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe the product's value is worth more than what you're offering, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
