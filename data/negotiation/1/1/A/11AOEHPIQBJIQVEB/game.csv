"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12500. This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference at $11250?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
