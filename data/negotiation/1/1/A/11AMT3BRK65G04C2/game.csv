"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept for this product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $11,500? That's my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $11,500 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm firm on $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal! ",10000.0,Bob,6,
