"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll counteroffer at $12500. This is a fair price that still leaves some room for negotiation, but also reflects the product's true value.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth $15000 to me, but I can assure you that it's not. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $12500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $12500, so I'll counteroffer at $11250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11250. I'll counteroffer at $13000. This is a price that's closer to my minimum, but still a bit more flexible than my initial offer. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, as I'm really interested in the product.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'll make one final counteroffer at $13500. This is a price that's still a bit higher than my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to find a deal. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,9,
