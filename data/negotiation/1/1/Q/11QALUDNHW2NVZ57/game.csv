"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get the product for a little less. Would you consider $9000? That would make it a really great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $9500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
