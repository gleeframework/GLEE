Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value and my need to sell it quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm. It acknowledges Bob's potential interest and sets a reasonable expectation for a quick deal. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Get the negotiation started:**  A clear and direct offer initiates the process.
* **Maximize profit:** $12,000 is a good starting point, potentially leaving room for some negotiation, while still being above Bob's perceived value.
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response or choose to sell to John for my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your promptness. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss.  Rejecting his offer allows me to explore a counteroffer or choose to sell to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is below what I need to sell it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to accept $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it's the best I can do at this time.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting its significance and my flexibility.
* **Open for Discussion:** The message ends with an invitation to discuss, encouraging Bob to consider my proposal.

This strategy aims to:

* **Explore a middle ground:**  The counteroffer demonstrates my desire for a deal while maintaining a profit margin.
* **Increase chances of acceptance:** The $11,000 price point is a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Stay prepared:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I have the option to sell to John or make another counteroffer, depending on the circumstances."
