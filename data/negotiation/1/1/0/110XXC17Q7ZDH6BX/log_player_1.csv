Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is firmly rooted below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Accepting his final offer at $1,225,000 means losing out on a potential $75,000 profit.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most logical choice at this point."
