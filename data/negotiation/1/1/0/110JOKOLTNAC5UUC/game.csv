"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This allows for a healthy profit margin for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant, and $1,000,000 undervalues it considerably. I could consider a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be closer to the product's true value. How about $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
