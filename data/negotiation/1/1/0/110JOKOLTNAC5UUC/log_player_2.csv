You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant, and $1,000,000 undervalues it considerably. I could consider a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, we can still try to squeeze a little more out of Alice.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth attempting to get a price closer to $1,100,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to be closer to the product's true value. How about $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer.  This price is within my budget and is still a better deal than buying from John. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'd be left with only John's overpriced option. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product at a reasonable price."
