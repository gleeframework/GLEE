"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, considering your profit margin and my budget.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
