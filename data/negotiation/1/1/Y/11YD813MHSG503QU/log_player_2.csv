"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can definitely get a better price than $10,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering your budget.  It's also a reasonable compromise, as you're only paying $1,500 more than your initial counteroffer.  Accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
