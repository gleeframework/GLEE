Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $10,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000). This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially negotiate a higher price if Bob counteroffers. 

Remember, you can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, considering your profit margin and my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $8,500 is more than John's offer, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob. You can make a counteroffer closer to your original price, seeing if you can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
