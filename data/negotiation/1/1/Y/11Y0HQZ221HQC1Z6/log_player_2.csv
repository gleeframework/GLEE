"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above his own maximum budget. This shows his willingness to negotiate while keeping the price within a reasonable range. The hope is that Alice will see the potential of a deal and be willing to lower her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate offers the potential for a lower price. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer slightly to $900,000. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate, but also shows that he's still aiming for a significant discount. This offer is a compromise, potentially appealing to Alice as it's closer to her previous offer while still being within a range where Bob can potentially make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of a lengthy negotiation process is increasing.  Buying from John guarantees a price within Bob's budget and avoids further potential delays or disagreements with Alice."
