Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, and it's still a good deal for me since the product is worth at least $80 to me. I'm confident I can get a better price than $80 from Bob, but I'm also open to negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I think I can still do better with Bob. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it shows that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $90 is a good price for me, considering I'm guaranteed $80 from John. I'm happy with this outcome."
