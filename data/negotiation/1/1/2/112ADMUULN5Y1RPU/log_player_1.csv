**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally moving towards a more reasonable price. However, we are still significantly above our minimum acceptable price and have room to negotiate. Holding firm now might encourage him to offer closer to the $1 million mark in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last two offers. How about $1,000,000 even? This reflects a fair price that acknowledges both the product's value and my desire to close this deal today.
