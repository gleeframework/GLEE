{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **""Unique product"":**  This is vague but hints at potential value. It's important to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much information about the product's worth to me. 

This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  See if he's even willing to entertain a high price. 
* **Establish a starting point for negotiation:**  Having a starting point allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher final price. 

Remember, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $15000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not desperate to sell. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price.  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to go a little higher than $15,000, especially if he's truly interested in the product. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Signal that I'm not desperate:** This could make Bob more willing to negotiate.
* **See if he'll counter again:**  He might come up with a higher price if he's serious about buying.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $17,500.  This reflects the unique features of the product, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique features to justify the slightly higher price. 
* **Fairness:** Emphasizing fairness helps build trust and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

By taking a slightly more flexible approach, I'm hoping to reach an agreement with Bob while still getting a better price than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $17500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $16250?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $16,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether.

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Potential for lost opportunity:** There's no guarantee that further negotiations will yield a better result.  Bob might be unwilling to go higher, and I could end up with nothing.
* **Time and effort:**  The back-and-forth negotiation is taking time and effort. It's a good time to accept a reasonable offer and move on.
* **Safety net:**  Even though $16,250 is less than my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John for $15,000.

This decision prioritizes securing a sale while still ensuring a decent profit."
