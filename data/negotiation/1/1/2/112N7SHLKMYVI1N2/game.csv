"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $15000 for it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $17500.  This reflects the unique features of the product, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this price.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $16250?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",16250.0,Bob,4,
