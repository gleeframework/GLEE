"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is under your $10,000 maximum, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and find a better deal. This might encourage Alice to come back with a lower price. Even if she doesn't, you always have John's offer of $10,000."
