"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 is considerably below its true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,325,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, but I think that's the maximum I can go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation.  I'm willing to accept $1,280,000. This is my final offer.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,280,000, which is $1,265,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",1265000.0,Bob,6,
