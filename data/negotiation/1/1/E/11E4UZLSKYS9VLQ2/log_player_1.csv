"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 is considerably below its true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,325,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, but I think that's the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and his offers are steadily increasing. While $1,250,000 is a good offer, we still have negotiating room and time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation.  I'm willing to accept $1,280,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1280000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer to John's offer, so it's time to apply pressure.  By stating this is our final offer, Bob might feel this is his last chance to get a deal before we walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,280,000, which is $1,265,000. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,265,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,265,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is meeting us in the middle and while it's not the final offer we presented,  $1,265,000 is a strong profit. Holding out for more risks losing Bob entirely, and having to accept John's lower offer."
