"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which holds immense value for you at $1,000,000. I understand its importance and would like to offer it to you at a special price. My proposal is to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an item that could potentially be worth even more in the future. I look forward to your positive response. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can do better. You know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000. There's a chance Alice might lower her price further in a subsequent offer to avoid losing the sale."
