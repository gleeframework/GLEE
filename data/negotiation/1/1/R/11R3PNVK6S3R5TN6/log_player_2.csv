"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer from Alice ($1,150,000) is above her valuation ($1,000,000), it's still significantly lower than John's price ($1,200,000). Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $50,000, making it the most financially beneficial option."
