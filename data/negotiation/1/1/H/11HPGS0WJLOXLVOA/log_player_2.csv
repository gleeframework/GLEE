{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Alice is getting closer, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $8,500 is the highest I can go. If that works for you, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

I'm getting closer to my limit, so I'm making a smaller counter-offer and setting a firm but polite boundary.  This keeps the negotiation moving but lets Alice know I'm serious."
