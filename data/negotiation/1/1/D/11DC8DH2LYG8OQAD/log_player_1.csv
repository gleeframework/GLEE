Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,400,000 is below my minimum, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,400,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,550,000?  It's a fair price, and we can close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,450,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,450,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $1,500,000.  If it doesn't work, I'll go with John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,500,000 is your minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I've already gone down to my absolute minimum price, and I don't see any room for further negotiation.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get the price I'm looking for."
