"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,400,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,550,000?  It's a fair price, and we can close this deal today.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,450,000. Can you consider that?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm seeing your commitment to getting this deal done, and I appreciate that. Let's meet in the middle one last time. I'll come down to $1,500,000, my absolute minimum. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to secure a valuable product. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,500,000 is your minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,475,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1475000.0,Bob,6,
