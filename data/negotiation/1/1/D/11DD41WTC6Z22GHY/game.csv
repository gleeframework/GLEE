"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your counter offer. While I appreciate you moving a bit,  $9000 is still a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. Considering the product's value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to make one more concession.
