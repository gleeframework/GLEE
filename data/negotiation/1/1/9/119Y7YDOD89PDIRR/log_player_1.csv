"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it's within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, given the value of the product to him.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than the value of the product to him, and it's also below our minimum acceptable price.  We'll counter with a higher price to see if we can bridge the gap. We're not ready to sell to John yet because we could potentially get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer moves towards Bob's offer, but it's still above our minimum.  We're trying to find a middle ground and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1050000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $950000. It's a fair price that's closer to our respective values. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, it's still below our desired price. We're not ready to sell to John yet because we could potentially get more from Bob.  We'll counter again to try and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is closer, but I need to be at least $1,000,000 to make this work for me.   Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000 - this ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

We're sticking to our minimum price here, as this is the point where selling to John becomes a viable option. We're also emphasizing a fair deal for both parties to encourage Bob to accept."
