""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $11,000.  Let me know what you think."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $8,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Profit Maximization:**  You want to capture as much of the difference between Bob's value and your minimum as possible. 
* **The Offer:** Offering the product at $11,000 leaves Bob with a potential gain of $1,000, making it likely he'll accept.  This price also nets you a $3,000 profit over your guaranteed sale."
