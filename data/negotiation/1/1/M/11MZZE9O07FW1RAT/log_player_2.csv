# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

This counter-offer aims to start the negotiation close to Alice's value for the product. It's a reasonable starting point while still leaving room for me to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming for a price closer to $10,000."

This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $12,500, but I really think it's worth more than that. If you're willing to meet me at $12,500, I'm willing to sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Alice seems to be increasing her price now, moving further away from a reasonable deal. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
