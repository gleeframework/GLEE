"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I believe the product offers significant value at $13,500, I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. How about we settle on $11,750? ",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm getting closer, but $11,750 is still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $10,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand where you're coming from, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $10,500 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to agree to $11,000 if that seals the deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're really getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? That would work well for me.",10750.0,Bob,6,
