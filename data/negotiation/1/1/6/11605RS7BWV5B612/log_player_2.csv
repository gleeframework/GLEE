"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I've priced it at $1,450,000, which I believe reflects its potential.  This is a fair price that allows me to earn a solid profit while still offering you a significant return on your investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,450,000
* **Your maximum price:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John at the same price as your maximum.  You save no money, but you also don't lose any money compared to buying from John."
