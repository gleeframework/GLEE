Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $149. I believe it's a great deal and would be happy to answer any questions you might have."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it implies value by mentioning a ""great deal."" This might make Bob more receptive than a barebones offer. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob outright rejects an offer close to $150. However, this strategy prioritizes potentially earning the most profit. If you want to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, you could lower the initial offer, but that would decrease your potential profit."
