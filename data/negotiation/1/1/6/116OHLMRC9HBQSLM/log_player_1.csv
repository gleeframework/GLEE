{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  We've reached a point in the negotiation where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal. It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid potentially losing more time and energy in further negotiations."
