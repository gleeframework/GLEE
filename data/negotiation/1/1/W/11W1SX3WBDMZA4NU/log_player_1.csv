Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000,  we don't want to start too low. There's room to negotiate down.
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer anchors the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it, it sets a reference point for counter-offers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a ""deal"" while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **John as a Backup:** The guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000 provides Alice with a strong fallback position, giving her leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
