Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll only accept an offer at or below that price.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential ""win-win"" zone between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price in this range would benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin the negotiation above Bob's perceived value to give yourself room to negotiate down.
2. **Justification:** Offer a brief, plausible reason for the high price (without revealing John's guaranteed offer). 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it will deliver significant value. My initial offer is $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's positive, emphasizes value, and sets a strong initial price. 
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's value.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can gradually reduce your price, but never go below $1,500,000.
* **Walk Away Power:** If Bob isn't willing to meet a price that's beneficial for you, be prepared to walk away and sell to John."
