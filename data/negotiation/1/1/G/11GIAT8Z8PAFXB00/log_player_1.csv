"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to start with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Being open to negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to hearing your thoughts,"" I'm signaling that I'm willing to discuss the price. 
* **No mention of John:**  I don't want to reveal John's offer to Bob, as it might make him less willing to negotiate.

This first offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I need to see if we can find a middle ground.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John is still an option:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option if the negotiations with Bob fail, but I want to explore the negotiation further before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the sale while giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I emphasize that I'm making a compromise to show that I'm flexible and trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Staying firm on my minimum:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below $13,000 at this point. 

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We're getting closer, but I'm not ready to give in to Bob's offer. I'll continue negotiating.
* **John is still an option:**  John's offer remains a safety net if these negotiations fail, but I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, and I'm willing to go a little further. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $11,250?  That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's still within your budget."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This demonstrates a strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing the compromise:** I highlight that this is a ""significant compromise"" to emphasize my willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above my minimum:** While I'm willing to go lower, $11,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

This counteroffer shows continued willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. I'm ready to make a final offer: $10,250. This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  I need to weigh the risk of losing the deal with Bob against the possibility of getting a better offer in the next round. 
* **Potential for a counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum. 

I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations, as I believe there's a chance of a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and we're getting close. However, I still need to be at a price that reflects the value of the product.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000? It's just a small increase from your last offer, but it would make this a very worthwhile deal for me."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  The offer is only $750 more than Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible but not cave in entirely. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, justifying the higher price.
* **""Worthwhile Deal"":**  This phrase implies that if we agree, it would be a good outcome for both of us.

This counteroffer continues to push for a higher price while demonstrating willingness to compromise. It might encourage Bob to accept, considering the small gap between our offers."
