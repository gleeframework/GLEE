"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would allow me to move forward with the sale while giving you a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, and I'm willing to go a little further. However, $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $11,250?  That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's still within your budget.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. I'm ready to make a final offer: $10,250. This is a fair compromise and lets us both walk away happy. What do you say?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and we're getting close. However, I still need to be at a price that reflects the value of the product.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000? It's just a small increase from your last offer, but it would make this a very worthwhile deal for me.",11000.0,Alice,7,
