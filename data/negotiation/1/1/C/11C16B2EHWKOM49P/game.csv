"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $135. Let's split the difference and make a deal.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $135 just isn't enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $142.50.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",142.5,Alice,5,
