{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I've chosen $15,000 because it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how much I'm willing to risk to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still be willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is certainly a fair offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?  It's still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $12500, so I'm offering $11250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,250 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and a good price given Bob's willingness to negotiate.  Selling to John for $10,000 would be less profitable, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob's interest entirely."
