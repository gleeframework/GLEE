This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down if needed, but it's still lower than my minimum value, ensuring I profit. I'm also being friendly and encouraging a response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value than his initial offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, which would be $9,250. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further, and I'm getting tired of this back and forth. At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000. It's a better deal for me, and I can avoid further negotiation."
