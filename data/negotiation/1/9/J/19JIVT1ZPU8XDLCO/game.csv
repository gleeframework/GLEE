"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $13,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think we can work out a deal that's fair to both of us.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is still within a reasonable range for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,250. This is really my maximum, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
