"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your specific needs. We believe it could be a valuable asset to your endeavors. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it provides, we're extending an exclusive offer for you to purchase this product at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating further, especially considering he has 10 rounds. Buying from John right away would be a significant overpayment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, reflecting the value I see in it and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, we would like to extend a counteroffer for the product at $1,000,000. This price reflects the value we place on maintaining a strong relationship with you while also ensuring our business interests are met. We hope this proposal aligns better with your current financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, which gives him ample opportunity to push for a lower price. Buying from John would be a significant overpayment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given our discussions so far, I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which represents a significant compromise for me.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our desire to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. We value the opportunity to work with you and understand your financial considerations. Based on our previous discussions, we propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. This price reflects our commitment to finding a solution that works for both parties while allowing us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you are looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and is within his budget.  While he could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will raise the price again or the deal will fall apart.  With 5 rounds left, Bob has a good chance of securing the product at a reasonable price.  Buying from John would be a huge overpayment."
