Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below the value this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $750,000 is a significant amount, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to move, and I believe we can still reach a price closer to my target.  We're still above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you drive a hard bargain! I understand your budget constraints, but let's aim for a win-win. How about $825,000? That reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your position."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has met my lowest acceptable price.  While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, it's not worth the risk of him walking away or the time cost of further negotiation.  This is a fair deal."
