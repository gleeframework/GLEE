"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic:**  I'm aiming for a price that would be ideal for me, but I'm also prepared to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $13,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **High Enough to Maintain Profit:** $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $15,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a slightly better offer from Bob.
* **Potential for compromise:** I want to see if I can convince Bob to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. This still gives you a significant savings on the value of the product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I've reached my minimum acceptable price, so I'm making a firm offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why this is a good deal for him. 
* **Final offer tone:** I'm communicating that this is likely my final offer, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Can we make a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is a safe bet:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Limited time:**  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially lose a more lucrative deal."
