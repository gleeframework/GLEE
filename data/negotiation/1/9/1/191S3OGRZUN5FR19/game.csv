"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on a lower price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can offer you a compromise at $14000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $13000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer you a final compromise at $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet on this price, as I really need this product.",13000.0,Bob,6,
