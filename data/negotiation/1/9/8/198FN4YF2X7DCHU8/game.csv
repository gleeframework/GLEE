"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a bit higher than I'm willing to go.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $750000. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm willing to meet you at $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
