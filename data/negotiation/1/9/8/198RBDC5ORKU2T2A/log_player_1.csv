Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $14,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Profitable:** It's a $1,000 profit over John's offer. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk him walking away entirely."
