"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? That's the best I can do.,127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $127.50 is close, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price.  Let's try $129.  It's just a small step up, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of this product.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $129 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
