"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than her initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with John."
