"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $12,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",9500.0,Alice,3,
