"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since Alice is open to it.  You can see if you can get a lower price before committing to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to do $7,500? I'm serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my price range."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget constraint. I can't go as low as $7500 but I'm willing to come down to $9000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, you can likely still get a better deal. You should try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $8,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the most I can realistically offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
