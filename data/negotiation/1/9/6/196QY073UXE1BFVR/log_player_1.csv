Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, but I'm open to negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, or if he's going to lowball me. If he rejects, I'll counter based on his offer and keep in mind the option of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to earn at least $150 for the product. I'm going to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a good price for both of us, as it's a good deal for you and I can still make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While $125 is closer, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a sale to John for a higher price.  It's better to secure a sale at my target price than to keep negotiating with Bob and potentially lose both."
