"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $120, which is a good deal, but you can likely do better. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will counter, but it's a good starting point to see if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price to $125, which is still better than John's price of $150, but not as good as her original $120 offer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can get her closer to my previous counteroffer of $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer of $125.  It's likely Alice will counter again, but hopefully, we can come to a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price again to $130, which is closer to my previous offer of $110. While I prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate. It's important to remember that John is selling the same product for $150. Accepting Alice's offer of $130 still gets me a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product altogether."
