"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer.  There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
