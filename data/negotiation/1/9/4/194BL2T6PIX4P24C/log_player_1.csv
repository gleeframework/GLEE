{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $10,000. This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob."
