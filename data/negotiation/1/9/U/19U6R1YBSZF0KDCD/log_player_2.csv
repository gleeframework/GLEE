"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us. You get a valuable product at a price that's below market value, and I get a quick sale.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,000,000 is still above his maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for $800,000.  He has room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This still gives you a significant discount and ensures we both get a good outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, trying to get closer to his target price.  He can still purchase from John for $800,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $900000 is closer to where I need to be, but I still need a bit more to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $925000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $925,000 is within his budget and is a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart, and he may end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
