I'm starting with a much lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."

We're getting close!  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if I can get it closer to $140."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you drive a hard bargain! How about $140, and we have a deal?"",
