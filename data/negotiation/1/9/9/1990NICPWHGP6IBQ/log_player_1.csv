Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good starting point, allowing for some negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is a decent price, I'm going to try and get closer to my initial target.  I'll counter with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $92 is only slightly lower than my counteroffer of $95. It's getting close to my initial target, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for $80."
