"Alice,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1300000, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
