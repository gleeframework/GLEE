Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a steal at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."",
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $100 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $99 is our initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate down a little, getting us closer to his $80 valuation.  
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not revealing we have another buyer, Bob might feel compelled to act quickly if he's interested. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
