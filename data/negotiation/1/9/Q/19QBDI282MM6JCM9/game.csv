"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product! However,  $11,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Would you be open to that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still very enthusiastic about this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to take another step closer to your price, though. How about we try $10,900? That's the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $10,900 is definitely getting closer, but my budget is firm at $10,000.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher.  Would you be willing to accept that? ",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I've already gone quite far to try to meet you halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we try $10,200? That's the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $10,200 is still a little more than I can manage.  As I said, $10,000 is my absolute limit.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to explore other options. ",10000.0,Bob,8,
