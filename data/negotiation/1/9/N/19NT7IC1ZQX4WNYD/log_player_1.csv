Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110?  It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $105 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John.  It's time to close this deal!"
