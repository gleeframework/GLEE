"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $175 is far above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum price point of $100.  This gives Alice room to negotiate, but also clearly establishes my budget. If she rejects this offer, I'll have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  I know I can get the product for $100 from John, so I have some leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between my maximum price of $100 and Alice's latest offer of $125. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still have a firm price point. If Alice rejects, I can always buy from John for $100."
