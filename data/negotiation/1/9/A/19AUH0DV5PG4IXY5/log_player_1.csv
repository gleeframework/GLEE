"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:** Using a friendly message builds rapport and can make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $120 allows for some wiggle room in case Bob wants to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if I can get close to the $150 value the product holds for Bob. I'm also prepared to drop the price a bit in subsequent rounds if needed. However, I'll always keep my minimum price of $80 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still High:**  While Bob's offer is lower than my initial ask, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if I can find a middle ground. If Bob continues to refuse, I'll gradually lower my counteroffer in subsequent rounds while monitoring my minimum price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm counteroffering at $110, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and positive helps to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlight Fairness:** By mentioning that the price is ""fair for both of us,"" I'm subtly emphasizing the value proposition and hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to inch closer to the $150 value the product holds for Bob while still staying above my minimum price of $80. By making a reasonable counteroffer and emphasizing a fair price, I hope to reach an agreement in the next round."
