The product is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Let's start with a strong counteroffer at your maximum budget. This shows Alice you're serious about buying but also sets a clear limit."

We've been negotiating for a while, and Alice isn't budging much. At this point, it's better to cut our losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed price and saves us a lot of time and potential frustration."
