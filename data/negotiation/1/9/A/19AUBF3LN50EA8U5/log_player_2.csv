"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $8,000, suggesting she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt a better counter-offer from Alice, getting you closer to her valuation. If her counter-offer is still too high, you can always buy from John for $12,000."
