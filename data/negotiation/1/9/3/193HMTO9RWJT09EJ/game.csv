"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am not able to meet the price of $1,800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I still feel that $1,650,000 is slightly above my budget. I would like to make one last counteroffer at $1,600,000. I hope this proposal works for you.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
