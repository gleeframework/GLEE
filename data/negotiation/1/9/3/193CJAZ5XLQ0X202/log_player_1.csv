Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest in a range that's slightly more cost-effective for my business. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product. This would still allow me to acquire it while staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
