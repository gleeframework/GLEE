Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Appeal to Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it slightly below John's price ($1,200,000) creates a sense of a good deal for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a faster sale. 

By starting high but still offering a price that's potentially appealing to Bob, we maximize our chances of a profitable and swift sale."
