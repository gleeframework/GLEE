"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer,  $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, while still reflecting the product's value to me. I'm confident I can get at least $1,200,000 from John if I need to, so I have some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000, or even higher, by continuing the negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair, as it's closer to the value of the product for both of us.  I'm hoping this compromise will entice Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm running out of time, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to take the risk of losing the deal with Bob, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,150,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to get Bob to agree to a deal. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm confident I can secure a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can get a better offer by continuing the negotiation. I'm aware that time is running out, but I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to secure a better price.  The option to sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me some confidence in continuing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,125,000.  This is a smaller reduction from my last offer, showing that I'm getting closer to meeting Bob's price.  I'm hoping that this compromise will convince him to accept the deal.  With only a few rounds left, I need to start considering the possibility of a deal with Bob over the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale to John. With only two rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will budge significantly.  I'm not comfortable accepting his offer at $1,050,000.  It's better to take the sure thing and get $1,200,000 from John.  I've learned a lot about negotiation during this process and will apply those lessons in the future."
