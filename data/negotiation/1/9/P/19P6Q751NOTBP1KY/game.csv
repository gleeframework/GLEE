"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,350,000? I believe this still represents significant value for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  My final offer is $1,300,000.  This is a firm price, but I hope it demonstrates my sincerity in wanting to work with you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll make the purchase. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
