"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This is a reasonable starting point that demonstrates your willingness to compromise while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is still above your maximum budget. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of continuing is high. If you reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and you might end up with a worse deal than buying from John for $800,000.  

It's better to secure the product at a known price from John rather than risk further negotiation and potentially paying more."
