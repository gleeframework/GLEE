"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but that price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $950000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my initial investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering a price of $1062500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1062500.0,Alice,5,
