Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $9,500 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message highlights the perceived value for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** By leaving room for negotiation, you allow for the possibility of finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Plan B:** Remember, you have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you can still secure your minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can try to negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still provides you with a good deal considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is closer to my minimum price of $10,000 and shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize value again:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Maintain leverage:** The counteroffer keeps the possibility of selling to John open if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **One more counteroffer:** I can try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.
* **John is my fallback:** Selling to John is always an option if negotiations with Bob continue to fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm committed to making this work, I can't go lower than $9,250. This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final counteroffer:** This is my last counteroffer before considering selling to John. 
* **Meeting halfway (again):** The price is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I use phrases like ""committed to making this work"" and ""find a solution"" to show that I am trying to be reasonable.
* **Setting a deadline:** Implying this is my final offer increases the pressure on Bob to accept."
