"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $10,800? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $10,800 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,200.  Would that work for you?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $10,500. That's the lowest I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we compromise at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
