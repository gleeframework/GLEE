"I have a unique opportunity to sell you a rare product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000. Would that be feasible?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. Is that a price you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try $10,000? That's a significant compromise from my original offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000. How about we compromise at $11,500? That's a fair price for a product of this quality, and it's still a good deal for you",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $10,750?  This is a small step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. How about we meet at $11,250? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable",11250.0,Alice,7,
