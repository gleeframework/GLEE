"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This would be a fair price considering the product's potential and my willingness to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not ready to sell it for $1200000 just yet. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also giving you a good profit. I'm confident we can close the deal quickly at this price. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not ready to sell it for $1050000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1080000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
