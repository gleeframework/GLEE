,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. This product is worth a lot, and I'm confident I can find another buyer who will pay that price. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
