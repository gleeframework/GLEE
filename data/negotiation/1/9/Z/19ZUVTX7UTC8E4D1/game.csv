"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially pricing it at $18,000.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget though. This product would be really useful for me, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I could be persuaded to go down to $11,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $11,000 is still a little high for me. How about we settle at $8,000? That's the absolute top of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,6,
