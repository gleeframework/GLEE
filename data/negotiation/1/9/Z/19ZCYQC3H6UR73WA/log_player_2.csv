"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is less than the maximum you're willing to pay, you can potentially get a better deal.  By rejecting, you open the door to negotiation and might be able to secure a price closer to Alice's value of $80."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal, considering my maximum budget of $150.  While further negotiation might yield a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower.  Accepting at $110 saves me $40 compared to buying from John."
