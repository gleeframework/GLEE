Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm confident the product is worth more to him than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $100 to him."
