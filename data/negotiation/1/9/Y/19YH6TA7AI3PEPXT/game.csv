"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",90.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I'm willing to make a decision soon, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle a bit more.",95.0,Bob,4,
