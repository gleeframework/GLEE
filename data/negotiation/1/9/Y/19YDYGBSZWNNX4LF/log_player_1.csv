I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, $12,000.  I know Bob values the product less, but I'm hoping he'll see the value and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I still need to make a decent profit. $11,000 seems like a fair compromise."
