Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's within Bob's range:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, this offer is within his potential range.
* **It's a strong opening:** A high initial offer demonstrates confidence in your product's value and encourages Bob to seriously consider the purchase. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings, but you also want to avoid a stalemate with Bob.  If he rejects the offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still below the initial offer of $950,000 and leaves less room for potential profit. It's worthwhile to continue the negotiation and see if a higher price can be achieved.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Send a counteroffer:**  You can propose a price closer to your initial offer, perhaps $925,000. This demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate but are also committed to getting a good price.
* **Gain information:** By observing Bob's reaction to your counteroffer, you can assess his willingness to pay and adjust your strategy accordingly. 
* **Avoid selling to John:** This strategy gives you a higher chance of getting a better price than John's offer of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's proposal. Here's why:

* **Compromise:**  It shows you are willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain value:** It keeps the price above your minimum, ensuring you don't lose out on potential profit.
* **Increase chances of acceptance:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's counteroffer, you increase the likelihood that he'll accept, leading to a successful sale. 

Remember, the goal is to secure the highest possible price, but also to avoid getting stuck in a long negotiation loop. Be prepared to adjust your counteroffers depending on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's wise to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your goal:** $920,000 is very close to your initial asking price of $950,000 and significantly above your minimum of $800,000.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even a lower price. 
* **Secure the deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

While a few thousand dollars more could be tempting, it's important to balance potential profit with the likelihood of success and the time invested in negotiation."
