"I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That way we both get closer to what we're looking for.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Can you meet me at this price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again, at $90. This would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to go up to $88. Can we meet at this price?",88.0,Bob,6,
