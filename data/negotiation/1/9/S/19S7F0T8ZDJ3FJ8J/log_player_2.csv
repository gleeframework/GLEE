"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds.**  There's no need to rush into a deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, demonstrating your seriousness about saving money. However, it's still above Alice's minimum value ($8,000), making it a plausible starting point.
* **Setting the Stage:** This counteroffer also sets the expectation for future negotiations. You're willing to pay a fair price, but you're not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this unique item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

* **You're not in a hurry.**  You have several rounds remaining, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's not beneficial to you."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price.**  $12,000 is within your budget, and a significant improvement from previous offers.
* **Time is running out.** You only have 3 rounds left before having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **You have a good chance of getting an even better deal.** You can always counteroffer again in the next round, but running the risk of needing to buy from John isn't worth it at this point.

By accepting this offer, you secure the product at a price you're comfortable with and avoid the higher price from John."
