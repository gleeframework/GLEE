"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I have 10 rounds and want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product.  Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my seriousness about negotiating. It also leaves room for potential compromise, as it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product. This strategy aims to establish a lower starting point for further negotiations while showing that I'm actively engaged in finding a solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  To move this forward, I could accept $925,000.  This reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I want to pay. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll continue to reject and counteroffer to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming to gradually decrease the price with each counteroffer.  $900,000 is a reasonable compromise, still above Alice's value but closer to my target. This shows continued negotiation while maintaining a firm position."
