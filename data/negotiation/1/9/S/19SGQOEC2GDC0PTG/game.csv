"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
