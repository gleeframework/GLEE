"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a great price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, which is a good starting point. But, it is still above my budget of $8,000. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the product's value. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$10,500 is still above my budget, but Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll counter with a lower offer, hoping to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and it's closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$9,800 is still more than I want to pay. I'll try to counter with a lower offer, hoping to close the deal at a more favorable price.  I'm also getting closer to my ""walk-away"" point, so I might consider buying from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more wiggle room.  How about $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value to me and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a bit more wiggle room, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9,700. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my ""walk-away"" point. At this stage, with 3 rounds left, I am willing to risk missing out on a potential deal with Alice, especially if itâ€™s a good product and I really want it.  The potential for further negotiation is small, and the time is valuable.  
Buying from John is the safest option to ensure I acquire the product within my budget."
