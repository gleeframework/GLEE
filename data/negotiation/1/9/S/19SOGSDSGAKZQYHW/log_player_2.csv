"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $10,000. This is the best possible price for me, and it's likely below Alice's minimum acceptable price.  However, it sets the negotiation in motion and gives Alice a clear understanding of my limits."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500, which is still above my budget, but much closer to my limit. It's a significant improvement from her previous offer. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she might not budge further, and I might end up buying from John anyway. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price that's reasonably close to my ideal, minimizing my risk."
