**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **The product's value to Alice is irrelevant in this scenario:** The fact that the product is worth $8,000 to Alice doesn't affect Bob's decision. Bob only cares about his own value for the product and the best price he can get."
