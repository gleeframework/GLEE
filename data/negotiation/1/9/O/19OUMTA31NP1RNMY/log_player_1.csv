"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($80) but still below Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum ($80) than my initial offer of $100. While it's tempting to accept, I believe there's still room for a higher price.
* **Room for compromise:** I'm confident that Bob is willing to pay more than $90, given his perceived value of $120. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to $100. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's close this now, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the value of the product to justify my price, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we close the deal now, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $92.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price point, and only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer of $95.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I continue to reject offers, there's a risk that Bob will get frustrated and walk away from the negotiation.
* **Time is running out:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I'm closer to my goal than John's offer of $80, and there's a chance I can get a better deal if I accept and try to negotiate further with Bob in the future. 

Accepting this offer secures a good price and allows me to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob in the future, if the opportunity arises."
