Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's close this now, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go to $92.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
