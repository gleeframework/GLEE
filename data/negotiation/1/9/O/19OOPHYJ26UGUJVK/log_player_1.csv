"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic, hoping to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, reminding him why it's worth considering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting. 
* **Potential for Higher:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to pay more than his initial assessment.
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting and counteroffering, I signal that I'm confident in the product's value and that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.  

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than $10,000 but still above Bob's offer, to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's true worth. How about $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin. 
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value and emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to make it more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and collaborative to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am still looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose $9,250 as my final offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowering Offer:** While Bob is showing his interest by negotiating, his offer is now significantly lower than my initial asking price.  
* **Holding Out for More:** I'm not ready to accept this offer, as it's getting closer to my minimum but still doesn't meet my desired profit margin. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially aiming for a price closer to $9,500 to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,250 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you'll get for this product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to find a solution. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I continue to highlight the value of the product, reinforcing Bob's reasons for wanting to buy it. 
* **Urgency:**  I add a sense of urgency (""Let's make this deal happen!"") to encourage Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to test whether Bob is serious about closing the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, but I am still unable to meet your price. My final offer remains at $9,250. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeated his final offer, indicating he's unwilling to budge further.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only four rounds remaining, the potential for a better deal with Bob is dwindling.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $12,000 guarantees a much higher profit than Bob's final offer. 

By selling to John, I secure a significantly better outcome in this negotiation.  While I would have preferred to work with Bob, his unwillingness to compromise makes it clear that a deal with him isn't feasible at this time."
