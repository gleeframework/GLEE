{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**
