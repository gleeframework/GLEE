"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and high demand, I'm initially offering it at $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I could consider letting it go for $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This offer stands as a fair compromise.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, and I appreciate the movement.  How about we split the difference between our last two numbers and call it $12,375? That's my final offer.",12375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,375 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about $11,800? I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",11800.0,Bob,6,
