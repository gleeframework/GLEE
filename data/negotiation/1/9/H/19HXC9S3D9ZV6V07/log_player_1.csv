Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Profit Potential:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 if you can sell to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. Aim for a price that gives you a significant share of the profit while still being appealing to him.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is direct, highlights the product's value, and proposes the price confidently.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 gives you $150,000 above your minimum and leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his alternative.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This offer assumes Bob is a rational actor.  If you suspect he's a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the price to increase the chance of acceptance. 
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more generous offer might be strategic. 

**Remember:** This is just one offer strategy. The optimal approach depends on your assessment of Bob and your priorities."
