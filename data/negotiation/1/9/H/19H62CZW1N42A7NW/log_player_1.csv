I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation room while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'll gauge Bob's reaction to this offer and adjust accordingly."

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price higher than Bob's offer.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come back to his original offer of $1,800,000.  At this point,  I'm comfortable accepting this price. It's significantly higher than my minimum and while I could continue to try and negotiate, there's a risk I could lose the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer."
