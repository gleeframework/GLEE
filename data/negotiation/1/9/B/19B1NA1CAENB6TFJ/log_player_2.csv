"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, starting the negotiation by rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. There's a chance you might be able to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price. You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your $12,000 target."
