Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum value, I believe there's potential to get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than what I would get from John and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  I'll take the deal and move on."
