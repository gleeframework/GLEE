"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's my best offer.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
