{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is slightly above what Bob is willing to pay, but still gives me some profit.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try and counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  It's a sure thing, and it allows me to get my desired price."
