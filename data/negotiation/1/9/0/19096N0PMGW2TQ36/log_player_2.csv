"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a special introductory price of $14,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents an excellent opportunity to secure this high-quality item at a price point that is still significantly above its cost to me while saving you $1,000 compared to its market value. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially save more money. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. Even if she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
