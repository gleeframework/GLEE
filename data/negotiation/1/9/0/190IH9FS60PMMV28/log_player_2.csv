"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. $900,000 is still a significant amount of money, and there's a good chance he can get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He has 9 rounds to work with, so there's plenty of time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting the negotiation aggressively with a significant counteroffer. He is aiming for a price much closer to Alice's value of $800,000, hoping to incentivize Alice to continue negotiations. This move also demonstrates Bob's seriousness and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice is clearly willing to compromise. There's still room to work towards a lower price, and Bob shouldn't give up just yet.  He has 7 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to compromise while still trying to push for a lower price. This counteroffer demonstrates a balanced approach, acknowledging Alice's need to make some profit but also emphasizing Bob's desire for a good deal. He's essentially trying to find a middle ground between their two initial positions, and with 6 rounds left, there's still time for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept this offer.  He's gotten the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer and is now very close to her minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice getting frustrated and refusing to budge further.  Additionally, Bob has already rejected several offers, and with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal becomes higher.  At this point, the benefit of securing the product at a good price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower offer in future rounds."
