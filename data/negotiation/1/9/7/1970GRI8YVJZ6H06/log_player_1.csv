Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is closer to my value than Bob's. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential fit for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, indicating I'm open to a counteroffer if Bob doesn't accept the initial price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can make a counteroffer closer to my target price and see if we can find a middle ground.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and maintain the possibility of getting a higher price.

Selling to John at this point would guarantee me my minimum price, but I still believe there's a chance I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. The product is really important to me, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? It's a significant drop from my original offer, and I think it shows my willingness to work with you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both of us, fostering a sense of collaboration.
* **Justification:**  I provide a justification for the counteroffer, highlighting the importance of the product to me and the significant drop from my initial price.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that is more acceptable to Bob while still securing a price closer to my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both live with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further price reductions and could potentially lead to a lower final price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John at $10,000 guarantees my minimum profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

Given the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of a good price with John, I believe selling to John is the most prudent decision at this point."
