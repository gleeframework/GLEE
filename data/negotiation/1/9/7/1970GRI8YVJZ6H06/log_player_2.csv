"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Reason: You want to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is more than your desired budget. You can always buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiations fail. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you an opportunity to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. The product is really important to me, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? It's a significant drop from my original offer, and I think it shows my willingness to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: While $9,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it is still more than your desired budget of $8,000. You can always buy from John for $8,000, so it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better price."
