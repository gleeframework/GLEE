Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but I also want to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly lower. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, hoping to sway Bob even though his perceived value is lower than my asking price.

**Contingency:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
