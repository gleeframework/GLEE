"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is less than her perceived value, it's still more than your maximum budget of $12,000 and what John is offering. You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
