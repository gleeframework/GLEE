Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle.

Bob is not budging, and I'm nearing my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is a safer option at this point."
