{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, but also shows that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's counteroffer, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  That's fair considering what John is offering.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly what John is offering, and I'm not willing to risk losing a sale and going through more rounds of negotiation. It's a good deal, so I'll accept it."
