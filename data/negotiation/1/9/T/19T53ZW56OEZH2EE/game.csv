"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $11,000 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, considering its value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too far apart on price.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $11,200, but I need to get at least that much to make this worthwhile. I think this price is still a good deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I can do $10,900, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'm willing to make a deal.",10900.0,Bob,6,
