Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $10,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. How about we try $10,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget of $15,000.

While $10,500 is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to hold out for a little longer and see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Bob is stuck on $10,500, and I'm not willing to go that low.  While I'd prefer to make more, selling to John for $8,000 is still better than accepting Bob's offer."
