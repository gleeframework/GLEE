{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a steal for a product worth $1,000,000 to you! Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount while still securing a good profit for me. It also sets a strong initial negotiation point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my target price of $950,000 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $875,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to reach $900,000,  Bob's offer of $875,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and it seems like Bob is unlikely to budge further.  Accepting his offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
