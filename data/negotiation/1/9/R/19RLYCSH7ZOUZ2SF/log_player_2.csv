The product is too expensive at $1,200,000, exceeding your budget. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

I'm offering $900,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation."

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which is closer to Alice's revised price. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential savings compared to buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still slightly above my budget.  While I could try another counteroffer, it's getting close to my limit and there's no guarantee Alice will accept. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll choose to buy it from John for $1,000,000."
