# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to share with you, Bob. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's always best to try and negotiate, especially since you don't know the value of the product to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1050000, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Alice has come down significantly from her original price, and $1,050,000 is a good price for a product you value at $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer allows you to save $150,000 and buy the product without further negotiation."
