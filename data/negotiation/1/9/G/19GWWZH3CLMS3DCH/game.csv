"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price given its value.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and it's a significant discount from the original price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1150000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1100000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value and is a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1200000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
