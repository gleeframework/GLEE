,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product but can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the value we both see in this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer for this round.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000. If you're not willing to come down to this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about $1,750,000?  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a serious offer, and if it's not accepted, I'll need to consider buying from John.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we are getting closer.  I appreciate your move upwards. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, I propose a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its true value and the benefits it offers. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but I'm still hesitant at $1,600,000.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
