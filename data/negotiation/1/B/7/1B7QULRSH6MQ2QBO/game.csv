"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to compromise further and offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise further to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my last offer of $9,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to go with another option.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10,250.
