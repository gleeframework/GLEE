"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his comfortable spending limit.  There's still room for negotiation and a counteroffer is a better strategy than accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to compromise further and offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise further to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation and he should try to get closer to his target price. He can also start considering John's offer as an alternative if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my last offer of $9,500. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting close to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget.  He's still better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate further. With a few more rounds left, there's still a chance to reach a deal closer to his target, and he can also fall back on John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to go with another option."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $10,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy from John. While Alice has made some concessions, the price is still above Bob's comfortable spending limit, and there's only one round left.  It's highly unlikely Alice will drop to his desired price point. John's offer provides a guaranteed deal within Bob's budget, ensuring he gets the product without exceeding his spending limit."
