That's a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my maximum budget is $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?,80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, I'm still a little over budget.  How about $90?  That's a significant price drop from your last offer, and it's the closest I can come to meeting you halfway.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. I'll try to find a middle ground, so I'll offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to stick to my budget here, Alice.  I can go up to $95, but that's my final offer.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us both closer to our desired outcome.",97.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go below $105. I'll meet you at $97.50, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we compromise at $102.50?",102.5,Alice,9,
