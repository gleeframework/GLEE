"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $14,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still at $13,000. This is the best I can do, as going any higher would put me over budget. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. ",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've already come down quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
