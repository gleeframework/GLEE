"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about buying but want a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. A counter-offer might bring the price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
