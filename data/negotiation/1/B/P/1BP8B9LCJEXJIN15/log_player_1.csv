Bob's offer is too low. I can still do better by continuing negotiations and seeing if he's willing to move closer to my preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Even though I'm running out of rounds, I'm not giving up on getting closer to my preferred price. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation isn't moving quickly enough. The price is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not confident that I'll reach a satisfactory price within the remaining rounds. To avoid the risk of ending up with a much lower offer than I'd like, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000. This ensures a guaranteed profit and allows me to move on."
