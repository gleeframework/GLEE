"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer to make this worthwhile. How about $1,650,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
