This offer starts the negotiation high, leaving room for potential compromise.  It also sets a clear expectation of value.  However, I am aware that John is willing to buy the product for $1,500,000, so I won't be willing to go lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to take $1,500,000 from John, so I need to counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to that price."

Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's, so it's a good deal for me. I'll accept it and sell the product to Bob."
