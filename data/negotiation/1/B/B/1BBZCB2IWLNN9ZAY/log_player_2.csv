"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $150. It's not worth it to accept her offer. You'll try to negotiate a lower price first."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm looking to get a bit more for it. How about $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Alice's offer of $130 is still above your limit. You'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to your target price."
