Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant returns you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to convince Bob of its worth. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  Even if he negotiates down, there's a good chance of securing a price significantly higher than $1,500,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** By not revealing John as a backup option, I maintain a stronger negotiating position with Bob."
