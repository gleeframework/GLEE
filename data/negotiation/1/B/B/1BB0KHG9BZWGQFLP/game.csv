"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was expecting a more serious offer considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
