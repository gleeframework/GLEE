Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds intriguing, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in making this deal work, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
