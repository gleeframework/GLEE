"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds intriguing, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in making this deal work, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $825,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $762,500.  This shows my commitment to finding a fair price, and it's closer to your bottom line.",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I like that you're willing to meet me halfway. However, $762,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My revised offer is $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider it.",800000.0,Alice,5,
