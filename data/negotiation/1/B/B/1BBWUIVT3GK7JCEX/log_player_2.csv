# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $950,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price.  Buying from John immediately would be a good option, but it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds intriguing, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in making this deal work, but I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $825,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can still get a better deal with John, but it's worth pushing for a lower price with Alice before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $762,500.  This shows my commitment to finding a fair price, and it's closer to your bottom line."", ""product_price"": 762500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I like that you're willing to meet me halfway. However, $762,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My revised offer is $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is your maximum budget, and it's the same price John is offering.  There's no benefit to continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point, as you're not likely to get a lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at your budget limit."
