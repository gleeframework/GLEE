I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price that's still above my minimum requirement and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer since it's still below his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,500. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum and closer to my initial offer. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer as it's only $500 above his offer and still significantly below his perceived value of the product."
