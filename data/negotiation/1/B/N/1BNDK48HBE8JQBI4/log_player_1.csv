"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a bold opening offer that allows for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I have a floor of $1,500,000 with John, so I have some room to maneuver.  I'm hoping Bob will counter, and we can arrive at a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's tempting to take the $1,700,000, I still believe I can get a better price. We've only had six rounds, and I'm still willing to negotiate."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's not ideal, it's the best option I have at this point. If I reject, I might end up with nothing or be forced to sell to John for a much lower price.  $1,725,000 is better than $1,500,000, so it's a reasonable compromise."
