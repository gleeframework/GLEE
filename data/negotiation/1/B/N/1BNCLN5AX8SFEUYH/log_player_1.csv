Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise considering both our desired price points. Let's find common ground and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to offer $1,275,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and  I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product while being mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,275,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
