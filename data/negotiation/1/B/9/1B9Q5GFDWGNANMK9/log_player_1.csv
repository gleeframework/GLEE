Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price of $1,000,000. I know it's a high starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low. I'm not willing to risk getting a worse offer from Bob in the next round. John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is more than I'm willing to risk losing by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
