Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing my bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?"") inviting Bob to counter-offer and begin a negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price from Bob.**
2. **Maintain the option of selling to John at my desired price if Bob's counteroffers are too low.**"
