"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I will reject Alice's initial offer of $120.  I can always buy from John for that price, so I have room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $100, which is $20 less than Alice's initial price and still within my budget.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and hopefully sets a good starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I believe there's room to get the price down even lower.  By rejecting this offer, I keep the pressure on Alice and show my commitment to getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $105. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while still trying to save money. It's a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price.  While $115 is not my ideal outcome, I've already been through several rounds of negotiation.  Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product for a lower price than John's offer, and it's within my budget.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and possibly reaching a stalemate outweighs the potential benefit of getting an even lower price."
