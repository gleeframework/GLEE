Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This leaves a good amount of profit for me while still being attractive enough for Bob, who values the product at $12,000. If he rejects, I'll have to consider if his counteroffer is worth it or if I should just sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm going to reject it and counteroffer. I can likely get closer to $10,000 with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a good compromise, meeting Bob halfway.  Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is a decent compromise. It's a significant improvement over John's offer, and further negotiation might not yield much more."
