"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but I understand its value to you might be around $100. Considering this, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing my budget. However, $95 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,
