"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but I understand its value to you might be around $100. Considering this, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can try to get a better price from Alice.  $95 is still a bit too high, but you can likely negotiate it down closer to your $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing my budget. However, $95 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a fair solution. I am willing to accept $92 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $92, which is a good price for you.  You can get the product for less than what John is selling it for, so it makes sense to accept her offer."
