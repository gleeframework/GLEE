Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still sticking to my initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is sticking to his price, we're still significantly above John's guaranteed offer. There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal than $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. I believe this is a very competitive offer, reflecting the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're moving in smaller increments now to signal that we're nearing our bottom line. This offer is a strong compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price well above John's offer."
