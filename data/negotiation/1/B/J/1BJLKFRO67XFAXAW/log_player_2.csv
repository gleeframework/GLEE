"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price.  Since there are 10 rounds, Bob has time to try and reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend less than that. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate. It's still within Bob's budget, but leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I believe this product holds significantly more value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and Alice is already willing to negotiate.  There's still room for improvement, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price.  With 7 rounds remaining, there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still sticking to my initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is standing firm on his initial counteroffer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting the product at this price. It also gives Bob some leverage in the negotiation. Since Bob has 6 rounds left, he can afford to be patient and see if Alice will budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. I believe this is a very competitive offer, reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $1,275,000, the deal is within Bob's budget and only a small increase from his last offer.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $225,000 compared to buying from John. With 5 rounds remaining, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price, but accepting now ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of reaching the end of the negotiation without a successful purchase."
