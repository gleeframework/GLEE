Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The high starting price helps gauge Bob's level of interest. If he's willing to negotiate down from $12,000, it suggests he values the product.
* **Fallback Option:**  Alice always has the option to sell to John for $8,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob immediately went to his maximum price, which is also our minimum acceptable price. This leaves no room for negotiation with Bob.  While accepting would secure the minimum, it's worth seeing if we can get a better deal through counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a fair deal considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $10,000, Alice shows willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his budget. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value this product offers"" reinforces to Bob that he's getting something worthwhile, even at a slightly higher price than he initially wanted to pay.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This counteroffer still allows Alice to make a $2,000 profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I still believe the product should be priced closer to my valuation. I am willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $9,000 provides a $1,000 profit, which is a reasonable gain.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk alienating Bob. He's moved closer to Alice's price, but it's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation rounds take time. Accepting the $9,000 now allows Alice to conclude the deal and potentially pursue other opportunities."
