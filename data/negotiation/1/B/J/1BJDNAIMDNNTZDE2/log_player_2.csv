Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what you could get from John. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.
