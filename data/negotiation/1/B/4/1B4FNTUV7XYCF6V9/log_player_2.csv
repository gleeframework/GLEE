"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum price. There's no benefit to accepting it immediately. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is just slightly above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. It's a good deal for Bob, so accepting it makes sense.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will reject, and Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price."
