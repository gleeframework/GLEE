I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, we can start the counteroffer process and see how much he's willing to pay.  I'll keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$70 is far too low for me.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $130.  This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."

I'm coming down to $110. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. If Bob is serious about buying, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, the negotiations are taking too long, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to sell to John for $120 to ensure a quick and acceptable sale."
