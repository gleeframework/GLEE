"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also looking to get a good return on my investment. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far apart from your price point. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table, but I'd prefer to work with you.  I could make a deal right now at $700,000."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for the update, Bob. I'm glad to hear you have another offer on the table, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll counter with an offer of $725,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to take the deal.  Alice is clearly holding firm, and while you could try to negotiate further, you risk her withdrawing the offer completely. Accepting at $725,000 gets you the product for less than John's offer and avoids a potential negotiation breakdown."
