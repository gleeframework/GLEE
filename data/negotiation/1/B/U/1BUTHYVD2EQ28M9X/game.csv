"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also looking to get a good return on my investment. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far apart from your price point. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with an offer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be frank, I have another offer on the table, but I'd prefer to work with you.  I could make a deal right now at $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for the update, Bob. I'm glad to hear you have another offer on the table, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll counter with an offer of $725,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
