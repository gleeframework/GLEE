"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make this work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a little too steep for me.  How about we try $700,000? That's a fair offer considering the value I see in it.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're getting closer to my price, but I still need to get a bit more. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $950,000 to make it worth my while. I'm confident you'll love the product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and my original price, so I'll offer it to you for $925,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
