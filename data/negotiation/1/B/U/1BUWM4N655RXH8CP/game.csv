"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm hoping to spend closer to $95. Would that work for you?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95.  To be honest, I'm really close to selling to someone else, but I'd like to see if we can close this.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
