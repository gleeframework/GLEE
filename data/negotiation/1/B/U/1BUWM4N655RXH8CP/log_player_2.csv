"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to be flexible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's try to get a better price from Alice first. $115 is too close to her value, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and keeps us well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. We can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm hoping to spend closer to $95. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to a potential agreement. We're still aiming for a price that benefits us, while acknowledging Alice's need for a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $95.  To be honest, I'm really close to selling to someone else, but I'd like to see if we can close this.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice has met our maximum price, and we've managed to save some money. There's no point in risking losing the deal by pushing further, especially since we can get the same price from John."
