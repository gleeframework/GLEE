"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you and we're confident it will meet your needs perfectly. Let's make this a win-win situation. Would you consider purchasing it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value you place on the product, how about we aim for a price of $90? This would still allow us both to benefit from the transaction.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How does $87 sound? It's a slight increase from your last offer, while still being more affordable for you. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",87.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $87 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $86?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",86.0,Bob,6,
