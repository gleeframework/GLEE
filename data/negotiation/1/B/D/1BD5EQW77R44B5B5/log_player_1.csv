Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Bottom Line:**  You're guaranteed $12,000 from John, making this your minimum acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob.  To entice him, you need to offer a price lower than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $10,000 (Bob's value) and $12,000 (your minimum).

**Offer Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High, But Reasonable:**  Don't start at $12,000 as it leaves no room for negotiation and might discourage Bob. 
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offer a price that allows Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal.

**Example Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $11,500. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $11,500 is a strong opening offer. It's below your guarantee from John but still gives you a significant profit.
* **Message:** The message is polite, professional, and hints at the offer being special without revealing your minimum price.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have room to go down slightly, but don't go below $12,000.
* **Alternative Buyers:** If Bob rejects your final offer, you can confidently sell to John for your guaranteed price."
