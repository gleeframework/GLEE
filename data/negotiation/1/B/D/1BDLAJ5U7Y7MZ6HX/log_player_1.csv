"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not excessively high. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a good chance of getting a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $180.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between our previous offers. This should encourage him to accept while still leaving some room for potential future negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial price, it's a significant improvement on his previous offer and only $10 less than my last counteroffer.  With limited rounds remaining, it's wiser to secure a sale than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's lower offer."
