"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.  Alice's offer of $95 is close, but you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $80, and I'm willing to pay up to $100.  Offering $85 is a fair compromise that gives Alice a profit and allows me to save some money. It also leaves room for potential negotiation if she rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still within my budget, and it's a better price than what John is offering.  It's also likely that further negotiation with Alice would result in a price closer to her valuation of $80, which wouldn't be worth the time and effort."
