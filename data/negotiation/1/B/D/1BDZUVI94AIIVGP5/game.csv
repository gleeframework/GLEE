"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $850,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
