"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything significantly lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $800,000 is too far off for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
