"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price that's lower than its true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little steep for me; would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can do $110, which is a significant discount from the original price, but still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I appreciate you working with me Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?,97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $97. I can do $105, which is a compromise that gets me closer to my target, but still gives you a great deal. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are getting close. I could do $100 to get this done today.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to sell at $100. I can do $108, which is still a great deal for you, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",108.0,Alice,7,
