{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob counter-offers, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm holding out for a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $115. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $112? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal from him.  It's better to secure a sale than to risk losing him and having to rely on John for $120."
