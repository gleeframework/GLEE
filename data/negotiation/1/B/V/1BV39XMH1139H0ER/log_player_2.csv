"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Here's why:

While $90 is less than your maximum budget and cheaper than John's offer, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  Alice might be willing to lower the price to avoid losing the sale."
