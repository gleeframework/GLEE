"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling comfortable with a price of $10,750. This seems fair, considering both our positions. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,750 is cutting it a little close. How about $10,900? That's my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",10900.0,Alice,5,
