Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Bob's higher value for the product,  making him more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can get closer to my target of $11,500 by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding firm on getting a better price than John's. I hope this will make him more willing to compromise."
