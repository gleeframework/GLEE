Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, his increments are small and it's unlikely he'll reach a price point I find acceptable in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
