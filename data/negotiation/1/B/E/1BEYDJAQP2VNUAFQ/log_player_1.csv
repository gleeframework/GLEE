Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for my minimum price, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $9,500 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets it for $1,500 less than his perceived value, and I make $1,500 more than selling it to John.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to adjust slightly while still staying above my minimum."
