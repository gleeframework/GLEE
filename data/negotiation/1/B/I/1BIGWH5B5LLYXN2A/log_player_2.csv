"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to both of us. Considering its value, I propose a price of $140 for this round. I believe it's a fair offer that allows us to both benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to get a lower price, even if it means going through more negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However,  I'm only willing to pay $130 at this time. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. To move forward, I would like to suggest a price of $135 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still below the original asking price, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $135 is close to my maximum price, and it's better than buying from John.  I'll accept the offer to secure the product."
