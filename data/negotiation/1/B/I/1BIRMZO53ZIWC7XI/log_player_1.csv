Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to immediately kill the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $12,000 offer gives me room to lower the price if necessary, while still ensuring a profit greater than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value for Bob, making the offer more appealing.

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, there's still room to find a price that's more acceptable to me.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob. 

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum value and see if we can reach an agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While $9,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This gives you a great deal, and it ensures I can cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000, which is a compromise between his offer of $9,000 and my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message highlights the benefit to Bob of getting a good deal and that the price allows me to cover my costs. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still keeping the price above my minimum value. 

By offering a compromise, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,000. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer of $10,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $15,000 minimum.  Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's willingness to meet halfway shows he's open to negotiation. I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, giving me the leverage to hold out for a more profitable deal with Bob.

I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,250 is closer, it's still below my minimum price point.  To make this work for both of us, how about we settle at $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,500. This is a compromise between his offer of $10,250 and my previous offer of $11,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm staying above my minimum value of $15,000 while also demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** The message highlights the compromise nature of my offer and suggests it's a fair outcome for both parties. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.  I believe this counteroffer is a good chance to secure a deal that is close to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any higher than that. This is my final offer

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitability:** Bob's final offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss. 
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating there's little room for further negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John is willing to buy the product for $15,000, guaranteeing me a profit and ensuring I don't have to settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum value.

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most rational decision, as it guarantees a profit and minimizes the risk of losing a potential sale."
