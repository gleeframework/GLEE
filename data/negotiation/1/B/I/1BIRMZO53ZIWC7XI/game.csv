"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While $9,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This gives you a great deal, and it ensures I can cover my costs. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,000. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,250 is closer, it's still below my minimum price point.  To make this work for both of us, how about we settle at $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any higher than that. This is my final offer",11000.0,Bob,6,
