"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is fair, given the product's worth to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and gets us closer to a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to reduce the price by $50,000. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that I believe will satisfy both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
