Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While the product is worth $150 to you, starting at that price is likely to deter Bob.  Offering it at $140 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation or a quick sale.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost out.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  The message leaves open the possibility for Bob to counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially sell for a price higher than $140."
