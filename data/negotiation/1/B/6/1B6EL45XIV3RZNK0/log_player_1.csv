Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $150 to Bob, meaning he would benefit from buying it at any price below that.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80, but aiming higher is always better.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with an offer of $130 leaves some space for potential haggling while still securing a significant profit for you.

By starting high but below Bob's maximum valuation, you increase the chances of him accepting the offer outright. Even if he tries to negotiate, you have a good buffer to work with and still reach a price that's better than your alternative deal with John."
