"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity for you to greatly increase your profits. I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you.  My asking price is $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. This gives me a better chance of getting closer to my ideal price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, reminding him of its potential worth.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm using a friendly tone and asking for his opinion, inviting him to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer is a good starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close as possible to $1,500,000 (Bob's perceived value) while still being open to a negotiation.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to keep my expenses within a certain limit. I would like to propose a price of $900000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's room for a counteroffer that will get us closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoid Selling to John Yet:**  I want to exhaust my options with Bob first. Selling to John would be a safe bet, but I'm aiming for a higher profit.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target. I'll adjust my counteroffer strategy based on how Bob responds to my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit below what I can accept at this time.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This gives you a substantial discount from my initial offer and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the value he'll gain by acquiring the product.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that my offer is fair for both of us. 
* **Direct Question:** I encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  My counteroffer signals that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not going to settle for an unreasonable price.  I'll analyze Bob's response to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $950,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I can't risk losing out on a potentially higher offer by accepting this.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob's offer is higher than his first, it's not yet a reasonable price. I believe we can still find a better compromise.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** Selling to John remains an option, but I'm not ready to do that yet. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'll aim to keep the negotiation going while maintaining my position. This will involve carefully analyzing Bob's responses and making strategic adjustments to my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  We're getting closer, but I still need to be able to make a fair profit on this product. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping it's a good middle ground for us.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm continuing to compromise by reducing my price again, but still staying above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility.
* **Emphasize Concession:** I explicitly highlight the concession I'm making to encourage Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Focus on Agreement:** I emphasize the importance of reaching an agreement, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

This is a pivotal round. I'm making a substantial concession, but still maintaining a profit margin that is acceptable to me. I believe this offer could be tempting enough for Bob to accept, but if he rejects it, I'll have to reconsider my options.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to make a more aggressive counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $975000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I can't sell for less and maintain my financial goals.
* **Negotiation is Stalling:** We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and Bob seems to be resistant to going higher.  
* **John is a Safe Option:**  I'm getting closer to my ""sell to John"" threshold. I'm not eager to do it, but it's becoming more appealing with each round.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make one final, slightly more aggressive counteroffer in the next round.  If Bob rejects that, I'll likely sell to John to avoid losing too much time and potentially a deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I want to make sure we both get a good deal.  I'm willing to drop my price to $990,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe this product is worth more to you than that.  I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.  If not, I'll have to seriously consider other offers.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my last major concession, bringing the price close to Bob's offer. It shows I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I have a limit.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  I emphasize the importance of making a decision and the possibility of selling to John if we can't agree.
* **Highlight Value:** I remind Bob of the product's potential worth to him to motivate him to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a high-risk, high-reward move. If Bob accepts, I'll secure a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John to avoid further negotiation and potential deadlock.  I'm hoping the urgency and finality of this offer will push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to propose a final price of $980000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $980,000 is only $20,000 below my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.
* **Negotiation Stalled:** We've been negotiating for several rounds, and Bob seems unwilling to go much higher.  I'm running out of time.
* **Risk of Deadlock:**  Rejecting this offer and counteroffering risks a deadlock. This could lead to losing both Bob and John as potential buyers.

**Strategy:**

Given the current situation, selling to John for $800,000 is the most sensible choice. I can secure a decent profit without risking losing both Bob and John. While it's not ideal, it's a better outcome than potentially ending up with no sale at all."
