Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to secure a good deal while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is still a bit below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,750, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12375. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds, so it's best to accept his offer and close the deal."
