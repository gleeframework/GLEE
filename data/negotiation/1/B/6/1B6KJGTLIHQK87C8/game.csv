"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $12500 is still a bit below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12750, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreeable solution.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12375. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12375.0,Bob,6,
