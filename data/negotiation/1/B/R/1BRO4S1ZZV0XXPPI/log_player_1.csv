Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your limits:** You have a safety net of selling to John for $80, so you won't accept anything less than that.
* **Bob's valuation:**  You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Finding a middle ground:** Offering the product at $100 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. This price point is attractive to Bob (saving him $20) and highly profitable for you (earning $20 more than selling to John)."
