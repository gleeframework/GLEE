# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for a special price of $120.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll get a lot of use out of it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $80 from John, which is significantly cheaper than Alice's $120 offer."
