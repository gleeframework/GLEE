Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:** This gives you some negotiating room. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit. 
* **It's reasonable:** A $15 profit is a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy with the initial offer.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's far below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You have room to negotiate, and selling to John for $120 is always on the table.  You'll counter Bob's offer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's above Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate but still want a good price.
* **It's below your initial offer:**  You're showing flexibility.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  $105 is still higher than Bob's value, but it's closer to his offer. 

This counteroffer is designed to keep the negotiation moving and hopefully lead to a deal that works for both of you."
