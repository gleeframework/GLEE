Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and get a better deal."

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. I'll counter again, moving closer to her price but still leaving room for further negotiation."
