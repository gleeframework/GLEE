"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $10000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you as it's above your minimum value.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000, which would still leave you with a decent profit considering your minimum value.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a solution that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9200. This is as low as I can go, considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",9200.0,Alice,5,
