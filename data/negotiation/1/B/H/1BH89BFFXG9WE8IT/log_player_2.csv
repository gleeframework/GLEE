# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $16,000. It's a valuable item that's worth at least that much to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment.  Let me know if you're interested, as I'm sure another buyer will be eager to snap it up if you decline.

You're better off buying from John for $15,000. Alice's offer is too high, even though she's trying to convince you it's a good deal."
