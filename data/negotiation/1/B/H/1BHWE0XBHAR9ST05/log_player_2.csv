"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than her initial valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a lower price of $1,000,000."
