{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm explicitly mentioning the product's value to him, reminding him of the potential gain he'll have by buying.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""What do you say?"" to signal openness to negotiation. This encourages Bob to counteroffer and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial deal. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I will need to adapt my strategy depending on Bob's responses and how much I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my starting point of $1,400,000 and only slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  Accepting this offer would mean a much smaller profit than I'm hoping for.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While Bob's offer shows he's interested, it also indicates he's willing to negotiate further. There's a good chance I can get him to raise his offer with a counteroffer. 
* **No Urgent Need:**  Since I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer right away.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise while still getting a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still represents a great value for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  I'm raising Bob's offer by $100,000, which is a significant enough jump to show him I'm willing to negotiate but not so large that it's unrealistic.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that the price is still a great deal.
* **Compromise Language:**  I'm using terms like ""compromise"" to encourage a sense of collaboration and make him feel like we're both working towards a solution.
* **Open to Agreement:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage him to respond and keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**  I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he continues to decline, I might be willing to lower my offer again, but only if necessary. I will continue to prioritize maximizing my profit while still keeping the possibility of a deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1300000. How about $1250000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though this deal isn't my ideal outcome, it still represents a significant profit.  It also demonstrates that Bob is a serious buyer, potentially opening the door for future deals with him.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks delaying the sale and potentially leading to a stalemate. 

**Next Steps:**  While I've accepted Bob's offer this time, I'll use this experience to inform future negotiations. I'll be more strategic in my initial offers, aiming for a higher starting point that allows for more flexibility without going too far above Bob's perceived value."
