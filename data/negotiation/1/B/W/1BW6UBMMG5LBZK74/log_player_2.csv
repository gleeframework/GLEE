Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I was thinking that since you're willing to pay $8,000, I could meet you at that price, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive. I'll give you a 1-year warranty on the product, which is a $2,000 value. So, I'll sell the product to you for $8,000, plus I'll include the warranty, which brings the total value to $10,000 for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is trying to sweeten the deal with a warranty, but ultimately the product price is at your target of $8,000. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate further, and waiting runs the risk of Alice withdrawing the offer.  This is a good deal, take it!"
