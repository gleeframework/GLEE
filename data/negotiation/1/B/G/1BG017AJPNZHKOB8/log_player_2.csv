"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $950,000. This leaves significant room for negotiation.
* **You have 10 rounds:** You have time to try and get a better deal.
* **John's price is a baseline:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,000,000 gives you a clear limit to what you're willing to pay.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice.  Consider offering something closer to $800,000 to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's not so low as to be insulting. It shows you're serious about buying the product, but you're also determined to get a good deal.
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Alice and your budget, making the counteroffer seem fair.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my need to earn a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high:**  While she's come down from her initial price, $900,000 is still significantly more than the product is worth to her. 
* **You're close to a good deal:**  You've moved the price down significantly in just two rounds. You're close to your target price.
* **More room for negotiation:** You still have 8 rounds left to try and get a better deal.

**Next Steps:** You'll want to send Alice another counteroffer, aiming to bring the price down even further.  A counteroffer of $875,000 or $880,000 would be a good starting point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both work together."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** This counteroffer is a small step up from your previous one, showing you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Emphasize fairness and compromise:**  The message highlights your willingness to be fair and find a middle ground.
* **Maintain optimism:** Expressing confidence in reaching an agreement helps keep the negotiation positive.

**Next Steps:** This counteroffer should put you closer to Alice's desired price point. You're now in a strong position to potentially close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887500. This offer reflects the value of the product to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:** While you're still paying more than the product's worth to Alice, $887,500 is very close to your desired price range.
* **You've made significant progress:** In just five rounds, you've lowered the price from $950,000 to $887,500.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will walk away or you'll run out of time and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

**Next Steps:** Accepting this offer gives you a good deal and ensures you acquire the product. You can always try to negotiate further in the future if you find a better price elsewhere."
