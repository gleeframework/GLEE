"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's something that I've valued at no less than $1,000,000, and I know it holds the same worth for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,050,000. This is a premium price, but I'm confident in the product's potential for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
