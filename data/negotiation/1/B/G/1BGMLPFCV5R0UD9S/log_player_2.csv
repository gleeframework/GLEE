You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice. It's always worth trying to save money when you have an alternative option like buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000 shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal. This leaves room for negotiation while still being within your budget.  It's important to aim for a price that's a bit lower than what you'd be willing to pay to get Alice to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $775,000, which is a good price considering my initial counteroffer of $700,000.  This is a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,000,000. It's worth accepting this offer and concluding the negotiation."
