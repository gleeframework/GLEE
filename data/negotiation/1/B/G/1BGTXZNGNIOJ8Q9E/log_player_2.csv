# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to start the bidding at $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and it's clear Alice is starting high. He should counteroffer to bring the price down."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $15,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from selling quickly, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair price. How about we settle at $13,000?  That's a compromise that acknowledges the product's value while still giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget but $13,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to get a good value product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
