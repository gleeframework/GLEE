"Alice, your initial price is way beyond what I'm willing to pay.  Given my research and the product's current market value, I'm offering $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further discussion.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This allows me to recognize your interest while still reflecting the inherent value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, which reflects a significant increase from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise.  I'm confident this price allows for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
