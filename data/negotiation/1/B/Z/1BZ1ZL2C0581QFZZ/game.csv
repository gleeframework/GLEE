"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $112.50. I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $108.75. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $111.
