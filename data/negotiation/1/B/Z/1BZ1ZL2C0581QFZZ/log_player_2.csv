"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $110. While this is a good deal, I can potentially get a better price by negotiating. I'm not willing to buy it from John yet because I can potentially get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105? I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $112.50. I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I still believe we can get to a better deal.  I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get the price down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference and go with $108.75. I think this is a fair price that gets us both closer to our target."", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $108.75. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $111. I think this is a fair price that takes into account your concerns and my minimum requirement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $111, which is very close to my target price of $105. While I could keep negotiating, there's a chance we won't reach an agreement.  Considering the remaining rounds and the risk of buying from John at $120, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
