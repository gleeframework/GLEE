Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on that price?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250

``` 

Bob's offer of $12,250 is a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price of $12,500.  I'm willing to accept it and close the deal."
