"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product. How about we split the difference and settle on that price?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12,250. Can you consider that?",12250.0,Bob,4,
