"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a bit above her valuation, it's still significantly less than your maximum price and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
