"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $120 is above your maximum budget of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice or choose to buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $100? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting lower:** This counteroffer starts lower than Alice's original offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable price:** $100 is still within your budget, and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still too low for me. How about $110?  I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable price:**  $110 is within your budget and a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** While you could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee you'll succeed.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time is a factor:** You have a limited number of rounds, and accepting this offer means you can secure the product and move on."
