Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely honest, my budget caps out at $12,000.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his maximum budget is $12,000. It's unlikely he'll go higher, and we know we have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John. It makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed profit rather than risk Bob walking away in future rounds."
