"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000) to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to sell immediately for that price.  I still have 8 rounds left and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is still above my minimum but shows some willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to counteroffer at a higher price."
