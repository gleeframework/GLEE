"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly above our minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We don't start at $1,500,000 (Bob's maximum) to give the impression we're open to finding a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Alternative Option:**  We are aware of John's offer ($1,000,000) as a backup plan if negotiations with Bob don't proceed favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This is a significant investment for me, and this price point reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,200,000 is a substantial profit, it's significantly below Bob's stated value and our target price. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  We still have time and negotiation rounds to try and bridge the gap. Rejecting this offer signals we're serious about achieving a higher price. 
* **John as Backup:** We haven't forgotten about John's $1,000,000 offer, which serves as a safety net if negotiations deteriorate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are lowering our price, but not drastically. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Justification:** We are reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Compromise Language:** By positioning this offer as a ""compromise,"" we encourage Bob to reciprocate with movement on his side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,300,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,300,000 represents a $300,000 profit, which is a significant return.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer to ""split the difference"" suggests he's trying to find a fair compromise. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have more rounds, there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal. Accepting now secures a good outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through entirely, leaving us with John's $1,000,000 offer."
