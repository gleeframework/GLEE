"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He's aiming to save as much as possible, and $1,400,000 is still $400,000 above his ideal price. Rejecting allows him to counteroffer and potentially drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This is a significant investment for me, and this price point reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's on the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,350,000 is still outside of Bob's ideal range. He's still hoping to get the price closer to $1,200,000. Rejecting allows him to counteroffer again and try to narrow the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,300,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
