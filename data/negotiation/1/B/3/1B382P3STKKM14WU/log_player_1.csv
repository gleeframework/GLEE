Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to offer $13,000. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and your need to sell the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is already getting close to my minimum, and while I could try to push for more, accepting $13,000 guarantees a profit without the risk of him walking away and having to settle for John's offer."
