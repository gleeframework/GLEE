"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $90, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $108? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",108.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $102, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we say $105?",105.0,Alice,7,
