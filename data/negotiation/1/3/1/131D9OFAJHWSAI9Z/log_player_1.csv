Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $14,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?
