Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high,  leave some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then potentially settle on a price still significantly higher than your alternative with John. 
* **Strong but Respectful Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, justifying the high price without being overly aggressive."
