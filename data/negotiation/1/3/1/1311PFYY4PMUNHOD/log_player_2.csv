"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is $100,000 less than John's price.
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,100,000, you're buying the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice as it allows you to acquire the product at a lower cost and still stay within your budget."
