Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding Bob's estimation, potentially piquing his interest and justifying the high price.
* **Alternative:** I'm aware I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000.  By offering it to Bob first at a higher price, I'm exploring if I can get a better deal before accepting the fallback option. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate the price."
