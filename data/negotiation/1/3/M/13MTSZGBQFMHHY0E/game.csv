"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $800000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'd be willing to pay $650000 for it,  given its unique nature. Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value lies above $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's rarity and uniqueness.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $725000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $700000, but I don't think I can go higher.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value lies above $700000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's rarity and uniqueness.",750000.0,Alice,5,
