"Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $16,500. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
