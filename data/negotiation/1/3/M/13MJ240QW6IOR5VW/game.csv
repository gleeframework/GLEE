"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've been carefully cultivating, and I know it has the potential to significantly benefit your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  This price represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's below its true market worth.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",12000.0,Alice,1,
