"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $9,500 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to be fair to myself too.  $9,000 is too low. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,250. Can we meet in the middle again?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some frustration, and I want to make this work. Let's try a different approach.  You're at $9,250, and I'm at $10,500.  To be done with this, I'm willing to accept $10,000. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
