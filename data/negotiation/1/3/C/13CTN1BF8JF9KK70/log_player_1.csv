I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe it's a reasonable starting point that could entice Bob to accept the offer while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I am not willing to accept such a significant loss in value.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is still a significant discount from my minimum value, but it's a fair compromise considering Bob's low offer.  I believe this price is reasonable enough to entice Bob to accept, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value.  I believe it's in my best interest to accept his offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer and potentially needing to sell to John for my minimum value."
