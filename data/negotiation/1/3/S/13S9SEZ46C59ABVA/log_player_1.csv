Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential.  I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) gives us room to negotiate downward while still securing a price well above our minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer acknowledges Bob's potential gain while leaving space for a counteroffer. This avoids immediately anchoring the negotiation at the highest possible price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message aims to build rapport and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more receptive to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is above our absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than our target price. We have room to negotiate further, and rejecting his offer signals that we're looking for a more favorable agreement. 

It's too early to sell to John at $800,000. We can likely secure a better deal with Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a competitive price.  While your offer is appreciated, the value of this product is considerable.  I could be flexible, but I'm looking closer to $925,000. This reflects its true worth and the potential benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession but Firm:** We've made a significant concession from $950,000 to $925,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, we're holding firm above $900,000 to maintain a strong position.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential gains and justifying a higher price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The language remains open, inviting further discussion and potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it would bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically moving towards a midpoint. While we'd prefer a price closer to $900,000, accepting his offer of $875,000 is the most logical choice at this stage:

* **Significant Profit:** $875,000 is still a substantial profit margin above our minimum of $800,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Further negotiation risks pushing Bob away. He might completely withdraw or become less willing to compromise.
* **Time Value:**  A deal in hand is better than the uncertainty of further negotiation. Accepting now secures the profit and avoids potential delays."
