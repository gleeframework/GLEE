"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening the negotiation with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value proposition:** I highlight the value of the product to entice Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in conversation and potentially reveal his own valuation. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play along in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,800,000. This price reflects the significant value of this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value reinforcement:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** I frame my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to emphasize my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to keep the conversation flowing and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1800000, which would be $1700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and is a reasonable compromise. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit.  Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal altogether, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000."
