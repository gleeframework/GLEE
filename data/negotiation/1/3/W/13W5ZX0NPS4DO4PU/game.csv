"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I'm confident this price still gives you a great value for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $94? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'd still be getting a great value for the product.",94.0,Alice,5,
