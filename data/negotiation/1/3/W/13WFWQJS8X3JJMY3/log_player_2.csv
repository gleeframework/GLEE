"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You're only willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so rejecting the offer allows you to try to get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is your maximum offer. You are hoping to buy the product for $1,000,000, which is your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000.  While this is still more than your ideal price, it's only $100,000 over your maximum.  You have two options:

* **Accept:** Get a decent price and get the product.
* **Reject and counteroffer:**  There's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer again, potentially forcing you to buy from John at $1,000,000. 

Since the difference is relatively small, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
