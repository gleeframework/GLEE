Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. At this point, the negotiations are getting tense, and I risk ending up with a higher price than John's offer. To avoid risking a further increase in the price, I'll take the safer option and buy from John."
