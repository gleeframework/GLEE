"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose an offer of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'm not desperate for a quick sale and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $16,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it gets us closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still looking to keep the price within my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $14,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is slightly below my desired minimum of $15,000. However, it is getting very close, and considering the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or even a deal breakdown, it's best to accept this offer. This ensures a sale and brings me closer to my target price. While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, there's always a risk that future negotiations with Bob might lead to a better deal."
