Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're glad you're willing to negotiate further, Bob. Considering our financial goals and the value of the product, we would like to counter with a price of $97 for the product. We believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $97. It's a reasonable price compared to our $120 alternative, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the price going up in later rounds."
