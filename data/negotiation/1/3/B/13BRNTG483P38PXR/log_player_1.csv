Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $149 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, which could lead to a slightly higher sale price.
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value for Bob without revealing your own minimum price."
