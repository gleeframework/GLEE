Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While not overly detailed, mentioning the ""significant value"" aims to pique Bob's interest and implies there might be benefits he hasn't considered, justifying the higher price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000. This knowledge gives you the confidence to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
