"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've outlined, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing.  I could consider letting it go for $1,000,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,000,000 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price point that reflects the product's true value to me. John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 is a better deal."
