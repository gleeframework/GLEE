"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've outlined, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its potential.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing.  I could consider letting it go for $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,000,000 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to look elsewhere for this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
