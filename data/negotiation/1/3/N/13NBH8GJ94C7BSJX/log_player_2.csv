# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $110.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $100, which is cheaper than Alice's offer of $110.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option."
