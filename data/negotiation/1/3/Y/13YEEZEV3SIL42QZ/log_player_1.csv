I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate and still achieve my minimum goal of $1,500,000.  I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to see if I can get more. Bob is likely aware of my minimum, and starting at that price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,800,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging his offer while still trying to get a price closer to my initial goal.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and I'm happy to secure a sale at that price.  While I could try to squeeze out a little more, the risk of further negotiation leading to a rejection and having to settle with John at $1,500,000 isn't worth it."
