"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price of $15,000, there's no reason to reject the offer and buy from John for the same price. You're essentially getting the same product for the same price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
