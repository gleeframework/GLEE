"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,800,000 reflects that more accurately.  Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I am too.  While $1,800,000 is still too high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
