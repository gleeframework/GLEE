Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can aim higher with Bob. Offering the product at $15,000 gives Bob a chance to accept a price that's still within a reasonable range of its value while netting me a significant profit.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** While $10,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a premium if he believes the product is scarce or offers unique benefits.
* **Negotiation room:**  The initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. I can then decide whether to lower the price, potentially closer to $10,000, to secure the sale."
