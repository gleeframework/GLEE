""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the product's worth to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I've considered your offer and I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable concession, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $2,000,000 is still out of my range.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,200,000. This is a significant move from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,200,000 is a substantial profit over Bob's initial offer and surpasses my minimum acceptable price. It's always possible to try for more, but there's a risk Bob could walk away. This offer represents a good balance between risk and reward."
