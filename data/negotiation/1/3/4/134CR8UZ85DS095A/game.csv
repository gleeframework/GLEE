"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the product's worth to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I've considered your offer and I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable concession, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $2,000,000 is still out of my range.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,200,000. This is a significant move from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
