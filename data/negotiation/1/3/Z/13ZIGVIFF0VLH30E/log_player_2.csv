"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're the only two parties interested in this product, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice has shown a willingness to lower the price, so there's a good chance you can get it even lower."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount.  I'm really interested in this product, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still $25,000 above your target price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to $700,000.  You've shown yourself willing to compromise, and Alice may be willing to come down a bit more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $715,000, which is just a small step away from your target price. I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while still being reasonable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000.

You're only $15,000 away from your target price.  It's likely you won't get a better offer from Alice, and it's better to accept now than risk losing the deal.  Plus, you're still saving $85,000 compared to buying from John."
