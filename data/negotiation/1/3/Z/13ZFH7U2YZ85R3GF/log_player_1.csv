{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a steal considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the potential value to Bob and frames the offer as a ""steal"" to pique his interest.
* **Open Ended:** The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and set a high starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's interest in the product suggests there's potential for a higher price.  
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a more acceptable price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still give you a good deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired price point.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a compromise by proposing a price midway between my previous offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($6,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights that this price still provides a ""good deal"" for Bob, encouraging him to consider it.

This counter-offer demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $7000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $7,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's a high risk that further negotiation with Bob will result in a price even lower than my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price.

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John at $10,000 than to risk a potential loss by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
