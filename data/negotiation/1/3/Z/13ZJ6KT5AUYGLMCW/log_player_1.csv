Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** While not overly detailed, mentioning the product's ""significant value"" subtly reinforces its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""I'm offering you the opportunity"" and ""What do you think?"" encourage dialogue and make Bob feel like he's part of the decision-making process.

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to be prepared to negotiate down from this initial offer. If Bob outright rejects it, you can gradually lower the price while still aiming to secure a profit above your $10,000 minimum. Remember, John provides a guaranteed $10,000 fallback, so don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet you at a reasonable price."
