Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $10,500 is too low, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only slightly lower than my target of $11,000.  Since I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob and I don't want to risk losing the sale, I'll accept his offer."
