Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know it's more than the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counter with a price closer to $100.  I think I can get closer to my target without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm coming down a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm confident that $95 is a fair price, considering my minimum and Bob's willingness to pay $90.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
