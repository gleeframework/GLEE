Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $150 to guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might pay a bit more than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $140 creates a sense of a deal for Bob (as it's above his $80 valuation) while still securing a significant profit for me if he accepts.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm still guaranteed my minimum acceptable price from John."
