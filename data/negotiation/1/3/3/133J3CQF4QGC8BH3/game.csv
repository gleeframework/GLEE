"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering the value it will bring to your business.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $8,500. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a good compromise for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a good compromise for both of us. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and it allows you to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good compromise for both of us, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've been thinking about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $9,200.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,950?  This is a fair price that's close to both of our desired numbers. Let me know what you think.",8950.0,Bob,6,
