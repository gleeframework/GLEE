Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. It's also a price that might be tempting for Bob, as it's not immediately unreasonable.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'd like to sell the product, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
