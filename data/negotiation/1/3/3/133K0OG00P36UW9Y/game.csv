,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $90 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $70?  That's a fair offer, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $85. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price!",85.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $87. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",87.0,Alice,7,
