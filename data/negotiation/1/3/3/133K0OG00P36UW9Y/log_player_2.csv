Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $87. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $85.  At this point, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal from John at $80 rather than risk Alice not coming down further within the remaining rounds."
