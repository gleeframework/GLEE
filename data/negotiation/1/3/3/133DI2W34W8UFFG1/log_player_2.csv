# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the impact it could have on your operations, I propose a special introductory price of $9,500 for you. This is an exceptional opportunity considering the product's true worth of $10,000 to you and my intention to maximize your savings. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than your maximum budget of $10,000 and also less than John's offer of $10,000. This is a good deal!"
