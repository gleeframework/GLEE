Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $115, which is a bit more than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:**  Starting high allows for the possibility of securing a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Having some wiggle room allows for a back-and-forth if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer.
* **Maintain Control:** By setting the initial price, I establish myself as the seller and have the advantage in the early stages of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $100. While it's tempting to accept his offer to avoid a longer negotiation, it's crucial to remember that I can still sell to John for $100.  By rejecting his offer, I maintain the opportunity to potentially get a better price from Bob or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $105 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial asking price.
* **Message:**  I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness by highlighting that it's still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining a Fair Price:** $105 is still above my minimum price of $100 and close to John's offer, so it's a good middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I'll have secured a good price for the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to save some money. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to stay within my budget of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum price of $100.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's important to consider the following:

* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further will take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $100.
* **Potential Loss:** If I continue negotiating with Bob and he rejects any further counteroffers, I risk losing both deals and ending up with nothing.

**Therefore, it's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed $100 for the product.** This minimizes risk and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
