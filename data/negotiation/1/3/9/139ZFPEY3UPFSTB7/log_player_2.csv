"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and still a good profit for me. I know you're interested, so let me know if you'd like to go ahead with this.  If you decide against it, I'll be selling it to John for a slightly higher price, but I wanted to give you first dibs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
