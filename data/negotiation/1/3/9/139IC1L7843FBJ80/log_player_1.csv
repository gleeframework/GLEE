"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. It's also important to leave room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still potential to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal considering:

* It's above my minimum acceptable price.
* We're already on round 4, so we're nearing the end of the negotiation.
* John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so this is a better deal.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a sale in the remaining rounds."
