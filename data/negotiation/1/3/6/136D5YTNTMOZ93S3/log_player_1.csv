"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me room to potentially come down in price, and it allows me to see how interested Bob truly is in the product.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we negotiate the price down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, and I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still staying within my desired profit range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is getting close to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $150.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering my minimum price, but framing it positively and emphasizing the value of the product. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the offer and close the deal."
