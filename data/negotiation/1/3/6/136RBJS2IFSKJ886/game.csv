"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?  That way we both get a fair deal.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $117.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $116.25?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",116.25,Bob,4,
