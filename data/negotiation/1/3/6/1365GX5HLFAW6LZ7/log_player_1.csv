Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 
 
This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept. 

Here's why:

* **For me:** This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and closer to the product's true value.
* **For Bob:** This price is still below the value he places on the product ($15,000), making it a good deal for him.

By offering $14,000, I increase my chances of a successful sale with Bob while still securing a profit."
