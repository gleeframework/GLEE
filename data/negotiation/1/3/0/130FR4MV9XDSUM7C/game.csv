"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay the full $800,000. I'm willing to pay $780,000, which is a compromise between my original offer of $750,000 and your latest offer of $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",780000.0,Bob,4,
