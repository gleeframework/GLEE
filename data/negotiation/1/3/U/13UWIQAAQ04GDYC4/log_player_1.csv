"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering its value and market trends.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am willing to pay up to $1400000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since I have 8 more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am now willing to offer $1550000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's only $50,000 less, which is a small enough difference that it's worth closing the deal now and avoiding further negotiation. There's always the risk that in future rounds, Bob will either lower his offer again, or I might not be able to get a higher counteroffer."
