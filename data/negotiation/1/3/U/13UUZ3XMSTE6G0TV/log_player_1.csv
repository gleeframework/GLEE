{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives you room to negotiate while still being within a reasonable range.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $11,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $13,000 to $11,500, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and it seems like Bob is firmly set on that price.  I'm going to accept his offer."
