Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,075,000 ensures a significant profit beyond my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
