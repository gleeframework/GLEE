"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $120.** You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* **You have a better alternative.** John is willing to sell the product for $120, which is still within your budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can purchase the product from John for a lower price."
