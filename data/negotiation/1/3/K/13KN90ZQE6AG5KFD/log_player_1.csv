"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize potential profit while still keeping the deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a decent amount, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired $14,000. This shows flexibility while maintaining a sense of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. There's still a significant gap between his offer and what I believe the product is worth.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's more profitable for me. I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer hasn't changed since the last round, so there's no reason to accept yet. I'll keep negotiating to see if I can get a higher price.  We're getting close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.  This is my final attempt to get a better price from Bob.  If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want it to be.  There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I meet my minimum requirement, and it's better than risking a lower price in the final rounds."
