Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500** is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* This leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my desired price without alienating Bob.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more likely for Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's so low.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $9,000? That's a good compromise, and it still gives you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns while still emphasizing the value of the product. I'm framing this as a ""good compromise"" to make it more appealing. 
* **Goal:** I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price of $10,000 as possible without risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm concerned that we're getting stuck in a cycle of increasingly small compromises.  I've already dropped my price considerably, and further negotiation risks losing the deal altogether. 

Selling to John at $10,000 ensures that I get my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of a lengthy negotiation that might not result in a satisfactory outcome."
