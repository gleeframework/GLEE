"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, it's worth $100 to you. Considering this, I am offering it to you for $95. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a product that matches your needs and expectations at a very reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is grossly overselling the value of the product to you. While her offer of $95 is less than John's $100, it's still above your $100 limit. By rejecting her offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer from Alice at a lower price."
