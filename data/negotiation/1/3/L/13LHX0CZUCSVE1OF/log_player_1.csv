Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  My final offer is $12,000. If you can't meet that, I'll have to go with another seller.

Bob is clearly unwilling to move beyond his budget of $12,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better offer. Since John is offering the same amount, it's time to move on and avoid wasting more time in this negotiation."
