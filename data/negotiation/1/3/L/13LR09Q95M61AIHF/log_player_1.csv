Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8,000 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum target of $8,000. I'll counter again, hoping we can reach a price closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $8,200 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. Let's try $8,400 as a final compromise.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Although I'm still below my ideal target price,  Bob's offer of $8,300 is very close and would be a decent profit. With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  It's time to accept the offer and move forward."
