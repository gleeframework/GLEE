"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? That's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $120.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $100? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
