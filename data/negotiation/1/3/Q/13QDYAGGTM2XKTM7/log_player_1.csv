Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $120 and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price slightly or accept his counteroffer if it's reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum price of $120, and it's likely that we'll be able to come to an agreement. I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
