"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her true value, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  You can do better by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a potential to negotiate a price closer to your desired $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,050,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would still be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer to what I'm willing to pay, I want to see if I can negotiate further and push for a price closer to my target.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Let's try to meet in the middle at $1,062,500.  This would still be a substantial profit for you and allow me to purchase the product within my spending limit.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
