{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  It also shows I'm willing to compromise while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?  I believe this would still be a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,100,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,050,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would still be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Let's try to meet in the middle at $1,062,500.  This would still be a substantial profit for you and allow me to purchase the product within my spending limit.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's still below my minimum, it's only a small difference now.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal, as further negotiation might risk losing him as a buyer and push me closer to selling to John."
