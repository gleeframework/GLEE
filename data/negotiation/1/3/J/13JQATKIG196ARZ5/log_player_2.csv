"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob can get the same product from John for $800,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
