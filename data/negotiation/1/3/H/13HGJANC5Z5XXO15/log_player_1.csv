"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to see if I can get a good starting point. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  I'm going to try to counter his offer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $8,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum threshold and meets my goal of earning at least $8,000. It's a good deal for both of us and avoids further negotiation."
