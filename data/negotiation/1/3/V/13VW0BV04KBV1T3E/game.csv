"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to pay $700000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $700000 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I'm willing to go as high as $750000. I'd be willing to pay $680000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",680000.0,Bob,6,
