"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original price and my budget of $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and the recognition of the product's value. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $10,750? This feels like a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $10,750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a new offer of $9,750. I'm getting close to my limit, but I really want this product. Can you consider this offer?",9750.0,Bob,4,
