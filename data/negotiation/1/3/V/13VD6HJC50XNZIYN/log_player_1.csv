Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and the recognition of the product's value. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are incrementally increasing and  it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
