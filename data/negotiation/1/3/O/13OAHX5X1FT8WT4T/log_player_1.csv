Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price seems a bit high.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential impact on your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $962,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. It's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is my final offer - it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* We're now at a price point that equals John's offer. It's important to signal to Bob that we have other options and this is our bottom line. 
* By framing it as our ""final offer"" and highlighting the value again, we increase the pressure on Bob to make a decision.  
* From here, we can assess Bob's response and decide if we should continue negotiating or go with John's offer."
