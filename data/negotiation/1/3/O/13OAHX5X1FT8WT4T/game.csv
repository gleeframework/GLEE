"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price seems a bit high.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential impact on your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is my final offer - it reflects the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
