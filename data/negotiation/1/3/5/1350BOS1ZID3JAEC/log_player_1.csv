Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why 1.5 million?** This is a significant markup from my minimum value (1 million) but not excessively high.  It leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested but also gives me a good profit.
* **Risk Analysis:**  While I could offer a higher price, there's a higher chance of Bob rejecting it.  This offer balances my need for a good price with the risk of Bob walking away.  
* **John's Role:**  Knowing John's offer of 1 million gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed at least 1 million.  

Let's see if Bob bites!"
