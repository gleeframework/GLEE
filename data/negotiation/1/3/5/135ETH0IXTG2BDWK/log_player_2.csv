"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $85 right away. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you can get the product for $100 from John, it's worth trying to get Alice down to $75. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still saving you some money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your goal, it's still not as good as John's offer.  There's still room to negotiate with Alice, and you're still within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer of $90 and your previous offer of $75. It's a reasonable compromise that still saves you money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your goal, it's still not as good as John's offer.  You're still within your budget and have 5 more rounds to negotiate with Alice.  There's still potential to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $95 to $90, and then to $95 again, showing that she might be willing to compromise. By offering $85, you are splitting the difference between your last offer of $80 and her most recent offer of $95. This shows willingness to negotiate while still staying within your budget. You are approaching John's offer, so this is likely your last chance to get a better deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is the same as John's offer. Since you have limited rounds and there's no guarantee that Alice will drop her price further, it's best to buy the product from John now and avoid the risk of further negotiation. You're not losing any money, and you get the product you want."
