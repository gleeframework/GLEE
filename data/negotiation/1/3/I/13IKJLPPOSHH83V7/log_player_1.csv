{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth $1 million to you. I'm willing to start at $900,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
