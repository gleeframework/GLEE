"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to meet somewhere in the middle of our ideal price ($80) and Alice's initial offer ($100).  It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $85 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, but we can likely get a better price. Let's push a little further down before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $90?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

We're getting closer to a price that works for us while still likely being acceptable to Alice."
