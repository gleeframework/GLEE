Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  It also gives a reason for Bob to consider the offer beyond just the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $85 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?"", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $90?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would like to get closer to my desired price, $90 is a fair compromise and a good deal for me.  Accepting this offer prevents further negotiation and ensures I receive a better price than selling to John."
