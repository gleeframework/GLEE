Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a fair offer.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but I have to be honest -  $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I've already made significant concessions to demonstrate my willingness to make a deal. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,500,000. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. If you're able to meet me at $1,600,000, I'm willing to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I need to consider my other option. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,500,000 (her product's worth to her), and she's even using another potential buyer as leverage. You've already reached your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's time to cut your losses and go with your safe option, John."
