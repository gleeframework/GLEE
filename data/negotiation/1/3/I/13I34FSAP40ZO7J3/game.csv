"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price that works for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
