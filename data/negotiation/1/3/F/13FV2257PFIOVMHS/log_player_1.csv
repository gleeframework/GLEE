{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique and valuable item, and I believe it would be a great asset to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price ($1,000,000) because I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good profit.  I'm also framing the message in a way that emphasizes the value and potential benefits for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, which is still a significant amount. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $750,000 is a good offer, it's a bit below what I need to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $850,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm emphasizing the discount from my original price and highlighting the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $850000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800000.  This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable value. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's better than selling to John for the same price. I'm happy to accept this offer."
