"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable figure.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,500,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to offer $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
