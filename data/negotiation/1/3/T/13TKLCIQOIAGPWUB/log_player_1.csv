Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're offering the product for less than what it's worth to Bob, making it potentially attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've left enough space for both of you to potentially compromise and find a price that works."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is above your minimum, and it's likely he won't budge much further. Accepting his offer secures you a good price, and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation or ending up with John's lower offer."
