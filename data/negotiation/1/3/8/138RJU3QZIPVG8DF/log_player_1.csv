"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150, which is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I have the opportunity to sell the product to John for the same price. Since there's no difference in profit, it's strategically better to sell to John now. This avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower final price."
