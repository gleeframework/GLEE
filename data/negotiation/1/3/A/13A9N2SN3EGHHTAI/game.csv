"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value it holds. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above my minimum threshold.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1050000.  This gives us both room to be happy with the deal.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value it holds. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950000 is still not meeting my minimum requirements.  I'm feeling more and more confident in the value of this product, and I believe it's worth more than that.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further to $1000000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
