"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price of $12,000. I'm counteroffering at $12,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm confident we can close the deal quickly.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a firm price, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point.",12500.0,Alice,7,
