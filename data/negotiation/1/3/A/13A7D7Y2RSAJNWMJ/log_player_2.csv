"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are 9 more rounds left, and Bob has a safety net in John who is willing to sell for $15,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but that's still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $11,750. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,750 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price point. He wants to save as much as possible and has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate.  There are 7 rounds remaining, so Bob can continue to try to get a lower price. Additionally, John's offer of $15,000 acts as a safety net, providing flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price of $12,000. I'm counteroffering at $12,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice has reduced her price, $12,250 is still higher than Bob's preferred price point. He has 5 rounds left to negotiate, and John is still a viable alternative.  Rejection allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm confident we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a firm price, and I'm hoping we can meet at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** There are only 3 rounds left, which is not enough time to meaningfully negotiate further. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has repeatedly rejected offers below $12,000, indicating she's unlikely to come down much further. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 provides a reliable alternative. Even though it's higher than Bob's ideal price, it's within his budget and guarantees a purchase.

By buying from John, Bob avoids potentially endless negotiations with Alice and secures the product within his budget."
