"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still finding it a little high. Could we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $115.  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting closer!  I could potentially do $112, but that's really pushing my budget.",112.0,Bob,6,
