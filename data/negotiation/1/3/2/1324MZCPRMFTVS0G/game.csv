"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's keep the negotiations going and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,800 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $8,200 for this product. This gives us both a fair deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $7,700?",7700.0,Bob,6,
