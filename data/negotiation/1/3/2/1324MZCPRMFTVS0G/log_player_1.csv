"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit.  I'm also making it clear that I believe the product is valuable, which may influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum price of $8,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that's less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's keep the negotiations going and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer.  I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to show Bob that I'm open to finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,800 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below it.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or John, so I'll reject this offer for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,800 is closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $8,200 for this product. This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
``` 

I'm again offering a price slightly below my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, aiming for a middle ground.  I'm also suggesting that this price gives us both a fair deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $7,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm starting to run out of time, and Bob's counteroffers are still below my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $8,500, it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to reach an agreement with Bob.  To guarantee myself a decent profit, I'm choosing to sell to John for $8,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe bet and ensures I don't risk losing money altogether."
