,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $90 is a bit too low for me, though. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy this product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer if you don't want to go lower.",95.0,Bob,4,
