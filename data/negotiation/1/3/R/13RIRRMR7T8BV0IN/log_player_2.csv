"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum price and even higher than her own valuation. It makes the most sense to go with John who is offering the product at your target price."
