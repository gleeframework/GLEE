"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $80 right now. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're open to that, I'm ready to make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
