"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a significant discount from its true worth, but I'm eager to make a deal with you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $6,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This still leaves some room for profit for me, and it's a price that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,3,
