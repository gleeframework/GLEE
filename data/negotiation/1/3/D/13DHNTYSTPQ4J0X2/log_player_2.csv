{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to signal your seriousness and that you're willing to walk away. This also gives Alice some room to come down, and we still have several rounds left to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my desired price. While it's getting closer, I can still try to get a better price. With 7 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer, but it's still above my ideal price. I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to pay her full asking price. With 6 rounds left, I have time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget of $1,500,000. This is the best price I'm willing to pay and also the same price John is offering. It's a good deal for me, and there's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product within my budget and without the risk of potentially losing the deal."
