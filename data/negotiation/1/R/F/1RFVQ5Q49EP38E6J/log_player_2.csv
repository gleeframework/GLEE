"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the price point you're proposing, but I'm hoping for a slightly better deal. Given the value it holds for me, I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than what he would pay John ($15,000). While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal, and it's likely that Alice won't go much lower.  It's better to secure a deal now and save the potential hassle of further negotiations."
