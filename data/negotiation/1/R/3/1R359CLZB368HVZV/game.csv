"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
