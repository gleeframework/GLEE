"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it's the best option. You can't get it cheaper from John, so accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
