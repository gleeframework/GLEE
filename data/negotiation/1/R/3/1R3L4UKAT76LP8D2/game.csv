"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $100, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $107.50. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",107.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high at $107.50.  How about $102.50? It's closer to my budget and would be a fair deal for both of us.",102.5,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $108. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but still a good deal for me. Let me know if you're interested.",108.0,Alice,5,
