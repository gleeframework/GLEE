"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. 
* I'm not going to immediately buy from John as there's potential to get a better deal with Alice. 
* I will reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for your product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget.
* I'm being polite and explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer. 
* I'm hoping this will start a negotiation that will lead to a price we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,500 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. 
* While I could try to negotiate further, it's risky to continue since there are only 7 rounds left and I could potentially lose the deal. 
* Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
