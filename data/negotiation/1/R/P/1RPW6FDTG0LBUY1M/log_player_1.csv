"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good deal. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm open to negotiation, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's slightly higher than his previous one. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not giving up on getting a better price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again to show I'm serious about finding a solution, but I'm not willing to go much lower. I think this price is fair considering our previous discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. There's a risk that Bob will continue to lowball me, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk losing more time and money."
