Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be realistic, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant difference from my initial asking price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find a solution.  Would you consider $1,825,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.
