"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be realistic, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to consider my offer.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant difference from my initial asking price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find a solution.  Would you consider $1,825,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the initial asking price, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, $1,825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $1,775,000? I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",1775000.0,Bob,6,
