Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer positively, highlighting the value to Bob while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** This starting point allows for a potential negotiation while still leaving me with a comfortable profit margin. 

By starting slightly higher than Bob's value, I can potentially squeeze out a better deal, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation, ensuring the deal doesn't fall apart completely. I'm also prepared to accept John's offer if Bob rejects my offer and the negotiation becomes too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reason:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would lead to a substantial loss for me. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will continue the negotiation and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Alternative:**  While John's offer is appealing, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, especially considering his initial interest. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to a fair price and my willingness to continue the negotiation. This can potentially lead to a deal that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we settle on $1,100,000?  This price still allows you to make a great return on your investment while ensuring I can cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $1,100,000, a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.  
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also stressing the opportunity for both of us to benefit from the deal.  
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is a compromise that keeps the negotiation moving. It shows flexibility while still maintaining a comfortable profit margin for me.  

By offering a compromise and highlighting the mutual benefit of the deal, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to reconsider and come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  John's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly more profitable and guarantees my desired outcome. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Factor:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks losing valuable time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirements.
* **Potential Downside:** Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price or a prolonged stalemate, which could ultimately result in a less favorable outcome.

**Conclusion:** 

Based on the current situation, selling to John is the most prudent decision. It ensures a profitable outcome and minimizes risk, allowing me to move forward with certainty."
