"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$8,000 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $20,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20000 is still too much for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

$12,000 is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'll try to negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 as a final offer. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can get to your price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not able to go above $10000.  It's a fair compromise considering your last offer and my budget. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.  Let me know what you decide. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
