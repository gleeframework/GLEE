"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be very valuable to you as well. I'm starting with an offer of $25000.  What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $20000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20000 is still too much for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $14000 as a final offer. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the closest I can get to your price. Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not able to go above $10000.  It's a fair compromise considering your last offer and my budget. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.  Let me know what you decide.",10000.0,Bob,6,
