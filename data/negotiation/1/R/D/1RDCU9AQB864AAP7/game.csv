"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great price for a product that's worth more to you than that. Let's make this happen!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $125.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $125 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $140. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's make a deal.",135.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50. This is a good deal for both of us, and I think we can close this right now.  What do you say?",137.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm very close to making a decision.  Let's split the difference and go with $136.  This way, we both get a fair deal.",136.0,Bob,8,
