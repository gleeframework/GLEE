"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
