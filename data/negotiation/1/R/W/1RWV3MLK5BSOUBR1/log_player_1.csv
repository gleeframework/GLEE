Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly higher gives Bob the feeling of potentially negotiating you down a bit, even if the $1,350,000 is your ideal price. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") can encourage a quicker decision in your favor.

This strategy balances getting the best price from Bob with the security of John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer if needed."
