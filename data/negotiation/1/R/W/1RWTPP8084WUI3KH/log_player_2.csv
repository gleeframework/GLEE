Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this price, as I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Alice has met your target price! There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John for the same price.  This is the best possible outcome for you."
