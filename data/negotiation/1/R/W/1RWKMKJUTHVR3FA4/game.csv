"Hi Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for your product, but I need to stay within that price range to make this purchase worthwhile. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1750000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for your product.  I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1600000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1650000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and potential. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1650000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1625000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1625000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I need a little more to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1630000. This is a small compromise that allows us both to achieve a successful outcome.  Let's reach an agreement before I have to consider other options.",1630000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your need for a good deal, but $1630000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1625000. If we can't agree, I'll need to explore other options. What do you say?",1625000.0,Bob,8,
