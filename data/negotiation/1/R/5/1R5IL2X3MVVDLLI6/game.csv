"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,500,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
