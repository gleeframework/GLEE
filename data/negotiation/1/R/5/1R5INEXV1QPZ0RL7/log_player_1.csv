{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, we can go from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm counter-offering at $12,000. This is my minimum value for the product, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's last offer, and I hope it will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm not sure if he's willing to go higher. It's getting late, and I don't want to risk losing John, who's guaranteed to pay my minimum value.  I'm going to sell to John."
