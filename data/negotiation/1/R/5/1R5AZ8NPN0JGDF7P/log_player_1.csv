{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the value proposition of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum of $150 to allow for potential counteroffers and a smoother negotiation."
