"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy with the deal. Let's close this now.",875000.0,Bob,4,
