"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is your maximum price. There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $9000? It's a compromise that works for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still closer to my maximum than I'd like. I want to see if I can get Alice down even further.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping for. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $8500. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? It's a fair price that takes into account the value I know the product has, but also shows I'm willing to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her original asking price.  $9,250 is a fair compromise, and I'm likely to save more money by accepting than by trying to negotiate further.  It's also worth noting that John's price is only $750 higher, and the risk of further negotiation falling apart means accepting is the safer bet."
