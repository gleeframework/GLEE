"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $9000? It's a compromise that works for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $9000 is still a bit more than I was hoping for. How about $8500? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to purchase the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $8500. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? It's a fair price that takes into account the value I know the product has, but also shows I'm willing to work with you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
