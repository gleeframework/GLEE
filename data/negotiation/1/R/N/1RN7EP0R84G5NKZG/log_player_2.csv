"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, you can likely do better by counteroffering. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $140. This price is still above Alice's value of $120, making it a potential win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than my initial offer of $130, and it's closer to my upper limit of $150. However, it's still not a great deal. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for improvement, and I don't want to rush into a purchase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $135. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is at my upper limit of $150. It's no longer advantageous to continue negotiating, as John is also offering the product for $150.  There's no benefit in continuing the negotiation with Alice, as I'm unlikely to get a better deal. It's more efficient to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
