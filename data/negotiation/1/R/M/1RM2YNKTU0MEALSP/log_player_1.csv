Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
$6,000 is too low for me. I'd rather try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8000}
