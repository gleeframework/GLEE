Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",

``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly below my maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more time to get a better price."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $98? That's a fair deal for both of us."",

This counter-offer splits the difference between her current offer and my previous one. It shows I'm willing to compromise but also sets a firm price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer it to you for $110, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice seems firm at $110 and is unlikely to budge further. While I could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price when I have a guaranteed option at $120 from John."
