,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. While $900,000 is certainly appealing, the value this product brings to the table is substantial. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,025,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's inherent worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
