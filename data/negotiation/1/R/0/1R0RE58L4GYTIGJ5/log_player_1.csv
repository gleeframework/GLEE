"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I get significantly more than my minimum desired price of $800,000. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my profit while leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000 to Bob. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I earn more than my minimum desired price.  I believe this is a fair offer that will likely be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $900,000. This is a good compromise, as it is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and still leaves some room for profit. While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
