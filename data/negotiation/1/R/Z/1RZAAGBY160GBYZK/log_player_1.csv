Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to encourage Bob to accept the higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, which might be important to him even if he's willing to pay the full asking price.
* **Time Pressure:**  The mention of ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
