"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I've carefully considered the product's value and potential, and I'm confident it's worth more than your proposed price. To move us closer, I'm willing to let it go for $2,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. I believe this is a more balanced price that reflects the product's value and potential.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe $1,700,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  My final offer is $1,950,000.  This is a fair price considering its true worth.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,950,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,800,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
