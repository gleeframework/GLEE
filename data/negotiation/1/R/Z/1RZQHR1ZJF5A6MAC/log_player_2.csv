"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down. You're willing to pay $120 to John, so there's some wiggle room for negotiation."
