"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a great starting point. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value the product brings to the table, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value and the effort we've put into this negotiation, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $780,000?  This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a new price of $800,000. This is the last concession I'm willing to make. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to reconsider the sale. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
