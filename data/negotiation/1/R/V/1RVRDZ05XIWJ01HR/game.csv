"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me to consider. How about we settle at $13,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
