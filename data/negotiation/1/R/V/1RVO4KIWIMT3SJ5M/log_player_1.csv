Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price, and it gives you a significant advantage. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a significant discount for Bob but still leaves me with a good profit.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm framing the offer as a way for Bob to gain an advantage, which is more appealing than just a simple price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at a lower price than my floor, I give myself space to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Setting a deadline:** I'm implicitly setting a deadline by mentioning John, which creates urgency for Bob to act."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's offer shows interest, I believe there's room for negotiation and a higher price.
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price, aiming to secure a better deal while still keeping John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,100,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to consider your offer seriously. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my starting price. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Reiterate the value:** I emphasize that this price is ""fair for both of us,"" highlighting the mutual benefit of the deal.
* **Keep the pressure on:** I reiterate the importance of a timely decision by asking for Bob's thoughts. This reminds him that I have other options.
* **Staying above the minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant portion of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, suggesting there's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John provides leverage:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at a much higher price gives me strong leverage. I can afford to be patient and push for a better offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter again with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to secure a better deal without risking a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $1,150,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal on this offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm positioning this as my final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This demonstrates a continued willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need to reach a deal now, subtly reminding Bob of the opportunity cost of delaying. 

By offering a slightly higher price, I'm aiming to bridge the gap with Bob while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This increases the likelihood of a deal while still protecting my financial interests."
