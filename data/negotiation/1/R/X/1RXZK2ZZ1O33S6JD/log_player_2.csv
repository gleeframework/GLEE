"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob. While Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000, Alice's offer is already at $1,450,000. It's beneficial for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above Bob's preferred range.  Bob has some room to negotiate further and can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $1,375,000 is still a bit high. Let's split the difference and go with $1,337,500.  This feels like a fair price point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1337500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I'm willing to move a bit further, how about $1,356,000?  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it makes sense on my end too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,356,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,356,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,356,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,337,500.  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and he's already getting a good price. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a price within his budget and avoid the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John at a higher price."
