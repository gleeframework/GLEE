"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $10,000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. Considering our previous offers, I'll make a new counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unlikely to budge from the $11,000+ range. It's not worth risking a worse deal or running out of rounds. Buying from John guarantees the best price for my budget."
