"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000 for the product?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $12,000 as it's below my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm going to stick with my offer of $12,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller.",12000.0,Bob,6,
