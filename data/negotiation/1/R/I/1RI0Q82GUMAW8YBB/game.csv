"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay  $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
