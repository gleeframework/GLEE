"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm initially offering it for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to part with it for $15,500.  This offer stands, but I am also open to hearing your thoughts.",15500.0,Alice,5,
