Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a higher price for you.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  Starting at a lower price than Bob's perceived value makes you seem reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is more than your minimum, it's still far below the value Bob places on the product. There's room for negotiation, and you're likely to get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to cover your costs, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $9,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,750 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000 and gets you closer to your desired price.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or you could end up getting a lower price.  Accepting his offer ensures a good deal for both parties."
