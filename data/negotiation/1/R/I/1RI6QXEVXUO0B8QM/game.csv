"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a steal for a product this good!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  However, $160 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $110?  That's a fair offer, considering its actual value.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $110 is still too low.  How about $140? That's my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're firm on your price, but I can't justify going above $120.  That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you say?",120.0,Bob,6,
