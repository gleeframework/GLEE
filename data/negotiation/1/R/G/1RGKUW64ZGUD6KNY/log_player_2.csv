"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There is room for both parties to find a price that is more beneficial.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  By offering $9,500, he's making a significant counteroffer that is still within his budget, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice a substantial incentive to negotiate further, potentially reaching a price that is favorable for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is cheaper than buying from John, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He is willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice's offer is still above her minimum acceptable price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a price closer to his ideal target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has a clear budget in mind. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable compromise that is still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob wants to save as much money as possible, Alice's latest offer of $13,500 is getting closer to his maximum price of $15,000. Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice walking away or reaching a stalemate.  It's more strategic for Bob to accept this offer, saving $1,500 compared to buying from John, and minimizing the risk of losing out on the product."
