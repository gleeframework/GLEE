Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Back-up:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. You won't go below that price.

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. You could choose to:

* **Start higher:** Aim closer to $1,400,000, but this increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright.
* **Provide more context:** Explain some of the product's value to Bob in your message to justify the high price."
