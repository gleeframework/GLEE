Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he wants the product badly enough.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's $8,000, making it clear I'm aiming for a good deal. 

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of acceptance."
