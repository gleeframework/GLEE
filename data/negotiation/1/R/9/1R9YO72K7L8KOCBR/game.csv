"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider it?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $10,000 is really the lowest I can go.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
