"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than John's offer, Bob has 10 rounds and can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me and the potential for negotiation, I'd like to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This price takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the product's true worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's desired price point.  While there's still room for negotiation, it's likely that further rounds will lead to smaller price reductions. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay more to John."
