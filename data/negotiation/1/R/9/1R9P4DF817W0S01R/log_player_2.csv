"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1400000. It's a valuable asset that I believe would be a great addition to your portfolio. This price represents a significant value to you, considering its worth to you is $1500000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up at $1000000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Even though you could get it from John for $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000."
