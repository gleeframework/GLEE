"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth more to me, and I think it's a good value for you too. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's better to negotiate a lower price or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a lower counteroffer than your ideal price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is crucial to keep the negotiation moving smoothly, even if you're aiming for a significantly lower price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $6,000, we're signaling that we're willing to negotiate, but we're also a good distance away from Alice's starting point. This might encourage her to come down on her price significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, it's still above John's offer. We've made progress in the negotiation, and it's worth seeing if we can get closer to John's price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate the effort. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  We're moving closer to a potential agreement. By offering $7,000, we're essentially splitting the difference between her previous offer ($8,500) and our previous counteroffer ($6,000). 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still below John's offer, keeping the pressure on Alice to make a competitive offer while signaling our willingness to compromise.
* **Clear and Concise:** We're keeping the communication straightforward and positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $7,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Alice's offer is still above John's price. With enough rounds left, it's strategically sound to see if we can push for a slightly better deal before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. How about we settle at $7,200?  That's a significant move on my part, and it shows I'm serious about buying."",
""product_price"": 7200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're offering a smaller concession this round ($300 vs. $500 previously) to signal that we're reaching our limit but still willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** Emphasize that we've made a substantial move to show Alice we are committed to reaching an agreement. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation window. This counteroffer puts a bit more pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to make a deal with us or risk losing the sale."
