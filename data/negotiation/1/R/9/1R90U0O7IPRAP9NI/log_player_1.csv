This is a tough choice, but considering the following:

* **Time is running out:** This is the last round. 
* **Bob is close to your minimum:** While not ideal, $882,500 is only $2,500 less than your previous offer. 
* **John is a backup:** You have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, which makes taking a slight risk with Bob more acceptable.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale and avoid risking losing out entirely to John."
