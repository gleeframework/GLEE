"Alice, $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for your product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let's make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,550,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
