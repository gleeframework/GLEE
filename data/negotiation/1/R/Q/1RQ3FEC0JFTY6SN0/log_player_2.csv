"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $10,000 is a good price, but there are still 9 rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so a counteroffer of $7,000 is a bold move. This is a 30% reduction from Alice's initial price, which is a substantial drop. It's a gamble, but if successful, Bob will save a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay right now. There are still many rounds left, and Bob believes he can negotiate a lower price. He's willing to continue negotiating to reach a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. $8,000 is a compromise, and it shows that Bob is serious about buying the product while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while testing Alice's willingness to meet Bob halfway."
