Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $130. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $130 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($50) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($20). This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Backup Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100, which acts as your safety net. 

By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, you increase your chances of securing a higher profit than selling to John."
