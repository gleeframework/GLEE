Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price even closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""value and potential."" This subtle approach might encourage Bob to accept the higher price without feeling like he's overpaying significantly. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the offer, you still sell the product at your minimum acceptable price."
