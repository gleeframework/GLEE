Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value that could greatly benefit you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so any price significantly higher than this is likely to be rejected.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,200,000. This means Alice shouldn't sell for less than this amount.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still staying above John's offer. This gives Alice the best chance to maximize her profit. 

**The goal is to find a price that is appealing to Bob while still maximizing profit for Alice.**"
