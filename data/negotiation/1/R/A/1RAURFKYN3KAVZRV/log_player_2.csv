Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm really committed to getting a fair price for this product, and I think it's worth more than that. To be honest, I'm also running out of time - I have another buyer who's willing to pay $15,000.  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon. If you're serious about purchasing it, how about we settle on $12,500? That's a good price for both of us.
