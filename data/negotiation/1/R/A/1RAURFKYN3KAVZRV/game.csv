"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm really committed to getting a fair price for this product, and I think it's worth more than that. To be honest, I'm also running out of time - I have another buyer who's willing to pay $15,000.  I'm hoping we can close this deal soon. If you're serious about purchasing it, how about we settle on $12,500? That's a good price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I've already come up in my previous offers. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,6,
