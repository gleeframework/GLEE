"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  That's a significant amount of money, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can see you're making a genuine effort to reach a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a price that's close to its true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $990,000. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Alice,7,
