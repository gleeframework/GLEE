Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This reflects the product's value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you value the product highly, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Selling to John ensures I get the minimum acceptable price for the product."
