"Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This reflects the product's value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you value the product highly, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
