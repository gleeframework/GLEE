As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is still below the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a revised price of $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice seems pretty firm on that $900,000 price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower.  It's not worth the risk of her digging in and you ending up having to pay more than John's price anyway."
