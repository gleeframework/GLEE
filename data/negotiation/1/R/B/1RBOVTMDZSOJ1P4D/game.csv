"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a good price. However, I am looking to keep my budget under $15000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $13000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm happy to continue the negotiation. However, $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $13500, which is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
