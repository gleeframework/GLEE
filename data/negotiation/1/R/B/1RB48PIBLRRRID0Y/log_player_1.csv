"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident that this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit margin of $200,000.  This is a strong opening offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will counter-offer, and we can go from there.  However, if he rejects my initial offer, I will have to seriously consider selling to John for $1,000,000 to avoid losing out on a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. It's my maximum, but I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not going to accept it at this stage. I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my target, leaving room for negotiation but ensuring a reasonable profit for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints.  While $800,000 is not feasible for me, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This would give us both a win-win scenario. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I've lowered my price to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but it also ensures I don't lose out on the value of the product.  I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Bob, and we can finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, which would be a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to settle for that. I'm confident that I can get a better deal.  I'll counter-offer with a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us.  However, if he rejects my counteroffer again, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as the risk of losing out on a guaranteed profit is starting to outweigh the potential of a slightly better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we split the difference and agree on $950,000? It's a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but I'm still significantly below my initial asking price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also protects my profit margin.  It's a strong compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously reconsider selling to John, as the risk of losing out on a guaranteed profit is becoming too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a good price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $925,000?  It's a significant compromise for me, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still not willing to settle for a price below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I've come down from my initial offer considerably, and Bob has also shown a willingness to compromise. However, the risk of selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming a real concern. I'll counter-offer with a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but if he rejects it again, I will likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. While $925,000 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. It's my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but still significantly below my initial asking price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also protects my profit margin. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept it. However, if he doesn't, I'll likely sell to John, as the risk of losing out on a guaranteed profit is becoming too high."
