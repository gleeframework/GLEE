{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's in my best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. It's my maximum, but I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints.  While $800,000 is not feasible for me, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This would give us both a win-win scenario. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can get closer to my target. There are still many rounds left, and I want to ensure I get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, which would be a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we split the difference and agree on $950,000? It's a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my target of $800,000. I want to see if we can push for a lower price, especially as we are now halfway through the negotiation rounds. I have some room to negotiate without risking the deal falling through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a good price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $925,000?  It's a significant compromise for me, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. While $925,000 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. It's my final offer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still above my budget.  With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely I can push for a lower price.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and secure the product."
