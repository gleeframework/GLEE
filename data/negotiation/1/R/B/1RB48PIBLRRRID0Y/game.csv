"Alice, your offer is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. It's my maximum, but I'm hoping we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints.  While $800,000 is not feasible for me, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This would give us both a win-win scenario. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $900,000, which would be a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we split the difference and agree on $950,000? It's a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $925,000?  It's a significant compromise for me, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. While $925,000 is a good offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. It's my final offer. Let me know your decision.",975000.0,Alice,7,
