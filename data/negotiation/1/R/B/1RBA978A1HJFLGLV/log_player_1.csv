Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to start with a price of $900,000. This leaves some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get more than the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, he might be willing to pay a little extra to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I believe I can get a higher price. I'm going to counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $875,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has not budged from his last offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, I'm running the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.  At this point, accepting his offer of $850,000 ensures a sale and a decent profit."
