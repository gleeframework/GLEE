Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price of $120 but allows for negotiation.  It also leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's worthwhile to see if we can find a middle ground.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $90?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $120 from John.  There's no guarantee that Bob will continue to raise his offer and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal."
