Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $130 is less than Bob's perceived value of $150, making it attractive to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for both of you to compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still room for you to get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $125?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go above $120 for the product. I understand we're close, but I hope you can accommodate this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's best to accept Bob's offer.  While you'd ideally like to get closer to your initial asking price, there's a risk of going back and forth and ultimately losing the sale to John.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees you a profit of $20, which is a good outcome considering your minimum acceptable price."
