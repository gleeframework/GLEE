"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers substantial returns and I wouldn't want to undervalue it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I still believe there's room for negotiation. My revised offer is $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. However,  $950,000 remains beneath what I consider a fair deal. Let's settle this at $1,100,000 and finalize our agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Respectfully, Alice, I think $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I would like to propose a final offer of $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
