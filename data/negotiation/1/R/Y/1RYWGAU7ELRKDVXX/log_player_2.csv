"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $15,000 is not a good option. Buying from John for $12,000 is the best option if Bob cannot negotiate a better price with Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $14,000.  He is willing to pay up to $12,000, and can always buy from John. There's still room to negotiate further with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down a little more to close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, he can make a counteroffer closer to his limit and potentially secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

At this point, Alice has shown she's not willing to come down to Bob's preferred price. Accepting her offer at $13,000 would be a loss for Bob.  It's better to buy from John for $12,000 and save the extra $1,000."
