Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price with the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly suggesting it might be worth even more than Bob realizes. 
* **Open to Discussion:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm inviting him to counter and engage in the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving open the possibility of a deal with Bob. I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I'll be carefully considering Bob's responses and my alternative option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's first counteroffer suggests he's aiming for a much lower price point. 

I'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but reflects some movement towards Bob's range. This strategy keeps the negotiation alive while demonstrating I'm serious about finding a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $800,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we consider $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:** I'm holding my position at my absolute minimum price of $1,200,000. This sends a clear message that I'm serious about the value I place on the product.
* **Compromise:** To show flexibility, I'm offering to meet exactly halfway between my initial offer ($1,600,000) and his initial counteroffer ($800,000). This substantial concession might encourage him to negotiate more seriously.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential benefits specifically for Bob, hoping to reframe his thinking beyond just the price tag.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between firmness and flexibility. I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate but also making it clear that I have a bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,200,000 is still above what I can justify. How about we settle at $950,000? This offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,200,000. While he is moving closer to my price range, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum.  

Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Setting a precedent:** Further concessions might encourage him to lowball even more.
* **Losing time:**  Prolonged negotiation delays me from securing a guaranteed sale with John.

Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most rational decision at this point. It guarantees I receive my minimum acceptable price without further risk or delay."
