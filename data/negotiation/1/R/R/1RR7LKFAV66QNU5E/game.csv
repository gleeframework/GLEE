"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $800,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,200,000 is still above what I can justify. How about we settle at $950,000? This offer represents a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
