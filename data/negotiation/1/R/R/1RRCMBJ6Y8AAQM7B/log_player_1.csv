Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $100 to him.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $105? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
