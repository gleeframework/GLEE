Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and make Bob feel valued. 
* **Value proposition:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Option to walk away:** While I'm offering a price I'm happy with, I can still choose to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't meet my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this would mean a large financial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, it's not enough for me yet. I can still counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer as backup:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 provides me with a safety net, so I can be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This gives you a good deal while ensuring I can get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I emphasize that my counter-offer gives Bob a good deal, making it more appealing.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $10,750 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not losing out financially.
* **Open for further discussion:** I don't completely close the door, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer again if he's not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we go with $9,750? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, but I'm still interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,750 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has already stated his highest price, so further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John's offer is more favorable:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would prolong the process and potentially result in a lower price. It's more efficient to take John's offer and move on."
