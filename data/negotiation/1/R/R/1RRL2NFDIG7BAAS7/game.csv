"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for my budget though.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit steep for you, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $120. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we try to find a middle ground closer to my initial offer? Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. I can see that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $75, which is $97.50. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate with me.  While $97.50 is closer, I'm working with a tight budget. Could you do $80? That's the very most I can afford.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is the absolute maximum you can afford, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $110. I've already met you halfway a few times, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $90. That's the lowest price I can accept.",90.0,Alice,7,
