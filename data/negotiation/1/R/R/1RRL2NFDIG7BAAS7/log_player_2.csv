Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is the absolute maximum you can afford, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $110. I've already met you halfway a few times, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $90. That's the lowest price I can accept.
