"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth far more than its tangible value. This unique offering is not just a product; it's an investment in excellence and potential. Given its significance and the benefits it promises, I am extending this chance to purchase the item for $1,250,000.

This price reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic worth to me and its perceived value to you. It allows for a fair transaction while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I understand that such a significant investment requires careful consideration, and I am confident that this product will exceed your expectations and contribute significantly to your endeavors.

Should you decide to proceed, please let me know, and we can arrange the details accordingly. If you need any further information or have questions about the product, feel free to ask. I am here to support you throughout this process.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for further negotiation or can proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
