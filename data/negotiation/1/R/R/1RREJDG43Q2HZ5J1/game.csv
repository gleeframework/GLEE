"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this our final offer. I'm prepared to agree to $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, as it's the lowest I'm willing to go to ensure a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
