"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming to buy the product for $800,000 or less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and hopefully negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still higher than your target of $800,000. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this our final offer. I'm prepared to agree to $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, as it's the lowest I'm willing to go to ensure a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still above your target price.  You have already gone through several rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely she will go lower.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John for $800,000 and save yourself the further risk of continued negotiation."
