"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming closer to my budget, Alice. While $14,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my strong interest in the product.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,000. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value of $12,000. I'll offer you the product for $12,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",12800.0,Alice,7,
