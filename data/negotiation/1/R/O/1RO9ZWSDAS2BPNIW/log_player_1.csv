"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price. 
* **Strategic Reserve:**  I have John as a backup, so I can afford to be firm if Bob isn't willing to meet my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's rejection shows he's willing to negotiate, his offer is still too low.
* **Opportunity to improve the deal:**  I have 8 rounds left, and by rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I will also try to understand Bob's reasoning for his initial low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $11,000 is below my initial price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $18,000 to $14,000.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Collaborative Approach:**  I'm using language like ""work together"" to create a sense of partnership and encourage Bob to find a middle ground.
* **Strategic Reserve:**  I'm still above my minimum price ($15,000) and have 7 rounds left, giving me room to negotiate if necessary.

This counteroffer is a strategic move that aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  It reduces the difference between my price and Bob's offer, making it more likely for him to accept.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  It demonstrates that I am open to finding a compromise.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  It keeps the price above my minimum acceptable level, protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, there's still room for improvement.
* **I have more time:**  I have 6 rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate and try to secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap further and reach a price that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me. I will also try to understand Bob's reasoning for his offer and address any concerns he might have."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  This offer is closer to your last proposal, and it allows me to cover my costs while still leaving some room for profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. How about $13,000?  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I have 4 rounds left, and with a bit more negotiation, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.
* **John is a strong backup:**  Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further and hopefully reach an agreement that meets my minimum requirement. I will also continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob and try to understand his concerns."
