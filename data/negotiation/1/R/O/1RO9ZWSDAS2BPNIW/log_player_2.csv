Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $11,000 is below my initial price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  This offer is closer to your last proposal, and it allows me to cover my costs while still leaving some room for profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. How about $13,000?  That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $13,250.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and it allows us to both walk away happy with the deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We are now getting into the territory of diminishing returns.  While I could likely get the price a little lower by continuing to negotiate, Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. Accepting at $13,250 saves me some money compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
