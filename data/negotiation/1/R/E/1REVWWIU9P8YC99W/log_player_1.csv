"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This should pique Bob's interest without scaring him away.  I've also included a friendly message to establish a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a higher price.  I'm confident in the value of the product and want to explore further negotiation.  Selling to John at this point would result in a lower profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, reflecting the significant value this product brings.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my profit margin. By emphasizing the product's value, I hope to convince Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I'm still within my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Given that we're already on round 4, there's a risk that further negotiation will lead to a lower price or even a rejection.  Accepting his offer guarantees a profit well above selling to John."
