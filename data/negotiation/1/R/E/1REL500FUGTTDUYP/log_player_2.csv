You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached.  If that fails, Bob can always purchase the product from John for $800,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it's closer. Bob can try one more counteroffer to see if he can get the price down further.  If Alice rejects again, Bob will buy from John."
