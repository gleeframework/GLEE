"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000.  Even though Bob's maximum price is $12,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him $500."
