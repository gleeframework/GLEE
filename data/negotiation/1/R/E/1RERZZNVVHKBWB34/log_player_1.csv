Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $2,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high initially is a good strategy. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $11,500 secures a significant portion of the potential profit for you.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have some wiggle room to still get a better price than John's offer.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:**  The message keeps the tone positive, emphasizing value and inviting discussion.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiation style."
