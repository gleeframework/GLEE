{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $130 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, so it's a reasonable starting point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls or looks unproductive, I can always switch to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would you be able to accommodate that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is firmly set on his budget, I still have room to negotiate. I can likely find a middle ground that's more favorable to me than $80.
* **John's Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob, as I don't need to accept a drastically low price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum price of $150. I'll try to find a compromise that's still profitable for me while being appealing to Bob. If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll re-evaluate the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well below what others would pay for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $80 and my previous offer of $130.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize that $110 is still a good deal for Bob, considering what others would pay. This can help him see the value of the product at this price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While this counteroffer is lower than my ideal price, it's still significantly above Bob's offer and ensures I'm not losing money. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's Counteroffer:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent profit while still satisfying Bob's budget constraints.
* **Rejecting Bob's Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects, I might consider making another counteroffer, but I'll be cautious. If the negotiation becomes too tedious or Bob's offers continue to be too low, I'll  go with my guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still looking to keep my spending under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While closer, it still represents a considerable loss for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown willingness to move from his initial $80. However, I don't want to compromise too much.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** With John offering $150, I'm in a strong position to hold out for a more favorable price. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer, and I don't want to risk accepting a price too far below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100. This will show him I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get the product you want while I still get a reasonable return.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $95 represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer of $90 while still being above my previous offer of $90. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that $95 is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Balancing Profit and Sales:**  While $95 is still below my ideal price, it's significantly closer to my minimum of $150.  This counteroffer helps balance my desire for profit with the possibility of closing the deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I will reconsider my options. I can continue to counteroffer, but I'll be mindful of the time and effort involved. If Bob's offers continue to be too low, I'll switch to John and secure my guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still committed to staying within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $85 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, despite several rounds of negotiation. 
* **Unlikely Increase:**  Bob has shown a clear unwillingness to move much higher, and continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150.  This is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's low offer and losing out on a substantial amount of money.

**Next Steps:**

I will choose to sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed profit. This is the most advantageous option, as it avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob and ensures I receive a fair price for the product."
