Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, by offering a price that's a reasonable increase from my minimum, I'm trying to find a sweet spot between maximizing profit and potentially securing a sale.
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net, allowing me to be more aggressive with my pricing without the fear of losing all potential profit. 

By offering $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit."
