{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a good deal for me while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.  It's important to be polite and make it clear I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, I'm looking to pay closer to $12000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still less than I'd like.  I'll try to push for a higher price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
