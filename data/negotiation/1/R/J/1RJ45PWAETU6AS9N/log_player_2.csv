(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to establish a starting point for negotiation.  This price is below Alice's minimum, but it allows for room to compromise.  I'm hoping Alice will counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  There's still room for Alice to come down, and I want to exhaust my negotiation options before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for compromise. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also signaling that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's getting closer, I'm determined to try and secure a lower price. I'm confident that I can negotiate further and get a better deal.  I have enough rounds left to continue the negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Alice to come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push with this counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer again, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer and within my budget. This offer demonstrates my seriousness and willingness to reach an agreement, but it also leaves little room for further negotiation.  If Alice rejects this, I'm likely going to purchase from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's only slightly higher than what I would pay John. Considering that I have limited rounds left, it makes more sense to accept this offer and close the deal. Further negotiation may result in a lower price, but it risks me losing the deal altogether."
