Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and appreciate your time. I am willing to pay $125 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I can only commit to $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. It's better to secure the sale now than to continue negotiating and potentially end up selling to John for a lower price."
