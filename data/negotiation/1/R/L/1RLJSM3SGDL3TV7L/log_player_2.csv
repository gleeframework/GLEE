"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value to me. Considering its worth and the potential it offers, I am extending this exclusive offer to you. If you're interested in exploring this further, I would like to propose a price of $12000 for the product. This price reflects its true value while allowing for a fair negotiation point. Let's discuss how we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Since your maximum budget is $8,000, and John is willing to sell for that price, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
