"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000, and John is offering the product for that price, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice. You can secure the product immediately by buying from John."
