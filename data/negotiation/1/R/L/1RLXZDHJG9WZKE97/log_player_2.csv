Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
