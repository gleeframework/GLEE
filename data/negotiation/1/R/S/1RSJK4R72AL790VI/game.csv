"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs perfectly and I believe it's worth more than its actual cost. Would you like to purchase it for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, given its worth to me.  Let me know if you're open to that.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer of $90, but let's also explore if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $105 for the product?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. It's fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see, Bob. Thank you for maintaining your position. I respect your decision and would like to offer the product to you for $100, which is its perceived value to you. This way, we can both feel satisfied with the transaction.",100.0,Alice,5,
