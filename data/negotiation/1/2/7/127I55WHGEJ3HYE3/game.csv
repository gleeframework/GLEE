"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its exceptional quality and benefits. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I'm not comfortable meeting you at $900000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, so I'd like to reiterate that I have other interested parties, including John, who is willing to buy the product for $800000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm not convinced that $1050000 is a fair price, especially considering John's offer of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $975000. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see that you're trying to drive the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1025000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'd like to remind you that John is still waiting in the wings with his offer of $800000. I'm willing to give you a bit more time to think, but I need a serious commitment from you soon.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1025000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to consider John's offer. Can you meet me at $975000 or we can discuss other options?",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're considering John's offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $975000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1000000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $800000. I'm giving you one last chance to make a decision.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
