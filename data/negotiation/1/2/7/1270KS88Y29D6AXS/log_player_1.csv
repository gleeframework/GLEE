"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $110, so I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about $120? I'm confident this product is worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $115. I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $115 is closer to my target, I think I can still push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $118.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 118}
