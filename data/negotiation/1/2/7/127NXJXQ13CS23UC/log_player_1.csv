Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a compromise price:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **The message is positive and persuasive:** It emphasizes the good deal for Bob and the win-win scenario. 
* **This strategy is based on maximizing profit:** 
    * If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $2,000.
    * If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000.

This approach balances maximizing profit with the potential for a quicker sale to Bob."
