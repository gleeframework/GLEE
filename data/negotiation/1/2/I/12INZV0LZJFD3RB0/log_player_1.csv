``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my ideal.  If Bob rejects, I can still try to negotiate further or fall back on my deal with John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,500 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value.  I'll try to find a compromise that is mutually beneficial."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe I've found a way to meet somewhere in the middle. Would $8,750 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired range. I will reject his offer and continue to negotiate. I will try to make a counteroffer that is closer to $9,000, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price."
