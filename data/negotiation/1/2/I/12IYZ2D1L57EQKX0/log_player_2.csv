"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. Since you have no information about the product's value to Alice, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is a substantial discount, which may encourage Alice to consider a counteroffer. This also gives me room to negotiate upward in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $1,200,000 is still too high. There's more room for negotiation. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, but still staying significantly below Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while trying to reach a price closer to my target. I'm aiming to find a middle ground and see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a significant drop from her initial price. This is close to my previous counteroffer, and accepting it would be a good deal. Given the limited number of rounds, there's a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and ending up paying $1,500,000 to John.  Accepting the offer secures the purchase at a good price."
