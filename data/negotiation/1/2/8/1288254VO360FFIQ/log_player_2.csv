"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $200 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product but would be happy to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's initial counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's original price,  showing his serious interest but also setting a clear boundary. This move allows for negotiation without immediately going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $175, though. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's acceptable range. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but he's still staying within his budget. This counteroffer signals his commitment while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's price range, $160 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. Since Bob is willing to pay $120 from John, it's still worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $160 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference at $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets the deal done.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a compromise price of $150, demonstrating his commitment to finding a solution while still being cautious.  This offer also leaves room for potential counteroffers from Alice."
