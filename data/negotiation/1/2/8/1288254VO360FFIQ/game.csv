"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product but would be happy to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $175, though. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this happen.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's still a great deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $160 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference at $150. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets the deal done.  What do you say?",150.0,Bob,6,
