Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product represents significant value, but $1,800,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to pay.  To keep this moving, I can offer $700,000."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I need to see a more serious offer to continue this discussion.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and John's offer. There's little incentive to continue negotiating when you have a guaranteed option at $800,000."
