,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  It's  a fair bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still well below the value this product holds for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's worth a lot to both of us. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",812500.0,Alice,5,
