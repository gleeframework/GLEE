Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price:** While $9,000 is better than John's offer of $8,000, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay more by highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the win-win potential of a deal closer to my original offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original $12,000, aiming to find a compromise that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing that even at $10,500, he's getting a good deal.
* **Encouraging closure:** I'm using language that encourages Bob to accept the offer and close the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price that's closer to my desired price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next offer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or sell the product to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 away from my absolute minimum of $9,000.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a real chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer of $8,000.
* **Opportunity cost:**  The extra $500 is worth the risk of potentially losing Bob as a buyer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and move forward with the sale, ensuring a profit and avoiding the risk of ending up with John's lower offer."
