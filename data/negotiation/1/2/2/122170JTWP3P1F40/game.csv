"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While your valuation is understandable, the product's intrinsic value and potential ROI justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this offer reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
