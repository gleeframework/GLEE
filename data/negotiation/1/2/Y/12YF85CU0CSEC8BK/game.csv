"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's unique features and benefits.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground here. I'm prepared to offer $9000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
