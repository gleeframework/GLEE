"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that has a lot of value to it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I think this is a great price considering its unique features and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as the value of the product to Alice might be even lower than what she's offering now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground here. I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $9500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer, it's still above his budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable going above my budget. I'm offering $9,200 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your position.  Let's see if we can find a solution here."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $9800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has made several counteroffers, and Alice has also made concessions, but they still haven't reached a price that is acceptable to both parties. With only a few rounds remaining, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that they will reach an agreement.  Since Bob has a reliable alternative option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase the product from John."
