"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you might find valuable. I'm asking for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $115.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and there's potential to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:**  If negotiations fail, you can still buy the product for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about saving money.  
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $105 is still above Alice's minimum value, giving her a reason to consider the offer.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and help determine if further concessions are possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, $110 is still above your desired range.
* **More negotiation is possible:** You've already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown some flexibility. There's potential to get closer to your target price. 
* **John's price is a safety net:**  If negotiations fail, you can still secure the product at a higher price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet halfway but still pushing for a lower price.
* **Focus on compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining negotiation momentum:**  By continuing to make offers, you keep the negotiation active and increase the chances of reaching a deal."
