Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 7250}"
