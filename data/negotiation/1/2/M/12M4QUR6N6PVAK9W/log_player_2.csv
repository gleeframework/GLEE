(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $9,500.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm motivated to sell, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. Let's try $12,000 - it's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high for Bob. At this point, it's better for Bob to accept the offer from John at $8,000 and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
