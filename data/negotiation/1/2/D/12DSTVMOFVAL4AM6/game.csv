"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $950,000. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant price point for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a significant price point for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is at least $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this exceptional product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm making a significant concession from my original offer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to know if it's acceptable to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
