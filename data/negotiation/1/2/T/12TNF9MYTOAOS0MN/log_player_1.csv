Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to ensure it fits within my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still feel that $1,025,000 is a bit high for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $985,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

It's tempting to try and push for more, but Bob is clearly committed to the negotiation and is consistently increasing his offer. Accepting $975,000 ensures a significant profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
