"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to test the waters and see how much Bob is willing to pay. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $800,000. I will counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above the guaranteed $800,000 from John. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though it's lower than my initial offer, it's still above the guaranteed $800,000 from John.  I believe there's still potential to reach a higher price with Bob, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a further concession from my previous offer but still above the guaranteed $800,000 from John. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000. Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm not confident I can reach a more favorable price in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me a reasonable profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
