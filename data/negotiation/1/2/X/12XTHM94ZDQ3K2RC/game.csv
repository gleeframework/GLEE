"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you'll get from it.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $950,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming closer to my price range, Alice.  How about $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
