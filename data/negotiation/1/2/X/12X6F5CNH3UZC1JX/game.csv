"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $140 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great product, and I think it's worth the investment.  What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
