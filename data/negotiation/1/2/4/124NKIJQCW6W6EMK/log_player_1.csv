Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a high offer of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This initial high price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if I started with a lower offer.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This gives me leverage to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he's unwilling to meet a price that's significantly profitable for me. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I am prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price to secure the sale, but I always aim to stay above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
