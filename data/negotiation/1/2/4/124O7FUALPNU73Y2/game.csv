"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900,000 for the product. I think this price is more in line with its value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which would be $825,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",825000.0,Alice,5,,
