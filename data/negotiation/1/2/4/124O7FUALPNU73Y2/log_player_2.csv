"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $825,000, and your goal is to save as much money as possible. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is a better deal at this point."
