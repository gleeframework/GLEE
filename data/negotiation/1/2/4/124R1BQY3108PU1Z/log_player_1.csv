Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium right away. If not, I can adjust my price in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While I'm not averse to selling for $8,000, I have 10 rounds and want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of your product, I am unable to meet your current offer of $8,500. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. Thank you for considering my proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob is firm on his $8,000 offer, it's probably best to accept. I've already rejected his offer once, and I'm not sure if I can push him higher. I'm happy to get the $8,000, as it's my minimum desired price."
