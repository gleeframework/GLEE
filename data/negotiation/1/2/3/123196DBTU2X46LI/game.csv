"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it,  which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $750,000. Considering your willingness to pay $750,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $787,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial deal.",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $787,500. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer the product for $810,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.",810000.0,Alice,5,
