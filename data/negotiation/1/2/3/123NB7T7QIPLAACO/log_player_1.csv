Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profits and keeping Bob interested.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than my minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, so I'm still getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** $950,000 is still $50,000 less than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving him with a potential profit. This makes the offer attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is hesitant, I can potentially negotiate further, offering a slightly lower price to secure the sale. 

This strategy increases my chances of getting a good price while also considering the possibility that Bob might reject the offer."
