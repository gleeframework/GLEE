"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair reflection of its worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This feels like a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product. ",750000.0,Bob,4,
