Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This feels like a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This feels like a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, it's clear further negotiation might be slow. John offers a guaranteed $800,000 which is more than Bob's current offer. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed profit now."
