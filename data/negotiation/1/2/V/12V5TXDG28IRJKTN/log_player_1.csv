"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a good profit. I know Bob values the product at $100, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation. I'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price of $120, I'm at risk of losing the deal with Bob entirely.  By accepting his offer of $110, I ensure a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation. It's better to take a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether."
