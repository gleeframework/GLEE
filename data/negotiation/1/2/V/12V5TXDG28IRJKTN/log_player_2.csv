"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $130.  
* **Rejecting makes sense:**  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 9 rounds left to make a deal with Alice.
* **Buying from John is a backup:** You can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Start low:**  Since the product is worth $100 to you, start with your maximum price. 
* **Aggressive but fair:**  This shows Alice you're serious about buying but won't overpay.
* **Room for compromise:** This leaves room for Alice to counteroffer a price that's still profitable for her while being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above what you're willing to pay.
* **Negotiation continues:**  You still have several rounds left to try and get a better deal with Alice. 
* **John is the backup:**  Remember, John's offer is always available if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Mid-point compromise:** This counteroffer is a halfway point between your initial offer of $100 and Alice's latest offer of $125.
* **Showing willingness to meet halfway:** This demonstrates your desire to reach an agreement, while still leaving some room for Alice to come down slightly.
* **Maintaining leverage:** You still have several rounds left and the option to buy from John, so you're not desperate to accept Alice's offer."
