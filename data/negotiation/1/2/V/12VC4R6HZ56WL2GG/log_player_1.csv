Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's an opportunity to earn more if Bob accepts a slightly lower price.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,500 is a strong offer. It's a significant saving for Bob compared to him finding a similar product elsewhere, while still giving you a $1,500 profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for John's guaranteed purchase."
