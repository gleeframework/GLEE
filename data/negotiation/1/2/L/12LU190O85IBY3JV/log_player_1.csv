**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I am open to negotiation, but I'm setting a strong starting point.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and my own fallback option of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $700000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I will counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price."

Let's continue this discussion to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  Considering my budget constraints and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $800000. This would allow us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. It's a win-win situation as I'm able to sell the product at my minimum desired price while Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with. Further negotiation would be unnecessary and time-consuming."
