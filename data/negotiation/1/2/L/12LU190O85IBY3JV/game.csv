"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return. Please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $700000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return for you.  To find a mutually beneficial solution, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This represents a significant investment, but I believe it's fair given the product's potential.  Let's continue this discussion to find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  Considering my budget constraints and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $800000. This would allow us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
