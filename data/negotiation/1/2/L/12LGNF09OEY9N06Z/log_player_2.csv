"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her. It's worth negotiating to try and get a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so it's reasonable to reject the initial offer and attempt to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to both of us, and it leaves room for us to both benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This price is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer and push the price higher.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the potential for the deal to fall apart."
