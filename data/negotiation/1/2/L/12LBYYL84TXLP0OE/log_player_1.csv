Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation at $1,100,000 gives him a good deal while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and encouraging a quick decision can motivate Bob to accept before he hesitates or reconsiders. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is strong, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid having to sell to John at the lower price."
