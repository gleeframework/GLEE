"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We're nearing the end of our negotiations and while Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time and the risk of not closing the deal is becoming higher. John offers a guaranteed price that exceeds my minimum and I'm choosing to sell to him."
