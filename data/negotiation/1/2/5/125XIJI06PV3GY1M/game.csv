"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum and still a good value for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $11,125? That's a fair price for both of us.",11125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can we make a deal at this price?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but I'm still hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is the lowest I'm willing to pay. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option for me.",10500.0,Bob,6,
