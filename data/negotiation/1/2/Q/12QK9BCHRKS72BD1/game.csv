"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Considering its worth to you and the market value, I propose we set the price at $120. This allows us to share the value while ensuring you get a fair deal. Let me know if this works for you!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This offers a slight compromise, allowing us to move forward with the transaction while still ensuring a reasonable return for the product. I look forward to your consideration.",100.0,Alice,3,
