"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,100,000.  It's a great deal considering the value it brings.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm framing the price in terms of value to Bob, emphasizing the benefit he'll get. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation open for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable product. Based on my budget considerations, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance I can get closer to my target price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even if I don't reach a deal with Bob, I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 sale with John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, it's significantly below what I can accept.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but it allows for some flexibility on my end. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  It's important to show respect and acknowledge Bob's position, even if you reject it.
* **Offer a compromise:** I'm lowering the price to $1,050,000, which is still a significant amount but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm again highlighting the product's worth,  even while offering a lower price, to emphasize the opportunity for Bob. 
* **Open-ended question:**  This encourages continued dialogue and gives Bob a chance to express his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my research and the market value, I believe $1000000 is a fair price for the product. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is acceptable:** $1,000,000 is within my minimum acceptable price range of $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:** We're nearing the middle of the negotiation process (round 4 out of 10).
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting this offer might open the door to future business with Bob.

While I could potentially continue negotiating and aim for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether is significant. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and leaves room for future negotiations."
