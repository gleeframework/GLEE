Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your minimum, it's too early to accept Bob's offer. He's already shown interest and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows you to try for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $150. This is still a great value for the product, and it leaves us both happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $140. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is just $10 below my last counteroffer of $150.  This is a good deal, considering my minimum price is $120, and it's likely we won't get a better offer from Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
