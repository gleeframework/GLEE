,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This represents a significant discount on the value it offers and is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product, considering its worth and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
