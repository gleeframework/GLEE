{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum:** This creates room for negotiation without immediately making Bob walk away.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This allows Bob to understand the offer quickly.

It's important to remember that this is just the first step in the negotiation process. Depending on Bob's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $90? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a good bit closer to your price and would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for us both.  Let's split the difference. How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 85}
