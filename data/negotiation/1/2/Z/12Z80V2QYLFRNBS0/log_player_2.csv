"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is a bit high. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John, so you're better off trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice or going with your backup option."
