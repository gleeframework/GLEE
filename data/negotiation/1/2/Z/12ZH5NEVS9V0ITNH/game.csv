"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, that's a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  Could you maybe do $70? That would be a great price for me.",70.0,Bob,4,
