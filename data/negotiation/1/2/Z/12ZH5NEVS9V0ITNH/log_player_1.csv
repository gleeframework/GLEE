{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a little lower than what the product is worth to you, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate.  It's important to start the negotiation with a price that's high enough to leave some room for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, that's a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low.  While I want to make a deal, I won't sell it for less than what it's worth to me.  I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  Could you maybe do $70? That would be a great price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, $70 is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell it for less than what it's worth to me.  It's better to sell it to John and get the full value."
