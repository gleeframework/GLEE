Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable with my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's latest offer is getting a little too low for my comfort.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm concerned that we're getting too far away from my ideal price.  John is a reliable buyer who is already willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him."
