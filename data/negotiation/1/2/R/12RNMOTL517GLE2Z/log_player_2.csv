{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $12,000 to both of us, there's no immediate advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount.  This is a reasonable starting point, and I'll adjust my offers based on Alice's responses."

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm confident I can get a lower price, so I'll continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $11,200, which is only $200 more than my last offer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, we're getting close to a deal. It's not worth risking losing the opportunity for a small price difference."
