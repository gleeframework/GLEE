"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while considering your budget. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to go down to $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and go down to $125.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. That's the lowest I can go.",110.0,Bob,6,
