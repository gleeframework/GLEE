{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I'm going to analyze Bob's response to figure out the best strategy to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while considering your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to go down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to risk one more round of negotiation. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and go down to $125.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a high chance Bob won't budge further, and I risk losing time and ultimately accepting a price below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $150, which is the best outcome for me in this situation."
