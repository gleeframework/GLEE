"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my value for it and the potential benefits it brings. I hope you'll consider my offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $980,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
