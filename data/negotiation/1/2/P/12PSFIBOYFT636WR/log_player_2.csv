"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to share the value with you. Let's start by discussing a fair price. How about we aim for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still too high. While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worthwhile to explore potential counteroffers to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to continue the negotiation. Let's try to find a price that works well for both of us. How about we consider $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is still higher than my ideal price. Since I have more rounds to negotiate, I'll continue to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $95 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $92? I'm very serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. Considering our previous discussions, how about we set the price at $93 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $93 is still a bit more than my ideal price, I've already had four rounds of negotiation and I'm getting closer to my goal. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a much lower price in the remaining rounds.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price, and it's better than buying from John for $120."
