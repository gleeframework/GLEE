"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $135, which is a great price considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial valuation, it's still above your maximum price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to reach out. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $120.  I'd be willing to buy it at that price if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $125 to make this work.  Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your maximum. Since John is offering the product for $120, it's the most cost-effective option for you."
