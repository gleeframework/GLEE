Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $100. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Asking for Feedback:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I'm prompting Bob to give me his initial reaction and potentially reveal some information about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can likely get more from Bob. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This reflects the quality and value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Reasoning:**  I've provided a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the product's quality and value. This helps Bob understand why I'm not willing to go lower yet.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
