{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $15000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum price.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. This product is truly unique and worth more. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $12000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $9000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum and avoids further negotiation."
