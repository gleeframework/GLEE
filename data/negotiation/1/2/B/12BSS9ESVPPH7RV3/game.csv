"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $15000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know if you're open to that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is just too low for me. This product is truly unique and worth more. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle on this.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. However, $12000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $9000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
