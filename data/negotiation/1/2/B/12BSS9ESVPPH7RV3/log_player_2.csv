``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is just too low for me. This product is truly unique and worth more. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
