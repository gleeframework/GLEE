Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Since Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the minimum I am willing to accept, I will offer him the product at that price. This ensures I get the maximum profit and also gives Bob a fair deal. If he rejects the offer, I can sell the product to John for the same price, so there's no risk involved in offering this price to Bob."
