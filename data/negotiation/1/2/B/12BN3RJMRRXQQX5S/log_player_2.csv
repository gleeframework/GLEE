"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, I want to see if I can get it lower. There are 9 more rounds, and I can always buy from John for $120 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum while still leaving room for bargaining.  If Alice rejects this, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is closer to my maximum, I still want to see if I can get it lower.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer than before, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant about $90. How about we settle at $85? It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to meet in the middle and encourages Alice to accept.  The counteroffer is still below my maximum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
