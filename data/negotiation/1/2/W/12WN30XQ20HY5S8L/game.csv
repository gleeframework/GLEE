"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
