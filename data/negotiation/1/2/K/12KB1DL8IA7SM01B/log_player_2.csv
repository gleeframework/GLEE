"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There's no immediate reason to buy from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, $1,000,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,150,000. This reflects my strong belief in the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and there's room for further negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining.  There's no reason to buy from John at this point, as the price is higher than what Alice is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a better deal.  Let's try $1,100,000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome and ensures a smooth transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
