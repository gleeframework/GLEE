Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,500,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. However, $1,000,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,150,000. This reflects my strong belief in the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a better deal.  Let's try $1,100,000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome and ensures a smooth transaction.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate the best possible price, but $1,100,000 is a solid profit, well above my minimum. It's time to close the deal."
