Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is the most I can afford right now.  Let me know if that's something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $90. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy it right now. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.
