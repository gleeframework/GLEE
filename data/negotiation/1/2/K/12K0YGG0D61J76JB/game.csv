"Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is the most I can afford right now.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is my initial asking price, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet halfway at $140?  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $90. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy it right now. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",90.0,Bob,4,
