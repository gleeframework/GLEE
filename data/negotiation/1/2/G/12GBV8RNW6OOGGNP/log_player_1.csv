Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and tailoring the message to Bob's ""expertise"" adds perceived value, making the higher price more palatable."
