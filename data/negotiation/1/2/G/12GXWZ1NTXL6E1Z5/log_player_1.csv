{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$130** is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and inviting, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my minimum value of $150.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows Bob to feel involved in the process, making him more likely to accept an offer.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves unreasonable, ensuring I get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By refusing his initial counteroffer, I demonstrate my unwillingness to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Potentially increase the price:**  Rejecting his offer encourages Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:**  I still have the safety net of selling to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120** represents a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer of $130 and Bob's counteroffer of $100. 
* **The message** remains friendly and emphasizes fairness, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer:

* **Demonstrates flexibility:** It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own profit.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** It avoids an impasse and encourages Bob to potentially accept the offer or make a higher counteroffer.
* **Maintains the option to sell to John:** I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum value of $150, it's still not high enough. I'm not willing to compromise further, particularly since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By refusing his latest counteroffer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and am prepared to walk away if needed. 
* **Potentially push for a higher price:**  Rejecting his offer might encourage Bob to make a final, more appealing offer.
* **Keep the option to sell to John:**  I have a secure alternative in John, ensuring I'll get my minimum value if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm not willing to go down to $110, I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $115? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$115** is a final attempt to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. 
* **The message** remains friendly and focuses on fairness, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the deal:** By offering a price that's a reasonable compromise, I'm hoping to convince Bob to accept the deal.
* **Maximize profit:** While $115 is less than my initial goal, it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Minimize risk:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose out on a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is simply too low.  It's significantly below my minimum value of $150, and I'm not willing to take such a significant loss.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm confident that I can get a better price by selling to John.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John guarantees me:

* **Maximum Profit:**  I get my minimum value of $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.
* **Minimized Risk:**  There's no chance of losing money or settling for a price that's too low. 
* **Efficient Outcome:**  I avoid further negotiation with Bob, saving time and effort."
