,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be interested in buying the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to make a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
