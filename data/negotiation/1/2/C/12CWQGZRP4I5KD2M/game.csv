"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm going to counter with a price of $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll derive from the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
