"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe the product is valuable, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10000. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $17000? That's still a great deal, and I think we can find a happy medium there.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle, at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $16000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $16500? It's a fair price, and we can finally close this deal.",16500.0,Alice,5,
