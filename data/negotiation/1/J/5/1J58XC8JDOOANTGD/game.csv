"Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives you a significant discount and keeps the negotiation moving forward.",9500.0,Alice,5,
