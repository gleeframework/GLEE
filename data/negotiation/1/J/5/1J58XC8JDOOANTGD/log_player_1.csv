"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message establishes a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning the value of the product can make Bob more inclined to consider the offer.

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation open. By starting at $12,000, I can potentially get a better price than John's offer, while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer given his low budget, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate but also my determination to secure a price closer to my desired value. This will likely prompt Bob to offer a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget and signal my willingness to negotiate by offering a middle ground price.
* **Value proposition:** I highlight the value Bob will get by emphasizing a ""good deal"" at $10,000.
* **Maintain firmness:**  I'm not dropping too much, showing I value the product.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is more appealing to both of us, increasing the likelihood of a deal in this round. It allows for a potential win-win scenario where I secure a price closer to my minimum while Bob still gets a better deal than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it's still below my desired value. I'm confident that I can secure a better price, especially since I'm willing to continue negotiating.  Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but I want to see if I can get closer to that amount through negotiations with Bob.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm determined to get a higher price. This keeps the negotiation alive and encourages Bob to come back with a more competitive offer. I'm still holding out for a price closer to $10,000, but I'm open to a slight compromise if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives you a significant discount and keeps the negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to budge by lowering my price from $10,000.
* **Highlight the discount:**  I emphasize the ""significant discount"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Focus on progress:**  I tie the offer to keeping the negotiation ""moving forward,"" suggesting a willingness to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated compromise. I'm lowering my price slightly, but still holding out for a better price than Bob's last offer. This keeps the pressure on Bob while demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution. It also increases the likelihood that we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
