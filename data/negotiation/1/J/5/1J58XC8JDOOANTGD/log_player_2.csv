"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, and he's willing to pay a maximum of $8,000.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is too high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for a better price, potentially closer to Bob's target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're really trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives you a significant discount and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $9,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more sense for him to take that deal and avoid further negotiation.  This ensures he gets the product at his target price and avoids potentially getting stuck at a higher price."
