"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's best to start by rejecting Alice's offer. You're looking to pay $8,000 or less, so there's room for negotiation.  You'll want to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still looking to get the price below $8,500, and Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's a chance you can get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I think it's a good starting point for reaching an agreement.  Let's work together to get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $9,250 is a better offer than before, it's still above your target price of $8,000.  You've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is unlikely to come down much further. It's better to go with John's offer at this point and secure the product for your target price."
