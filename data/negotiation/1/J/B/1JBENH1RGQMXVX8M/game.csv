"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $110. This is a great deal for a product of this quality, and it's closer to what I need to make it worthwhile for me. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
