"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and allows for a fair profit margin for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 still falls short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1050000? This gives you a good price, and allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1020000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I hope you can meet me halfway.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
