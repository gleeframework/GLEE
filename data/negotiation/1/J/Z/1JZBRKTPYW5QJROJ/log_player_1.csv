{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. It's also significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to potentially get a better deal without jeopardizing my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I'll counter with a higher price, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,080,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to push the price a bit higher before potentially selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,060,000. I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and the negotiation seems to be getting less productive. I'm confident that I can get a much better price from John, so I'll sell to him instead."
