"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm happy to start the negotiation at $17,000.  Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $15,500 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,750?",14750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,750 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm going to stand firm at $15,250.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $14,750. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",14750.0,Bob,6,
