Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try and get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $15,500 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below $15,000. I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round.  There's still a chance that Bob might come up a little more, and I don't want to miss out on the possibility of earning more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,750 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm going to stand firm at $15,250.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 15250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $14,750. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob has made it clear he won't go any higher.  While I'd like to get more, I'm not sure he'll budge.  To avoid further negotiation and potential loss, I'll sell to John for $15,000. It's a guaranteed deal and meets my minimum acceptable price."
