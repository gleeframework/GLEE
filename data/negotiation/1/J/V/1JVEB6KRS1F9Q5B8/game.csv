"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little lower than I can go. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",87.5,Bob,4,
