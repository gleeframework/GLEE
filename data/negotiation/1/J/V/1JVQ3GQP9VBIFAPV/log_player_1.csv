"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to negotiate. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I have some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue negotiating, it's not guaranteed I'll get a better price and I risk losing the deal entirely."
