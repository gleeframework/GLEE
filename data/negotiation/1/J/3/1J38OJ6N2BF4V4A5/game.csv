"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company.  It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $850,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",850000.0,Alice,1,
