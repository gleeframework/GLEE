Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $800,000, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to counter with a lower price without you feeling like you're giving away too much.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This offer is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, allowing you to negotiate down if needed. 

**Why this strategy?** 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob while keeping your options open.  You can always walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet your expectations. By starting with a higher price, you encourage negotiation and increase the chances of Bob accepting a price that's beneficial for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept the offer due to the fear of losing a potential buyer, it's crucial to prioritize your own financial interests.

**Next Steps:**

You should reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation.  You can make a counteroffer that is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to your desired price. This allows you to continue exploring potential value while keeping your options open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to your minimum:**  $900,000 is closer to your minimum price of $1,200,000, giving you a better chance of achieving your goal while still acknowledging Bob's financial limitations.
* **Maintain the negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and encourages Bob to make a move towards your desired price. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message emphasizes your willingness to compromise while still highlighting the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you can continue to negotiate by either making further concessions or choosing to sell to John. You can analyze Bob's response and the potential for further negotiation to determine the best course of action."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $850,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired range. Accepting his offer would mean a significant financial loss for you, as you value the product at $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:**

You should reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation. You can counteroffer with a price between $850,000 and your minimum of $1,200,000. This will allow you to explore further compromises while still protecting your financial interests. It's also important to consider the potential for future negotiations and the possibility of a better offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This price is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** This counteroffer signals your willingness to reach a deal while still protecting your financial interests.
* **Fair compromise:** The price is closer to Bob's offer but still above his initial counteroffer, creating a potential win-win scenario.
* **Pressure to close:** By emphasizing this as your final offer, you increase the pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to potentially close the deal with Bob while keeping your options open. Analyze Bob's response carefully and be prepared to either accept his offer (if it's close to your minimum) or sell to John."
