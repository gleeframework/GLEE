Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John provides a safety net at $800,000, Bob values the product much higher. Aiming high initially allows for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $925,000 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but well above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite discussion and potential counter-offers from Bob. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while acknowledging the potential need to negotiate with Bob."
