"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. This is the highest I can go considering my current financial situation.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but $8,500 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit above my budget, though.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is still below your halfway point but allows for some profit for you. Let's work together to find a solution that's fair to both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product. However, $10,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a good compromise considering my budget and your need for a profit.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about we meet at $10,000? It's the minimum I can accept, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,7,
