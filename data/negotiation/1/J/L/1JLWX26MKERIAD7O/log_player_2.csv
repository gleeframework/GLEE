```

**Explanation:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. This is the highest I can go considering my current financial situation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but $8,500 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely negotiate a lower price, especially since you're willing to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit above my budget, though.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is still below your halfway point but allows for some profit for you. Let's work together to find a solution that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high for my budget.  It's closer to my budget than before, but I'm still willing to risk walking away and buying from John, as I'm only willing to spend up to $8,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product. However, $10,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a good compromise considering my budget and your need for a profit.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about we meet at $10,000? It's the minimum I can accept, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still too high for me.  While we're getting closer, it's still outside of my budget, and we're running out of time.  I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $8,000.  It's a better deal for me and I don't want to risk spending any more than I need to."
