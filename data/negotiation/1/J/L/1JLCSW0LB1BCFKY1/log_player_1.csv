Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $120 (its value to you) and guarantee a sale to John, there's room to make more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it at $119 is just below your guaranteed price. This tempts Bob with a good deal while still giving you a profit above your minimum. 
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob values the product at $100. By pricing it at $119, you're still offering it at a price lower than his perceived value.  

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale."
