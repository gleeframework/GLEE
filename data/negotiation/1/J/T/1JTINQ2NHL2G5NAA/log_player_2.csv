Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. How about $1,075,000? It's a good compromise and gives us both a chance to make this deal work.
