"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  It also establishes the value of the product in Bob's eyes.  We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can get more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant drop from my original offer, showing Bob I'm serious about selling, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will entice him to come up a bit."
