"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door for a better deal, either from Alice in a counter-offer or by sticking with John's offer."
