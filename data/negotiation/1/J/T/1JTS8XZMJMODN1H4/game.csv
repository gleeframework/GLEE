"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential gain. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's significantly less than what I'd pay John.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid any further negotiation.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is as close to your target price as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $10,000.",11250.0,Alice,5,
