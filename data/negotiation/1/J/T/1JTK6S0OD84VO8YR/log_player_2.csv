"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget and lower than John's price. It's a good deal, so accepting it saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation."
