Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000.  This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to maximize my potential earnings. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a price that leaves room for negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  However, I'm always aware of the $1,500,000 guaranteed offer from John, which sets a floor for my acceptable price."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. Bob's offer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $2,000,000.  I still have 8 rounds left, so I have time to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin. I believe this price is a fair midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.

If Bob accepts, I get a good price. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his next offer. I'm still confident I can get a better price than $1,800,000, and I'm not ready to settle for that yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is very close to my target price. While I would have loved to get closer to $2,000,000, I have to consider that we are already halfway through the negotiation process.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and getting stuck with the $1,500,000 offer from John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and a successful negotiation."
