"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is better than my minimum of $1,200,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. There are still 9 rounds left, and I can use this time to try to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $1,400,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,600,000?  I believe this price is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and we've reached a middle ground.  With more rounds remaining, there's a chance I could lose out on this offer and end up selling to John at a lower price."
