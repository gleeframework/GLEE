Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130:** This price is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150. This allows for negotiation space.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful negotiation. By starting with a slightly lower price than your minimum acceptable price, you signal your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would mean losing a significant amount of money. It's better to try and negotiate further with Bob to reach a price closer to your desired range.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially increase the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price,  $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $115?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $115, which is halfway between Bob's offer of $100 and my previous offer of $130.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's interest while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm aiming for a compromise while still holding firm on a price that's more favorable to me.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while pushing for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $105? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm unwilling to accept such a significant loss. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to make a final counteroffer before selling to John.  I need to find a way to push Bob a bit higher without risking losing him completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. Let's make one last attempt to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is my final offer, and it's a good deal considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final offer, signaling to Bob that there is little room for further negotiation.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105.
* **Value emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price.

This counteroffer aims to secure a deal closer to my minimum acceptable price while remaining open to a compromise. If Bob rejects this, I will sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one last attempt to find a price that works for both of us. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer of $107.5 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Further negotiation would likely lead to more back-and-forth and potentially a lower final price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150, which is a much better deal for me."
