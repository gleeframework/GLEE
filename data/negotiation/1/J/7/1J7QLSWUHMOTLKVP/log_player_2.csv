"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is asking for $175. This is way too much. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is still asking too much. While she's come down a bit, $155 is still outside my budget. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $125? It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $140. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I've already rejected her twice, and we're only on round 5. I'm not confident that I can get her down to my desired price, and I don't want to risk wasting more time. I'm going to buy the product from John for $100."
