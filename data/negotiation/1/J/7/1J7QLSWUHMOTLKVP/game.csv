"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",175.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $175 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $125? It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $140. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",140.0,Alice,5,
