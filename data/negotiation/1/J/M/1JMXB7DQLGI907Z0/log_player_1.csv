I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my minimum price.  $90 is still too low.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

I'm still holding out for a bit more.  $95 is closer to my minimum, but I'm going to see if I can get Bob to go up just a little more."

Bob is clearly not going to budge much further and we're running out of rounds. It's time to sell to John and secure my minimum price."
