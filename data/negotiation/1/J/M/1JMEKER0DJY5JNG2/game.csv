"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $175 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $135 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $122?",122.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $122 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $128?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,AcceptOffer
