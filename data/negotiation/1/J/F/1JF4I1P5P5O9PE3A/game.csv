"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a fair margin for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
