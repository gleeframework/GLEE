{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be happy to sell it to you for $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and still allows for a fair margin for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair price that allows me to get a good deal while still recognizing the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it's still a profitable sale.  Accepting this offer is the best decision as I am likely to get a better price if I continue to negotiate with Bob."
