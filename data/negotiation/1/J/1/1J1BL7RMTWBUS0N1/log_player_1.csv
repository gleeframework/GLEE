{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts by building a relationship with Bob and highlighting the product's value. It also sets a price that is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation, aiming for a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
