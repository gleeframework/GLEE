Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal while also leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if he accepts, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $115? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $112? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $112 is still below my minimum threshold of $120.  While I'd like to get a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  It's best to take John's offer of $120 and move on."
