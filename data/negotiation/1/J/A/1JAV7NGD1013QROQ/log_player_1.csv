Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $900,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still represents a great value for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with selling for that price. I believe I can get a higher price with some more negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This would be a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a bit above my original target, but I think it's a fair price for this product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $980,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $1,000,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay that price. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $980,000 is still slightly below my minimum. To make this deal work, I need to get at least $990,000.  It's a small difference, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. Let's close this deal at $990,000."", ""product_price"": 990000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to get at least $990,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and it seems unlikely he'll budge much further.  John is a guaranteed buyer, and I don't want to risk losing that deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
