``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $92 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hopeful I can get a slightly better deal. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $92 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $95.  Although it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited number of rounds left.  I don't want to risk losing out on the sale entirely by pushing for a higher price."
