"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132.50 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially getting a price that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $130.  Let's try $131.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $131 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to come down further.  Rather than risk further negotiation rounds and potentially losing the product, it's more prudent for Bob to buy the product from John for $120.  This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potential delays or complications."
