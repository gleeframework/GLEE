"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly below my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I believe I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. This would be a good compromise for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price point. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $130.  Let's try $131.  This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 131}
```"
