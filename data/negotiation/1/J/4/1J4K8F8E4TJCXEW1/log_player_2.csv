Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you like the compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $105. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $105. To maximize savings, it's better to buy from John at $100."
