"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product for a price that is sure to benefit you significantly. Given its worth to you, I believe a price of $1,200,000 would be fair to both of us. This allows you substantial savings while still ensuring I receive a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. John's offer of $1,500,000 sets a high baseline, giving you leverage to counter-offer.  You might be able to get a better price from Alice."
