"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is a good step forward, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be.  How about we meet at $9,400? It's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a fair price for my product. What do you say?",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $9,300?",9300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9,300.  I'm getting closer to where I need to be. Let's split the difference and settle at $9,350? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",9350.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still not comfortable with $9,350. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $9,325?",9325.0,Bob,8,
