"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum desired value ($12,000) than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the benefits of the deal for both of us. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm anticipating Bob will likely counter-offer, so I'm starting with a price that allows for some give and take."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Space:**  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum ($12,000).  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **Time & Leverage:** I have 8 rounds left, so I have time to continue negotiating.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a safety net. I can always sell to him if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** I'm framing $9,500 as a ""fair compromise,"" which makes it seem more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive to maintain a good relationship with Bob. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum desired price, giving me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500. How about $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,250 is closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate up.  I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum of $12,000.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 6 rounds left, giving me time to push for a better price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer remains a safety net, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer if it's not good enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is a good step forward, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be.  How about we meet at $9,400? It's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a fair price for my product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm proposing a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm taking his offer seriously but still pushing for a higher price.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using phrases like ""meet halfway"" and ""closer to your offer"" to frame the negotiation as a collaborative effort.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to avoid alienating Bob.
* **Still Above My Minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum desired price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $9,300? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $9,300 is getting closer to my desired price, but I still see room for improvement.
* **Time and Leverage:** I still have 4 rounds remaining, which gives me time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $12,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to take a risk and keep negotiating without immediate pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9,300.  I'm getting closer to where I need to be. Let's split the difference and settle at $9,350? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** I'm proposing a compromise that splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, suggesting a final and agreeable price point.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair for both of us,"" emphasizing mutual benefit and encouraging a sense of closure. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm expressing a desire to ""finally close this deal,"" creating urgency and hinting at the potential for a successful outcome. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:** I'm still above my minimum desired price, but I'm recognizing the need to be flexible in order to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9,350. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $9,325? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,325. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,325
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Leverage:**  With only 2 rounds left, my leverage is decreasing. Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. 
* **Time Pressure:** The pressure is mounting to close a deal, and my time is running out.  
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** John's offer of $12,000 is a guaranteed sale, providing a much better outcome than the current negotiation with Bob.  
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of not closing a deal with either Bob or John is too high.  John's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's acceptable."
