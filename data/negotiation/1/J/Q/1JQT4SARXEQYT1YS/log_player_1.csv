Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiation by expressing openness to his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my ideal price."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer. How about $11125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation could take more time.  Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but I'd rather get this deal done now."
