"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start with an offer of $150. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum budget. While the product might be valuable, there's no immediate incentive to accept.  Rejecting allows for potential negotiation and hopefully a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $100, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $125?  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It acknowledges her valuation while still presenting a substantial savings for Bob.  The message also attempts to build a rapport by thanking her and showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget and am willing to meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $137.50 for the product. I hope this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway, bringing the price down to $137.50. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than his initial maximum budget of $150 and within his desired range.  Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
