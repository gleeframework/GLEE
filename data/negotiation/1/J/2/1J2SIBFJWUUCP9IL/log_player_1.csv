``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we could reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.
