"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we could reach an agreement quickly.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's reach a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
