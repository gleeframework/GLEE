"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still more than what you are willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better deal.  You have room to negotiate and can potentially get a price closer to your desired maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we could reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still more than you are willing to pay but it's significantly closer to your desired price point. You could potentially continue negotiating, but the risk is that Alice could push back further, and you might end up having to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,150,000 is the best option at this point, as it saves you some money and gets you the product you want."
