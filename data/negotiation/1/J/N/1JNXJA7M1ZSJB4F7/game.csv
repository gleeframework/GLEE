"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still outside my range.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $10,250. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look at other options.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,750. This is already a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to offer $10,100.  It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact I'm ready to close the deal.  This is my final offer.",10100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. I've already discounted the price significantly, and I think this is a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,7,
