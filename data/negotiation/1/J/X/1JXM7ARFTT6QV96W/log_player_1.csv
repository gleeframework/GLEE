Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", 
 ""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Since I know Bob values the product at $100 and I value it at a minimum of $100, starting with a higher price gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While selling to John is always an option, Bob offering $100 means he sees value in the product. There's still room to negotiate a price that's higher than $100 but lower than my initial offer, making it a better deal for both of us than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130?"", 
 ""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer ($150) and his offer ($100). This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $120 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $120 is a reasonable compromise. It's a decent profit margin above my minimum, and since he's stated it's his final offer, pushing further might make him walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
