"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $9,000. How about we settle at $8,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750.  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it's a fair offer considering we're getting close to my limit.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $9,000, but I need to think about whether it's worth continuing to negotiate further. If not, I'll have to consider selling it to John for $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,7,
