Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $9,000, but I need to think about whether it's worth continuing to negotiate further. If not, I'll have to consider selling it to John for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that she might sell to John for $8,000 if you don't accept. While you could push for a slightly lower price, there's a real risk Alice will walk away. Accepting at $9,000 guarantees you get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
