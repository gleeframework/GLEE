"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider coming down to $90? That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I need to make a profit, so I can't go any lower than that. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still stuck at $90. If you can meet me there, I'm ready to buy. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90. I'll meet you at $92.50, and that's as low as I can go.",92.5,Alice,7,
