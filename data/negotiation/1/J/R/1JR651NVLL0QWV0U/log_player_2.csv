```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110. Let me know if that's more to your liking.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider coming down to $90? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90. I'll meet you at $92.50, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $92.50 is still above your preferred price point, and you only have a few rounds left. You're very close to your budget, but you're also getting close to the end of the negotiations. To ensure you get the product within your budget, it's best to buy from John at $80."
