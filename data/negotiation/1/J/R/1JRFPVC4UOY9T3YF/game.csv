"Alice, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go above $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about getting the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. This is a great price for you, and it's still a good deal for me.",12000.0,Alice,5,
