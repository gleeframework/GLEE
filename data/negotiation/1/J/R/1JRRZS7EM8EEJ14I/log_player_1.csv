"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my desired price point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000, showing some flexibility but still aiming for a significant profit. This should encourage Bob to come up a bit higher in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer, it's still not enough to satisfy my target.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time.  Offering $10,500 shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is tempting, I still believe we can get closer to my target price.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm going to offer $10,200. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it signals my commitment to closing the deal. Hopefully, Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm still not at my ideal price point, $9,900 is a significant improvement over selling to John. There are only a few rounds left, and the risk of not closing the deal with Bob and ending up with John's offer is too high. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
