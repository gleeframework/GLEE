"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm really looking to get this product for $10,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really hoping to get this product for $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I really appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal, and I'm starting to think it's time to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. $11,000 is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,9,
