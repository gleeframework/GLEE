I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to show good faith, but still aim for a higher price than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,650,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still above Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get us to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,580,000.  It's a good price, and I'd rather not risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
