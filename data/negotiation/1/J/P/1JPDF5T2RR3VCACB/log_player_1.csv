Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm aware I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than Bob's offer.  I'll see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not high enough. I'd rather sell to John and guarantee myself a decent profit. The negotiation with Bob seems to be going nowhere, and I'm losing time and potential earnings."
