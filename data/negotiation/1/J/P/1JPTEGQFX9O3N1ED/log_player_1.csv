"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value is lower. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the benefit to Bob of buying the product at my price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear I'm open to discussion and negotiation, but not giving away the farm just yet."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, I still have time and leverage. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to squeeze out a bit more in the next round. I'm not giving up on getting closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are getting closer to my minimum target price of $1,200,000, but I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  

* **More room to negotiate:** With 6 rounds left, I have more time to potentially push Bob to a higher price.
* **Not rushing a deal:** I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to be patient.
* **Stronger position:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating I'm not afraid to walk away, which could make him more likely to come up in price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still holding firm at $970,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm showing that I'm not going to cave in easily. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By only dropping the price by a small amount, I'm keeping the pressure on Bob to come up.
* **Urgency:**  I'm reinforcing the idea that this is a good opportunity for Bob and shouldn't be missed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I am willing to consider $965,000 as a final offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $965,000 is very close to my minimum target of $1,200,000, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation is an art:**  Even though I'm getting closer, there's still potential for Bob to increase his offer a bit more. I'm not going to settle until I'm sure I can't squeeze out any more.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 4 more rounds before I have to sell to John, which means I have time to try and secure a better deal with Bob.
* **Setting a precedent:** By rejecting his offer, I might encourage Bob to come up in price for the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a little ways off.  I'm willing to go down to $970,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Not Giving in:** I'm staying firm with my previous counteroffer of $970,000. This demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and I believe in the value of the product.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a good price considering the value of the product to him.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that we need to make a decision to close the deal.
* **Small Concession:**  While I'm not dropping the price significantly, it shows that I'm willing to compromise a bit.

With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is on Bob to make a decision. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that we're still not quite there yet, Alice. I would like to propose one last offer of $962,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiation is getting very close to my minimum target price. However, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. Here's why:

* **Time is running out:**  Two rounds left is not enough time to guarantee that Bob will come up to my ideal price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Bob will reject my next counteroffer, leaving me with no deal and potentially no other options. 
* **Secure a Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum target.

While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, it's important to be realistic about the situation and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
