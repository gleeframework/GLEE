"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about $110? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go.,108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $108 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  $110 is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. My final offer is $107. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the purchase.",107.0,Bob,6,
