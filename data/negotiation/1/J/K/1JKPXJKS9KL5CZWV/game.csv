"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at this amount.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,200,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. While $1,200,000 is closer to my budget, I still can't justify spending that much. I'd like to propose a counteroffer at $950,000. This would be the highest I could realistically pay while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. It's closer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise and would allow both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I believe we can find a solution that works for both of us. I would like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the highest I can go while still respecting my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
