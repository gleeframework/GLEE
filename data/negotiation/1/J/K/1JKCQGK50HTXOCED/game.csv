"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. How about $7,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite comfortable with $7,800, Bob. I think the product's value is still worth more than that. How about we try $8,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a strict budget.  My final offer is $8,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
