"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. To be frank, $800,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $650,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $750,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting close to my limit, but how about $700,000? If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'll make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $725,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can meet in the middle once more.",725000.0,Alice,7,
