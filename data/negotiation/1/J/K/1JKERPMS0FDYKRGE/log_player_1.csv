prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose his potential profit.

**Strategy**

The ideal strategy is to offer a price that is appealing to Bob (meaning it's below his $1,500,000 valuation) while maximizing your profit.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll receive."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You acknowledge Bob's potential profit by calling out the ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant return on investment.""
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves a $150,000 profit for Bob (enough to entice him) while giving you a $350,000 profit above your guaranteed amount.
* **Confidence:**  You present the price with confidence, avoiding language like ""hoping"" or ""willing to negotiate further,"" which might make you seem less certain.

**Important Note:** While this is a strong starting point, negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer and have a plan for how you'll respond."
