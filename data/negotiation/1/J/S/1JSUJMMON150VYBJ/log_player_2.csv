"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be of great value to your business.  While I value this product at no less than $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1,200,000. This is a significant savings and a chance for you to secure a valuable asset at a price that makes sense for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $1,200,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $800,000, which fits within your budget.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy the product from John at a much more favorable price."
