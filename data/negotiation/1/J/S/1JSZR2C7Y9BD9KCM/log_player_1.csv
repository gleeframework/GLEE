Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems pretty firm on his $1,150,000 offer.  It's a significant profit above John's offer, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether."
