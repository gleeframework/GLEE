"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm currently only able to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.  I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target,  I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and the maximum I can currently offer.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and understand your position.  Let's aim to finalize this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a very fair price for a product of this caliber.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm still a little above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal, as I'm confident this is a good compromise for both of us.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
