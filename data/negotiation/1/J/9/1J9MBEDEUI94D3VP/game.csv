"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves room for both of us to profit. I believe this is a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
