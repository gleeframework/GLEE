While I could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly nearing his maximum price. Accepting his offer of $1,365,000 is a very good deal and avoids the risk of him walking away completely.  It's better to secure a strong profit now than to risk getting closer to my minimum price or losing the deal altogether."
