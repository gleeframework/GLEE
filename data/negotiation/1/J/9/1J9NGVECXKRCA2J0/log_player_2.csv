"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  While Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000, Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there is room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  He should counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the range of Bob's valuation.  This aggressive strategy aims to force Alice to either accept a lower price or come back with a more reasonable counteroffer.  It's important to note that Bob still has the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails, so he has leverage in this situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is a bit closer to Bob's valuation, but it's still too high. Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating.  He has room to lower the price further, and he can always choose to buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, moving closer to Alice's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still trying to get a better deal. He's likely hoping Alice will meet him halfway and settle on a price around $1,200,000. This strategy balances persistence in negotiation with a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's still some room for negotiation, and Bob should reject this offer and try to get a lower price. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. He can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a significant move by offering $1,250,000. This is significantly closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a favorable price. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness in the negotiation but also hints at his willingness to walk away if Alice doesn't meet him halfway. This approach aims to create a sense of urgency for Alice and potentially lead to a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price, and Bob's counteroffers are not yielding much progress.  It's becoming increasingly likely that the negotiation will continue without a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid potentially getting stuck in a drawn-out negotiation with no clear end, Bob should buy from John at $1,500,000.  This ensures he gets the product while minimizing the risk of further haggling with Alice that might not lead to a better deal."
