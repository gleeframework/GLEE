Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding the asking price, aiming to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, suggesting Alice is open to discussing the price further if Bob counters.

This approach maximizes the chance of getting a price closer to $1,200,000 from Bob while still ensuring a sale if he declines."
