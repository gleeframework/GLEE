"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1650000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1550000. This is my final offer as I am very mindful of my spending limits.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1550000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I propose a price of $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
