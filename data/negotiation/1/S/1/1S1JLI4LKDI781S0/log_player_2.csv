Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on $11,500. It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us and we could finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $12,250 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum.  Since he can buy the product from John for $12,000, this is the best option."
