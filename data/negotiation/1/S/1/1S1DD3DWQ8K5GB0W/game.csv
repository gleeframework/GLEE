"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $990000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",990000.0,Bob,6,
