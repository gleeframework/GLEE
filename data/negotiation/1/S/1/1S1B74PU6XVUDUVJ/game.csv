"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can purchase it from John for $8000.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money.",10500.0,Alice,3,
