"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000.  This is a unique opportunity for you to own a truly valuable asset. I believe this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potentially negotiating further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1500000. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price reflects the unique value of the product and leaves room for both of us to make a deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value of similar products.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1250000 is still a bit low.  Given the unique value of this product and my need to earn a reasonable profit, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the market value and the potential you'll gain from owning this product.  If you're serious about purchasing it, I urge you to accept this final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1350000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a compromise. I'm offering $1230000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
