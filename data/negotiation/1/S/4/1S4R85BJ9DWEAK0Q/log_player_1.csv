``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the product's value and uniqueness to pique Bob's interest.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I explicitly state my willingness to negotiate, showing flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* If the negotiation stalls or goes below $1,000,000, I'll stop negotiating and sell to John."

# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1500000. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

```

**Explanation:**
