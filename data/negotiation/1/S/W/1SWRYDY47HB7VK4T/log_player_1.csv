Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its true worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1300000

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,300,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial ""discount"" if he recognizes its true potential.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's even more advantageous.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the potential of a higher sale to Bob without completely alienating him with an unreasonable price. If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still secured with John's guaranteed purchase at $1,500,000."
