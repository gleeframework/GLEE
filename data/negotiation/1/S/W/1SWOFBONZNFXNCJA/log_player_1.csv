Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This means any offer above that price would be profitable for him.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better outcome. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, but potentially appealing enough to entice him to negotiate or accept outright. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, starting with a strong offer gives us room to negotiate or move to John, ensuring we achieve at least our minimum desired price."
