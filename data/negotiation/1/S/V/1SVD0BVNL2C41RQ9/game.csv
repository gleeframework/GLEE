"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $950,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, as it is well below the estimated value of $1,000,000 to your company. I'm confident this acquisition would be mutually beneficial. However, I have another interested buyer ready to pay $800,000 if you decline this offer. Please let me know your decision within [Timeframe] to ensure we can move forward efficiently.",950000.0,Alice,1,
