"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a good chunk of the value difference.  This price is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.  We'll see if he bites or counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $15,000, and it gets me closer to my goal of maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price.  There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,200. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,900. While it's not the highest price I hoped for, it's getting close to my desired range and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower amount."
