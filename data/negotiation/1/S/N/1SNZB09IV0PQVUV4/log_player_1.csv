Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to make a deal at $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.
* **Backup Option:** The safety net of John's $800,000 offer provides a strong fallback position, allowing Alice to confidently negotiate for a higher price with Bob."
