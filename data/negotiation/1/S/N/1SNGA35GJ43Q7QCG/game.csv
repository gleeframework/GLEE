"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  This offer reflects the product's significant potential and is a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While I value finding common ground, I believe $1,350,000 undervalues the product's potential.  My final offer is $1,360,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
