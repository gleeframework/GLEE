"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12000 is a good price point, I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - $13500. It's a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
