Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I understand that the product is worth more to you, but I need to stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1000000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
