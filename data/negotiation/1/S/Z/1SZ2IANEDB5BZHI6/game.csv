"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,750.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,750 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,500, which is still a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
