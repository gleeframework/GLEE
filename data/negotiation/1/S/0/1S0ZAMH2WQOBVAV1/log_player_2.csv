Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for a product that's worth so much to you. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $115 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $125.  This would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125, and you have a guaranteed option for $120 with John. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and avoid further negotiation."
