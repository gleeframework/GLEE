"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a good profit.  It's important to start high, but not too high, as we want to avoid Bob immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer more, accepting this offer would mean a profit of $2,500, which is significant and better than selling to John for $8,000.  There is a risk that further negotiation will result in a lower price, so it's best to accept this offer while it's still within my range."
