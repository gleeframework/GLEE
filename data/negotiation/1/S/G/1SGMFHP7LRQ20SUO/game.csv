"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
