Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $150 is my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $130?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I can't let this go for $100.  $120 is the absolute lowest I can go.  It's a fantastic deal for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is offering the product for $120, which is still more than what you're willing to pay.  Since you can buy the product from John for $100, it makes more sense to go with John's offer."
