"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I believe this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than where I can go right now.  I'm feeling comfortable at $11,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground there.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
