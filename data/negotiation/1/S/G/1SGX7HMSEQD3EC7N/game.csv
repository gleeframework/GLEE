"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interests. However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
