Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow pace.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's standing offer of $1,200,000 within the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for Alice at this point."
