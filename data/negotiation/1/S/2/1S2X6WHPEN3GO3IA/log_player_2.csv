Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer and won't go lower.  Since her final offer of $850,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000, it's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and buy from John. There's no guarantee Alice will budge, and continuing negotiations might not result in a better outcome."
