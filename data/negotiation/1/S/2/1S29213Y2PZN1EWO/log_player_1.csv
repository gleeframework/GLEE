Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make this offer very attractive to secure a deal with you. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and your minimum price without revealing it.  This creates a sense of exclusivity and potential for a ""deal.""
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:**  Offering a price at $1,300,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's $800,000 valuation but still potentially appealing if he sees the product as strategically valuable. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John if Bob refuses. This gives you a strong position to negotiate from. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's reaction. If he flat out rejects the initial offer, you can gradually decrease the price, but never go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
