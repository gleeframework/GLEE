"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $7,500. How about we try $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
