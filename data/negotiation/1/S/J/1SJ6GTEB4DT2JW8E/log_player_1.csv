{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've expressed interest in. I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very satisfied with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $7,500. How about we try $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and allows me to close the deal without risking losing out to John."
