You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a low offer of $950,000 is a strong opening move. This price is significantly below Alice's asking price but still reflects a value that is higher than your absolute maximum. It sets the stage for a negotiation and creates room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal value.  Rejecting this offer gives you another opportunity to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but is still too high. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying below your maximum threshold. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice is determined to get closer to her target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to your maximum price of $1,000,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next offer and you'll have to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the most likely way to get the product for a price slightly above your ideal, but still within your acceptable range."
