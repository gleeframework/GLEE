"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than what John is offering. You can save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
