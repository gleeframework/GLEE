# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously crafted to meet the highest standards of excellence. This unique item holds significant value for me, reflecting years of dedication and innovation. I believe its true worth exceeds $10000, but considering your potential appreciation and use, I am willing to extend this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $15000. I trust that you will find immense value in this product, and it will serve you well for years to come. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. You have no incentive to negotiate further because you can get the product from John for the same price.  Negotiating with Alice carries the risk of her rejecting your counteroffers, which could lead to a higher price or losing the deal entirely."
