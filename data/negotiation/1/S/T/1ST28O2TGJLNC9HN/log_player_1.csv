"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high with $10,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to get a good starting point and see if Bob is truly interested. If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about negotiating, and we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, and I've already wasted a few rounds. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
