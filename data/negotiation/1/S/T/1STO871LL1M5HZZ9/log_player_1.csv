"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for a product worth much more. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This price gives me flexibility in future rounds, and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a better deal if he negotiates. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible while also ensuring a smooth negotiation process. 
*  I'll closely monitor Bob's responses and adjust my offers accordingly. 
* If the negotiation drags on, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price, which ensures a safe fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we start closer to that? I'm thinking $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While his offer does acknowledge the value of the product, it's far too low for me to consider.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain my position:** I need to stick to my minimum price to ensure I don't lose out on a significant amount of value.
* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's current offer.
* **Keep John as a fallback:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safe option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't reach a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While your offer is a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I start by acknowledging his offer to show that I'm listening and open to negotiation.
* **Middle ground compromise:** I'm offering $1,250,000, which is the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on value and common ground:**  I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize finding common ground. This encourages Bob to see the value in the offer and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Step-by-step approach:** By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to accept his extremely low offer. 
* **Maintain a balance:**  The $1,250,000 counteroffer still gives me room to negotiate further if necessary, while also being a significant improvement on Bob's last offer. 
* **Stay open to negotiation:** I'm ready to adjust my counteroffer depending on Bob's response, but I'll stick to my minimum price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit high for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but it needs to work with my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While he's showing interest, the gap is too large for me to consider accepting.

**Strategy:**

* **Hold firm on my minimum:** I need to stick to my minimum price to ensure I don't lose out on a significant amount of value.
* **Counter with a compromise:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Stay mindful of the clock:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic with my counteroffers. If the negotiation doesn't progress quickly, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your concerns about the price. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I truly believe this product is worth it for you.  We're getting closer to a deal, so let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I start by acknowledging Bob's concerns about the price to show I'm listening and trying to find a solution.
* **Strategic compromise:** I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a substantial drop from my previous offer but still above my minimum price.  This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining my position.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping to persuade him to see the value in my offer.
* **Positive framing:** I use phrases like ""getting closer"" and ""finding a solution"" to keep the conversation constructive and hopeful.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing compromise and firmness:**  I'm willing to make compromises, but I'm also sticking to a price that's close to my minimum.
* **Time pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to make progress quickly. This offer is a strong move towards a deal but still gives me room to adjust if necessary.
* **Keeping John as an option:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John if this negotiation doesn't lead to a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I can see we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit of $1,000,000 for this purchase. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still not enough. With only 4 rounds left and the risk of further negotiation with an uncertain outcome, I've decided to accept John's offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only four rounds left, the negotiation is becoming time-sensitive.  There's a risk of further delays and counteroffers that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a quick and secure sale.
* **Minimizing risk:** By selling to John, I eliminate the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffers or making unreasonable demands in the remaining rounds.

**Decision:**

Selling to John is the most prudent decision at this point, considering the time constraints and the potential for a better guaranteed outcome."
