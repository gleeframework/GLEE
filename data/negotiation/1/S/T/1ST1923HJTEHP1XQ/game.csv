"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $13,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me is $15,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to accept $14,500 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $15,750. This is as close as I can get to my minimum price, considering the product's worth to me is $15,000. What do you think?",15750.0,Alice,5,
