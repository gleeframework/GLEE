"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraint, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps meet at $100? I believe that would be fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone quite low, and I'm not willing to go any lower. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
