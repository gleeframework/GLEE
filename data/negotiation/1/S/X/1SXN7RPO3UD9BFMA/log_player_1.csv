Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,100,000 creates a sense of value while still being significantly above Bob's perceived worth. This leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer and still land on a price beneficial to you.
* **Backup Plan:** The guaranteed sale to John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the initial offer or negotiations fail, you're not losing out.

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming to get the best possible price from Bob while having a secure alternative."
