Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than your minimum desired price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also above Bob's perceived value, leaving potential for him to counteroffer and eventually reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep the cost below $1000000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. How about $1,050,000? This reflects the value of the product to you, and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
