"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  I understand its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $1,200,000 is just too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but let's find a compromise. I'm offering $1,300,000.  This gives you a great deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* – how about $1,275,000? This would give you a great deal, and it gets me closer to my goal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think we're getting close to my limit. How about $1,240,000?",1240000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $1,240,000 is still too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,260,000. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's a compromise between our last offers.  Let's make a deal and move forward!",1260000.0,Alice,7,
