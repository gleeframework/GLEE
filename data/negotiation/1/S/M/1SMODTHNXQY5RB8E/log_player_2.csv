"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $1,000,000 to you. However, I'm looking to get a fair price for it, considering its value to me is $1,200,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you, and I believe you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
