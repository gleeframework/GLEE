"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us to both benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  I believe this is our last offer, but I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
