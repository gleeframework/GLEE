"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is unfortunately far beyond my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing for a profitable transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm eager to strike a deal, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  Could you consider $1,800,000? This price reflects the true worth of this product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the product's value, $1,800,000 is still beyond my acceptable range.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This price leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it reflects the market value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
