You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get it lower. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can push for a price closer to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $710,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. I'm hoping this counteroffer is close enough to her desired price that she will accept it, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $730,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $730,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $730,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation. While I would still prefer to pay $710,000, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I may not be able to reach a lower price, and I might run out of rounds before I can close the deal.  

Therefore, accepting this offer allows me to purchase the product for a price that is lower than John's offer, while still giving me some savings compared to my initial offer."
