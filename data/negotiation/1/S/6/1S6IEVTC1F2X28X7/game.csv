"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $135 is a bit steep for me.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $115 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $120?  That's my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",120.0,Bob,4,
