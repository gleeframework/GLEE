"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price still offers you a significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Let's try $850,000. That's a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is still a bit low for me,  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This demonstrates a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal!",825000.0,Alice,7,
