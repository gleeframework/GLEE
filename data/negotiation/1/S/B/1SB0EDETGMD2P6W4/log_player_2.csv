"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know you value it highly, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's well above what I would get elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($120) is lower than John's price ($150).** This means you save $30 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **You value the product at $150**, so even at $120, you're still getting a good deal."
