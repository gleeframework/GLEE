"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I understand it holds a similar value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000.  This price reflects the unique value of the product and provides a reasonable margin for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than buying from John, it's still above your maximum budget. You're aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best choice."
