"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11,000 is the best price for this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
