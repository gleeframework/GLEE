"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $120.  If you're willing to drop to $120, I'm ready to buy it right now.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you about the value of the product, but I'm still only able to go up to $120.  It's my final offer, and if you're willing to accept it, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
