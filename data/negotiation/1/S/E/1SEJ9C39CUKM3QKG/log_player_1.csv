"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm serious about selling to Bob, but also highlights the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still above Bob's offer. I believe this price is a fair compromise and allows for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than the previous round, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm further lowering my price to show I'm flexible and eager to close the deal. However, I'm still above Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is approaching my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I'm confident that I can secure a better price through further negotiation, or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price. This is likely my final offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if he rejects, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm concerned about running out of time and being forced to settle for a lower price than I'd like. I'm confident John will buy the product for my desired price, so I'll sell it to him and avoid the risk of getting a subpar deal with Bob."
