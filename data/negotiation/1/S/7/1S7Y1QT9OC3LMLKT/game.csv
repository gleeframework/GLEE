"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $900,000?  That's a fair compromise, and still gives you a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
