**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably in price and is now offering the product for $875,000. While we could try to push for $850,000, there's a risk Alice might hold firm or only come down marginally. Accepting at $875,000 secures a significant saving compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
