{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than your minimum value of $15,000. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* The message is friendly and enthusiastic, aiming to create a positive first impression and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential earnings:**  Starting high allows for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  Bob's response will reveal his willingness to pay and how much room there is for negotiation. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net and allows you to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, you show you're not desperate to sell at the minimum. This could encourage Bob to offer more.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Even if Bob doesn't increase his offer, you can always counter with a price slightly higher than $15,000. 
* **Assess Bob's commitment:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate further will reveal how much he truly wants the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I value the product at more than $15,000, I'm willing to come down to $17,500 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this price would be a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives you the opportunity to potentially secure a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows you're not desperate to sell at that price. It suggests you have other options, making Bob more likely to consider increasing his offer.
* **Potential for higher profit:** You can counter with a price closer to your desired range, perhaps around $16,000.
* **Assess Bob's commitment:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate further will give you a better understanding of how much he truly values the product. 

**Next Step:**

You should prepare a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than $14,000 but lower than your previous offer of $17,500.  A counteroffer of $16,000 could be a good starting point for the next round of negotiation."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'd like to make one more offer. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $13,500 is below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal entirely is high. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit and ensures you don't lose out on a valuable opportunity.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure profit:** Selling to John ensures a safe and guaranteed profit, eliminating the risk of further negotiation.
* **Minimize risk:** Continued negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him walking away entirely, leaving you with no sale.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag out the process and delay your profit.  

**Next Steps:**

You should inform Bob that you're accepting John's offer and politely decline his final offer. It's crucial to maintain a professional and respectful tone during this communication."
