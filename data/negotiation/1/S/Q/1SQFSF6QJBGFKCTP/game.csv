"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I value the product at more than $15000, I'm willing to come down to $17500 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think this price would be a good compromise. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product at more than $14000, I'm willing to come down to $16000 to make this deal work.  I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value and the significant price reduction I've already made. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'd like to make one more offer. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
