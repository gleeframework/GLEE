"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
 Bob is offering significantly less than I'm willing to accept. While I need to be strategic, I'm not desperate to sell at that low price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true value and would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I believe I can negotiate a better price and I don't want to risk losing a better offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  To be fair, I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope you'll consider it. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,275,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can get him to come up a bit more.  I'm not giving up on getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,275,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm thinking $1,300,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and close the deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers.  I'm going to take John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's a much better deal, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that profit."
