"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $8000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $17000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $10000. It's a fair price considering my budget and what I'm looking for in this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
