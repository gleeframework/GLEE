"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth at least $10,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer:

The product is worth $10,000 to me. It's still too early to accept Alice's offer of $11,000.  I can try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above my value of $10,000.  I'm going to go ahead and buy from John for $10,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice at this point."
