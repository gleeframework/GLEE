"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I know it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price around $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $9,000 would be more reasonable.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $10,000 is getting closer.  Tell you what, to show I'm serious about making a deal, I'll come down to $10,750.  This is my final offer.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can tell we're getting close to a deal that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $10,250 and call it a day?",10250.0,Bob,6,
