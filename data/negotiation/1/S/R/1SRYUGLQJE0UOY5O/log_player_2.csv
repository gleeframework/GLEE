Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further.  We'll counter with a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, $10,000 is getting closer.  Tell you what, to show I'm serious about making a deal, I'll come down to $10,750.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though Alice says this is her final offer, we still have room to negotiate. We'll push a little further down, but we need to be ready to accept a price around $10,500 in case she's truly firm."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can tell we're getting close to a deal that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $10,250 and call it a day?"",
