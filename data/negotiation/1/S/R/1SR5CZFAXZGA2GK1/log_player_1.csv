"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. This way, I can hopefully pique Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115? I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm increasing the price a bit from Bob's offer but still offering a compromise. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also protects my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $105. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'd like to try and push for a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'd be willing to go up to $108. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to an agreement! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $109. This is my final offer, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $109, which is just slightly higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'm also adding a sense of urgency by calling it my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I'd like to try one more time. I can offer $107, that's the absolute most I can stretch. If you can meet me there, I'd be willing to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price,  $107 is still not satisfactory. I'm running out of time, and with only two rounds left, I risk not reaching my desired price. It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk ending up with a lower price."
