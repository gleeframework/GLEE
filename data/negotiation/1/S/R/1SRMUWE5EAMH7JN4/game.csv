"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. While $1,200,000 is certainly appealing, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This price represents a compromise that I believe is fair to both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,225,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
