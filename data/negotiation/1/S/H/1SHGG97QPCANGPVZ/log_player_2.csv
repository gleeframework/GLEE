"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product, given my assessment of its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has come down from her initial price,  $925,000 is still significantly more than my target price of $800,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for some profit for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
