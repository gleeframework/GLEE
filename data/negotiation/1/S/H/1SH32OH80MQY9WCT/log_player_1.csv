"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll gauge his interest with a price that's well above my minimum. If he's truly interested, he might counter, giving me a better understanding of his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent profit, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $980,000. This is a compromise that still offers me a good profit, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that will close the deal without risking losing him completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $960,000 is a good price that's closer to my desired value and significantly better than what John is offering.  While I could try to get a higher price, I've already rejected Bob's previous offer, and further negotiation might risk losing him altogether. It's time to secure the deal."
